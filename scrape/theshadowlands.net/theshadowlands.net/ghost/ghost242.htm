<BR><B>Haunted chapel in Finland</B>
<BR><B>Jopo610@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>In the early 1960s I was a missionary for the Mormon church, living
in a small city on the West coast of Finland. A few miles to the North
is another city where two other missionaries lived and worked.&nbsp; There
our chapel was an old two story house, a wood building with a metal mansard
roof.&nbsp; The first floor was our chapel and classrooms, etc., and the
missionaries lived on the second floor.&nbsp; The building was assumed
to be haunted, as there were many incidences of lights turning on my themselves,
toilets flushing, windows opening, and all the usual poltergeist activity.&nbsp;
The elders put up with it, finding it mildly amusing and harmless.</B>

<P><B>One night, however, they were awakened to discover a white shirt
hanging in midair in their room as though someone was holding it by the
shoulders.&nbsp; It fell to the floor, and the missionaries spent the rest
of the night with all the lights on. In the morning they called the Mission
President in Helsinki asking permission to move to another residence.&nbsp;
What happened after this, I don't know, and there is no way I can research
this now after so many years.&nbsp; If anyone out there has heard of this
incident, I would enjoy hearing about it</B>

<P><B>In response to this story-</B>
<BR><B>When I was fifteen years old we had two brother Doberman pinschers.&nbsp;
Zeus and Apollo.&nbsp; Apollo was horrible about climbing fences, running
off, things a misbehaving dog would do.&nbsp; Also, just to mention the
dogs where born on my fathers birthday.&nbsp; In August my father went
in the hospital.&nbsp; For sixteen days we where in ICU hoping for the
best.&nbsp; We would go home do clothes feed the dogs etc.&nbsp; On a Thursday
morning they called us in to tell us that my father had passed.&nbsp; So
we all drove home, the drive is around 15 minutes.&nbsp; After we arrived
home my older brother went outside to find that Apollo had died.&nbsp;
Zeus was fine but the trouble maker of the two had passed away sometime
between my mom calling us to come to the hospital at 8 that morning, and
11 we got home.&nbsp; So Apollo had my dad's birthday and his day of death..</B>

<P><B>Another story...</B>
<BR><B>I lived in the same house my entire life.&nbsp; I have heard stories
that my sisters and mother have experienced, but I have had my on experiences.&nbsp;
It started when I was about 10.&nbsp; My bed was in front of the door leading
out into the hall.&nbsp; One night I woke up to see a lady with long white
hair, in a white night gown.&nbsp; I remembered the night gown as it was
my own.&nbsp; It had lace around the sleeves and the&nbsp; bottom, it was
long sleeved and Ved at the neck line.&nbsp; I never told anyone about
this until about a year ago (12 years later).&nbsp; I was telling my mom
about the lady that I had saw.&nbsp; Her face literally went white.&nbsp;
She begin to tell me that years before I was born I had a Great Grandmother
that died.&nbsp; She told me that when her and my father would go stay
with her she would get the chills because she always wore that long white
night gown and had long white hair, and even in living she looked like
she was a ghost.</B>

<P><B>Another thing that I used to see was a short man, with black tuxedo,
and a black top hat.&nbsp; I would&nbsp; awake and he would be standing
in my doorway.&nbsp; I never thought any thing of it, until on night I
had a sleep over and awoke to one of the girls screaming.&nbsp; We turned
on the light and she said that she saw a little man in a black tuxedo and&nbsp;
a black top hat standing in the doorway.&nbsp; This was in the living room
not my bedroom so I than began to believe that he went wherever I went.</B>

<P><B>When my sister was younger she begged and begged for this doll that
my grandma had.&nbsp; After a couple of years my grandma gave it to her.&nbsp;
My mom said that the doll always creeped her out because she thought that
it's eyes were following her.&nbsp; (All of this was before I was born).&nbsp;
One night (in the same room that would become my room in five years) my
sister awoke and went and got my mother because there was a lot of banging
and rustling happening in the closet.&nbsp; Earlier in the night my sister
had got in trouble and my mom but the doll into the closet.&nbsp; When
my mom got in the room she heard the noise, thinking it my be a mouse she
turned the light on and proceeded to open the closet door.&nbsp; When she
opened it the doll was turned upside down.&nbsp; My sister swore she did
not touch the doll.&nbsp; The next morning my mom took the doll outside
and burned it.&nbsp; She said it took all day before the doll finally burned.</B>
<BR><B>These are a few of the stories that I have had.&nbsp; Sorry for
the poor grammer.</B>

<BR><B>Mom's still helping</B>
<BR><B>kweslager@charter.net</B>

<P><B>This happened about 2 weeks after my mothers funeral, I had just
turned 24.&nbsp; My friend and I went out to a local bar.&nbsp; We stayed
there until it closed.&nbsp; Then we went to a friend of her's to drink
some more.&nbsp; Mind you, I was driving, and I have always been against
drinking and driving since I lost a friend to it.&nbsp; When we decided
to leave, I told her that our husbands were never going to come and get
us, and that I couldn't drive.&nbsp; She was worse than I was, so she was
just babbling.&nbsp; We sat in my car, trying to clear my head.&nbsp; In
the condition I was in, it would be nearly impossible for me to drive without
at LEAST an accident.&nbsp; I decided in my drunken stuper to just drive.&nbsp;
I asked my mother "If you get me home without hurting anyone, including
myself, I swear, I'll never let this happen again."&nbsp; I started to
drive, there was even a police officer behind me, but I drove perfect.&nbsp;
I looked at the clock it was 3:32 a.m.&nbsp;&nbsp; I got home thinking
I would just go to sleep, knowing my husband who is severely deaf, and
does not wake up to anything, would be in bed.&nbsp; I walked in my front
door, and there he stood.&nbsp; Yelling and screaming.&nbsp; The next day,
I asked him if he waited up for me to come home.&nbsp; He said he fell
asleep on the couch, and he felt someone nudging him, like it was time
for work.&nbsp; He stated, that it was real cold in the room, for June,
it's never cold.&nbsp; That's when he looked at the clock and it said 3:32
a.me. and realized I wasn't home.</B>

<P><B>Now anyone who knew my mom in life, knew, that if you ever asked
her for a favor, of this type, she would be like "Oh, I'll help ya, but
you'll pay for it!".&nbsp; Well, I did, horrible hangover, plus a very
upset husband.&nbsp; I guess, I got it mom, but thanks for getting me home.</B>

<P><B>My house isn’t that old but when my sister lived here we would wake
up to the slamming of cabinet doors and we would go to the kitchen and
see them slamming when no one was touching them well at least no one we
could see. Well our house has like always had a lot of things like that
and i don’t know how it isn’t old enough to have people that died there.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that my sister moved out its not as bad but
like every once and a while the cabinets slam and doors open and fans turn
on when they weren’t turned on by me and on time my music was on softly
and it suddenly changed stations and it was like blasting when I didn’t
touch it. All of these things have happened in the middle of the night.</B>

<BR><B>Michigan Farmhouse</B>
<BR><B>BexBall7@aol.com</B>

<P><B>My name is Bekah and I am 18 years old. When I was about two years
old, we moved into this beautiful farmhouse in Michigan. I of course don't
remember actually moving, but I remember loving that house more than anything.
When we moved in, it was already well over 100 years old and still in great
shape. In the early 1900's it had been a restaurant and I thought this
was the coolest thing ever. I remember my Great Great Aunt Nell telling
me how she used to eat at that restaurant after church on Sundays. I don't
remember when I actually started seeing and feeling things in that house,
but the first time I can remember was when I was about 5 years old. The
house had 4 bedrooms and mine was the second biggest. My parents, of course,
had the biggest and my brother still slept in the nursery. My room was
at the very end of the hallway and it always seemed to be the coldest.
I had a door in my room that lead outside to a balcony and from my bed,
I made sure that I could see that door and my bedroom door (I had always
been somewhat of a chicken). The first night that anything happened, I
remember waking up in my room with an incredible sense of fear. I don't
know what triggered it because I didn't see anything around me. I sat up
in bed for a few minutes just looking around and saw nothing, so I laid
back down to go back to sleep. Right after lying down, I felt the presence
of someone or something in my room and turned over to look at the door.
I didn't see anything again, but was even more frightened. I got up and
out of bed to go to my parents bedroom, and just as I took a step away
from my bed I felt a breeze go through the room. None of my windows were
open and the door to the balcony was not open either because mom and dad
always kept that locked and only they knew where the key was. I was terrified
and ran to my parent’s bedroom. I told them what happened and told them
that someone was in my room, they didn't believe me, but I still got to
sleep with them that night.</B>
<BR><B>Weeks passed and almost every night the same thing would happen
over and over again. I was beginning to get used to it and I wasn't all
that afraid anymore. Months had passed since that first night, but then
something else happened, I woke up in the middle of the night again but
this time I didn't get the same feeling that I had before. This feeling
was bad and it wasn't because I was scared. I knew something different
was happening than what had happened all the other nights. I laid in bed,
terrified of even moving, when a hot air which I can only describe as breath,
washed over me. The hair on the back of my neck stood up and all I could
do was huddle under my covers in hope that this thing wouldn't hurt me.
By this time I had had my 6th birthday, and at 6, I didn't know what it
could do to me and what it couldn't. Finally I got the courage to run out
of my room and into my parents room where I slept the entire night and
several nights after that. I didn't really understand things because we
always went to church and my parents are and were incredible Christians.
They always told me that anything evil couldn't touch me as long as God
was with me. (They obviously didn't believe what I had been telling them.)
I believed this only after several weeks of this thing visiting me. See,
it came, but it never hurt me. Although it had been there several weeks,
I still was not used to it. I actually missed the old spirit that had made
a habit of coming to my room, because after the evil one started coming,
it didn't come back. This went on until I was about 7. I finally got so
fed up with it that I actually told it to leave me alone and that God would
protect me. I never felt it again. But then other things were happening.
During the night, I would wake up and hear things on the first floor of
the house like people walking around and talking. We had wooden floors
downstairs and you could hear their shoes clicking on the floor. Then I
started to hear music and what I could only describe as plates and silverware
banging together. I started to get more bold and tried walking down the
stairs to see what it was, but when I got downstairs, nothing was there
and I couldn't hear anything anymore. This happened once or twice a week
up until we moved out when I was 10. When I was about 8, I woke up in the
middle of the night to footsteps coming up the stairs. I knew that whatever
it was, was going to come to my room, so I ran to my brothers room and
got into bed with him. I was lying there facing the opposite wall when
whatever it was came into the room I was in and sat on the bed. I was too
scared to look at it, but now regret that I didn't.</B>
<BR><B>Things would happen when I had friends over too. Only two of my
friends would actually spend the night with me. We would sit up and watch
TV downstairs and hear things banging together in the kitchen and when
we would get up the courage to look, there wasn't anything there. The weirdest
thing that would happen when friends were over, was that the toilet seat
would go up. There was a bathroom right off the living room and we would
hear a bang and when we looked, the toilet lid would be up. The last thing
that I encountered there was on my last night in the house. I remember
lying there crying because I didn't want to leave. All of a sudden, a familiar
cool breeze was in the room. I sat up and there she was again. I knew it
was a woman because this time I actually saw her figure. She had beautiful
long hair and a long blue dress on. I can remember her so clearly. I could
see that she was crying and I asked her why. All she did was point to me.
Then she disappeared. I haven't seen anything or felt anything since. I
was talking about this to my mother about a year ago and told her about
the footsteps and voices that I would hear. She looked at me and told me
that she used to hear them too when she was up in the night.</B>

<BR><B>Marbles, Doors, and Running</B>
<BR><B>greenvelvet_16@hotmail.com</B>

<P><B>Right after I started dating my future husband I was thrilled to
find out he lived in a huge old Craftsman style house that was built in
1919. The house was beautiful with huge rooms, strange little closets,
and beautiful wood work. One day after we had been together for a while
my husband told me that the house was haunted. He told me that the people
who lived there before said they heard weird noises and what sounded like
kids playing with marbles on the upstairs landing. I had several ghost
experiences with ghosts before ehwn I was younger and did not feel any
malevolent or foreboding feelings in the house. It didn't bother me so
I didn't think about it.</B>
<BR><B>Then one night around 11pm, my future husband and I were laying
in his bed room with the lights off listening to the radio. His door was
open a little way because it wouldn't close all the way because it was
warped. I was going to leave when all of the sudden we heard "roll roll
roll, plink plink" Like something was rolling across the wooden landing
and hitting the steam radiator at the head of the stairs. Once again, I
didn't feel any threatening force and it was kind of cool.</B>
<BR><B>Some time later, he and I were watching TV in his parent's room.
We were the only ones home except for the cat, who was with us. It was
around 8 pm. At one point, I heard a door slam downstairs, and then the
sound of someone running up the stairs and pausing right before the landing.
The door was wide open and you could see the top of the stairs, and there
was definitely no one there. Even the cat had turned to see who it was.&nbsp;
I asked my husband if he had heard it, and he said he didn't hear anything.
About five minutes later he asked me "if I had heard . . ." and then described
perfectly what I hadn't told him I'd heard. it turns out he had just been
trying to be macho for me. It only frightened me to have heard it so clearly.</B>
<BR><B>The last thing I remember happening was one night we spent the night
there alone. We were going to go up to his room and watch a movie. When
we got there, his bedroom door was shut.&nbsp; He pushes against it with
all his might, and could not budge it. There wasn't a lock on the door,
and like I said earlier the door was warped and didn't close all the way.
He pushed on the door and jiggled the handle and then whispered for me
to go downstairs. He followed after a second and told me he could feel
someone pushing against the door from the other side and was afraid someone
had broken into the house, even though it was on the second floor and impossible
to climb in the window. He called his grandma just case anything was going
to happen, then he got his step dad's shot gun out of the closet and went
back upstairs. I followed him, and he yelled to whoever he thought was
in the room that he was coming in, and then he had to kick the door in.
No one was in the room, and later we found that the wood on the bottom
of his bed had been broken.&nbsp; We closed the closet door at some point
and later in the night I looked up to find it open again, and we had made
sure it was securely shut. After that night we were both scared to death
to be alone in that house, especially at night. I never did get a chance
to research it's history-</B>

<BR><B>My Experiences</B>
<BR><B>rogue_princess@hotmail.com</B>

<P><B>When I was about five years old we loved in Macorna. I remember one
night I was told to go to bed so that mum and dad could watch a movie,
but being the stubborn child I was I snuck up and watch the movie from
the lounge room door. However I began to get tired so I went to bed. All
of the sudden I heard a noise coming from under the bed so I got down on
all fours to check what was under my bed. I could see a shadow of a man.
The next morning I got mum and dad to come and look at it. So there we
all were mum, dad and I all peering under my bed. I could see it plain
as day, but mum and dad couldn't see it. That shadow was under my bed until
the day we moved out of that house. A&nbsp; couple of times after that
first time I asked mum and dad to check if they could see it but they never
could.</B>
<BR><B>You may wonder why I never got frightened by this figure, I suppose
it's because from the very first day we moved into that house I would see
ghostly figures in my room at night. Whenever I went to bed I would say
hello and all of the sudden all of these figures would be standing around
my room. I would talk to them but not verbally. We spoke telekinetically.</B>
<BR><B>Anyway they didn't visit anyone else in the family except for me.
And about six months before we moved out of that house they stopped coming.
One night I said hello and they didn't appear, I asked if they were angry
with me but they just didn't answer. I never saw them again.</B>
<BR><B>I would appreciate it if someone could send me an email to tell
me if the ghosts in my room were there because, for some reason unknown
to me, I needed them. Please send your replies to. rogue_princess@hotmail.com

<BR><B>MAKE YOUR SKIN CRAWL</B>
<BR><B>frypan100@hotmail.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>In am now 45 years old. When i was 18, my Father, Sister and I moved
into a huge newly built house set alone on a hill. It was the day before
Halloween. Oct 30th. I was delighted as I thought I was escaping years
of paranormal activity in my old house. Actually my whole life has been
filled with psychic and paranormal activity, but the last four years since
the poltergeist activity started, it was hell. On Oct. 31st Halloween.
My older sister who no longer lived with us and I went to a costume party.
I was a witch. I met a friend of mine at the party his name was John. he
was 22 at the time. and after the party about 1am, we decided he should
come to my new place and continue conversation for a while. so we are in
the lower level of the house. the ground is at window level down there.
My younger sister was down the hall sleeping. There was a nice even layer
of new snow outside. We were sitting there chatting for about 45 minutes
when suddenly we heard this low but extremely loud moaning. We stopped
talking and listened. the moaning slowly turned into insane maniacal laughter
then back to moaning it was so loud and the sound of the voice was like
none other either of us had ever heard. it literally made our skin crawl.
Now we were freaked. We decided someone was playing a very mean trick on
us for Halloween. so we proceeded to search the entire house, including
the outside which was covered with a light bit of snow, but which made
it possible to determine that no one had been near or around the outside
of the house anytime recently. I first went into my sisters room thinking
she was the cause of this trick. and if she wasn't she had to have been
awakened by the intense loudness of the voice. but she was sound, drooling
asleep. We searched every inch of every piece of furniture, cabinet, room
every space in that house looking for some evidence of how we could have
heard such a horrible thing. John came running back down and said he heard
it again, just about 20 feet from where I was down about 6 steps and around
a corner and I didn't hear it. We went back into the downstairs living
room, and again were victims of this most horrible voice, moaning then
manically laughing etc. Maybe this doesn't sound so bad, but let me elaborate
on the sound of this voice. no where in my whole 45 years have I ever heard
anything to come close to the horrific sound of the voice. The second time
we heard it, we looked at each other and&nbsp; tears were coming out of
our eyes and we were not crying, this continued the rest of the time. Our
skin was literally crawling, both of us. In my whole life since I have
not heard anything to come even close to it. The closest I can come to
describing it is times horrible by 1 million. We heard it a couple more
times, each episode would last approximately 5 minutes.&nbsp; Finally it
seemed to have ceased. and it was late I was exhausted from this event.
He did not want to leave me alone and quite frankly I was glad of it. He
stayed on the couch, and I went to my room. I shut my door and laid awake
the rest of the night, sensing something on the other side of the door
about to come in and if it did it would be horrible. I was terrified.</B>

<BR><B>kate.platts@general-demolition.co.uk</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>Hi there, my name is Kate and I live in Surrey which is in the UK.
I have had a number of experiences so I thought I'd let you know a couple
of them so you can add them to your web site.</B>

<P><B>My grandmother is a medium so I have kind of been brought up to believe
in life after death etc and I do believe that I may be a little physic
myself as I have always been able to feel certain things in certain places
that no one else has felt.</B>

<P><B>My first experience was when I was about 7 years old and I was at
School. My class was having a lesson in the Library and as we made our
way back from that lesson our teacher had realized she had forgotten her
book so she sent myself and another classmate to fetch it for her. The
school Library is at the end of a corridor on the right hand side, you
have to climb a few steps to get to it, on the left hand side of the same
corridor is the doors to the school hall. As we turned into the corridor
we both saw what appeared to be a teenage boy walking a few feet in front
us, within the blink of an eye he had disappeared. Both my classmate and
I had seen him and we looked high and low for him, he didn't go into the
Library or the Hall, he just disappeared right in front of us.</B>

<P><B>A little time after that experience I noticed a plaque on the wall
in the school hall. It turned out that years before my school used to be
a boys school and one of its pupils was killed on a boat in the 2nd World
War and that some of the shelves from the Library were made out of the
wood from the boat that sunk. If I remember rightly, he was wearing an
army style khaki uniform!</B>

<P><B>My father used to live in a 400 year old farm house and that too
was haunted, I used to wake up at 2.43am every morning and listen to heavy
footsteps pass my bedroom heading towards the bathroom. I knew it couldn't
have been my dad, as he had an en suite bathroom in his bedroom!</B>

<P><B>Anyway, I thought I'd give you just a couple of my stories to put
on your web site.</B>

<P><B>It seems to have followed me</B>
<BR><B>Anonymous</B>

<P><B>Hello again. I have more experiences to share, if you will be so
kind as to indulge me.</B>

<P><B>I have always been a "scary" person. Maybe growing up in that house
made more sensitive to things, I am not sure. I never liked to watch scary
movies, hated being home alone (even now), and DO NOT like to be completely
in the dark.</B>

<P><B>Once we moved out of that house, I moved in with my Grandparents.
My life from that point was pretty much uneventful. Nothing unusual at
all. I lived there with my grandparents until I was around 24, then my
fianc&eacute; and I bought our own house.</B>

<P><B>It was a very nice, sturdy single home. Beautiful brick &amp; stone
exterior, 3 bedrooms, large rooms, full basement, garage and large backyard.
One of the bedrooms upstairs had a door that opened up, and you could walk
out on top of the garage. The perimeter had a nice "picket fence" around
it, and up until we had children, we used to sit up there at night and
relax. It was occupied by an old woman (my grandfather knew her sons, which
is how we came upon the house for sale). She passed away (in a hospital,
not in this house), and the sons wanted to sell the house.</B>

<P><B>The house was solid in structure, but needed much updating, so we
were able to purchase it at well under market value. Upon making settlement,
we immediately began to work on the house. The kitchen was very, very old.
It always seems that once you start to take things apart, there is always
more work needed underneath. So, we had to strip the kitchen down to the
sub-flooring and almost completely rebuild the kitchen.</B>

<P><B>One particular evening, my fianc&eacute;e, 2 of his friends and myself
were all standing in the kitchen looking at the pipes coming out of the
floor, and discussing where the major appliances were going to go. When
all of a sudden we heard this loud bang. It was loud enough to actually
feel it through the floor. We all stood there and looked at each other.....I
said to my fianc&eacute;, what the heck was that??!! He ran down the basement,
one of his friends ran upstairs and his other friend ran out the front
door. Meanwhile, I stood in the kitchen almost frozen, afraid to move.</B>

<P><B>As each one came back from checking their "areas", each one reported
that everything was in order. Upstairs, all of the doors and windows were
fine. The basement was fine and there was nothing unusual in either the
front or back yard. Once we were all settled and caught our breath, we
discussed this for some time. Trying desperately to come up with a logical
explanation for the noise. But the truth is, there was none.</B>

<P><B>We continued to fix up the house without further incident. It took
about 1-1/2 yrs to fix everything and actually be able to live in it. So,
we finally started moving furniture in, and actually sleeping there. We
had fixed it up quite nicely....modern, but classically decorated. Neutral
tones, lots of warm woodwork, a large 15 x 30 patio out back, and some
nice landscaping. I even mentioned to my fianc&eacute;, that I thought
the woman who used to live here, would have been proud of our improvements.</B>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B>

<P><B>Everything was quiet until after I had my first son in 1993. I'd
say he was around 8 months old when we started hearing noises again. One
evening around 9:30, my husband and I were sitting on the couch watching
TV, our son was upstairs in his crib sleeping. All of a sudden, we heard
a loud bang...almost like someone had slammed the door to the top of the
garage closed. We could almost say it came from that side of the house.
So he went up to check it out, and all of the doors were fine. The 3 bedroom
doors were open and the door to the deck was closed and locked. I want
to point out, that for safety reasons, this door to the top of the garage
was locked with a key. One on the handle and a deadbolt. So, there would
be no accidental opening of this door. We each had a key, on our key rings.
Our son, who would cry at the sound of a distant fire whistle, was still
sound asleep.</B>

<P><B>Then one day, my sister came over. It was hot out and I had the air
on. My husband was at work. My and my son (who was about 2), were just
hanging out watching nickelodeon. She came in and asked to use the bathroom.
So, she went upstairs. When she came back down, she asked why I had the
air on, and the upstairs door open. I told her it wasn't open, and went
up and checked. Sure enough, it was open. Now, as previously stated, it
needed 2 keys to be opened.</B>

<P><B>So, I assured my sister (and myself to be honest), that my husband
must have been out there early this morning. Closed it, but forgot to lock
it, and the wind pushed it open. We were both like, yeah okay, that sounds
reasonable. So, when my husband came home later that night, I asked him
and he said that he had not been out there.</B>

<P><B>For the remainder of our 7 years in this house, we always heard doors
slamming. But when we would check it out, everything would be in order.
For whatever its worth (and I don't know if this means anything at all),
but there were always spiders in this house. My biggest, deepest fear (aside
from flying) is a fear of spiders. And even though we replaced the windows,
had exterminators come every 6 months and were not situated near any woods.
It seemed like our house was almost infested. Maybe someone can tell me
if this is significant.</B>

<P><B>Due to a job opportunity, we sold this house and moved to Florida.
We have stayed in casual contact with the new owners and to the best of
my knowledge; they have not experienced a thing. They have been living
there approx. 4 years now.</B>

<P><B>&nbsp;Before moving to Florida, I had one more son. My children are
2.5 years apart. And I believe that my youngest son (now 6) has the ability
to see, hear and feel ghosts. From the time he was a small child.</B>

<P><B>Well, I must go for now, but will return to continue the story. If
anyone has any comments, please feel free to contact me.</B>
<BR><B>Thanks to everyone for listening. Take care.</B>

<BR><B>My bedroom closet</B>
<BR><B>BaddKittiee@buckeye-express.com</B>

<P><B>I lived with my grandma most of my life.&nbsp; We lived in the same
trailer the whole time. And I am not quite sure if it is possible for trailers
to be haunted but here is my out of the ordinary experience.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;I never , from the time we moved in the trailer, liked my
bedroom closet. There was just something so menacing about it. I know when
you're young everything can be played off as an active imagination. But
there were many nights, I was found sleeping in my grandma's bed. I never
had any kind of actual experience with my closet until I was sixteen.</B>
<BR><B>Before I tell about my unusual occurrence, let me just give a brief
layout of the trailer.</B>
<BR><B>When you walk in the front door, you're in the living room. To the
immediate right was my grandma's bedroom. Go left and you are in the kitchen.
Go through&nbsp; the kitchen to the left and you are in the hallway. There's
a door on the right at the end of the hallway. That's the back door. The
door on the left is the bathroom. And the door straight ahead was my room.</B>
<BR><B>So now on with my tale.</B>
<BR><B>I always got up for school around five am or so because it took
me forever to get ready. I would always turn on my t.v. (it was the old
kind where you have to physically pull on this knob to turn it on or push
it in to turn it off. there was no remote, it had the knobs where you turn
them to change channels and they always made a kind of clicking noise when
you did that.) to have some kind of company in the wee hours of the morning(
my grandma never woke up before eight am - when I was already at school).</B>
<BR><B>One morning, while doing my usual routine of taking a shower, putting
on my makeup , and fixing my hair, I heard my television knobs clicking.
I was curious as to what was making the noise so I walked around the corner
and peeked in my room(my t.v. was on a stand next to the closet) and I
noticed the channel had been changed and my closet door was ajar(it had
been closed, I was sure.)</B>
<BR><B>I quickly went to my grandma's room and peeked in to make sure she
wasn't awake and for some reason had went into my room(but I knew deep
down she hadn't because she always wore slippers that made a distinct noise
coming down the uncarpeted hallway.)</B>
<BR><B>After checking in her room, I grabbed our cordless phone and ran
back into the bathroom to call my best friend whom was also getting ready
for school.&nbsp; I knew she would believe me because she was a big believer
in the paranormal.</B>
<BR><B>Luckily I had already gotten dressed. So i quickly left my house
and met her down the road at her's.</B>
<BR><B>The next morning I decided to test this out. So I left the t.v.
off and opened my closet door.</B>
<BR><B>After my usual getting ready stuff, I went to check things out.
I about flipped! The closet door was shut and my t.v. was on but I hadn't
heard it in the bathroom!</B>
<BR><B>Once again I made a quick departure to my best friend's house.</B>
<BR><B>Nothing ever again occurred with the closet or t.v.</B>
<BR><B>But other things did happen in that trailer. That'll have to be
told another time, though......</B>

<BR><B>My house</B>
<BR><B>Bitterswtkiss@aol.com</B>

<P><B>Hi, my name is Tara and ever since I can remember I have been prone
to the paranormal.&nbsp; I don’t really know why I have this sense and
sometimes I wonder if I even really want it at all. I have learned how
to deal with it, it’s just become another every day thing for me.</B>
<BR><B>I just want to say that I love your site, I feel like I can tell
my stories here and not be laughed at, and for that I thank you!</B>
<BR><B>I am 23 years old and live in the outskirts of Baltimore city.</B>
<BR><B>Anyway, I have a lot of stories but I will try to pick the ones
that are the most outstanding from the group. These stories will have to
do with the house I lived in during high school.</B>
<BR><B>1.&nbsp; When I was about 12 years old my family (mom, dad, brother,
and myself) moved into a house that really wasn’t old, but definitely had
an enormous amount of history to it.&nbsp; We bought the house from a couple
that was in the process of a divorce.&nbsp; We moved in and immediately
started re-decorating.&nbsp; From the first time I stepped foot in the
house I felt uneasy.&nbsp; As time went on I started to ignore it because
I figured it was just my imagination.&nbsp; My parents got divorced a few
years later and my mom swears up and down that there was a vibe in that
house that did not want couples to stay together. The family who moved
in after us also ended up in divorce.</B>
<BR><B>2.&nbsp; One day I was in the basement doing some laundry and I
really felt like there was something behind me…something watching me.&nbsp;
I had cats so I just assumed it was them and that they were hungry. Then
the feeling got overpowering, it was like something was making me look
behind me, I tried as hard as I could not to, but eventually gave in and
turned around. There, just a few feet away from me was what looked like
the shape of a man wearing a black suit and a top hat. I didn’t feel any
fear from him, well, other than the obvious, that I was face-to-face with
a ghost, and then just as quickly as I saw him, he vanished. It was like
he just wanted to be noticed. I never saw him again. But I felt him.</B>
<BR><B>3.&nbsp; I had rearranged my room and my bed was facing the door,
I could see the stairs and what ever was going on in the hallway. One morning
I was laying in my bed fully awake for about an hour, just being lazy,
when I saw what looked like a woman walk up the stairs and into my mother’s
bedroom. My brother was in there at the time watching T.V. I called out
to my brother and asked if that was mom that just came upstairs, he looked
at me like I had 3 heads saying that no one had just come upstairs, mom
was in the basement. I tried to tell my mother, but she didn’t believe
me. Typical, right?</B>
<BR><B>4.&nbsp; Whenever I walked by the upstairs bathroom I would see
what looked like a man out of the corner of my eye. I never felt alone
in that bathroom no matter what I was doing.</B>
<BR><B>5.&nbsp; I had a friend that my ghostly friends just did not like.
The first time she came over to my house, she almost fell down the steps
because on of the ghosts tried to push her. I saw this happen, I was at
the bottom of the steps waiting for her, and when I looked up at her she
was seriously pushed by some unknown source and almost fell on her head,
luckily she caught the rail. I think maybe though they were trying to tell
me something about her&nbsp; because they were never like that with anyone
else and as it turns out she ended up not being as nice as she seemed.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That’s all for now, I’ll tell you about my other
stories another time. This is too long as it is and I haven’t even made
a dent.</B>

<BR><B>My Guardian Angle Ghost</B>
<BR><B>Rich_Distefano@acaicorp.com</B>

<P><B>I was born in 1960 in Philadelphia, PA. and not long after my sixth
birthday until just before my seventh I was visited almost every night
by what I thought at that time was my Guardian Angle.&nbsp; Let me preface
this story with some information about my parents' house.&nbsp; They were
the first owners of a small split-level house in Northeast Philly.&nbsp;
When you come in the front door and walk across the living room you come
to a set of five stairs that lead to the bedrooms.&nbsp; At the top of
the stairs to the right is a bathroom and to the left was my room.&nbsp;
Across my room from the door was a double window that looked out on the
driveway below.&nbsp; From my bed I could look out of my bedroom and down
the stairs to the living room.&nbsp; The apparition would always be the
same and would come after my sister and parents were asleep. A man dressed
in black pants, a white button-down shirt with a white tee shirt, and black
horn-rimmed glasses (he looked a lot like Henry Mitchell, the father from
Dennis the Mennis).&nbsp;&nbsp; This man would walk up the stairs and stop
in my doorway.&nbsp; He would look over at me and nod his head then walk
around the foot of my bed to the side by the windows.&nbsp; He would look
at me again, kneel down and fold his hands on my bed and disappear.&nbsp;
As I said this went on for almost a year.&nbsp; I questioned me parents;
and like most was told it was just a dream.&nbsp; I had this vision three
or four more time in subsequent years until I was about ten and haven't
had it since.&nbsp; Although I was never frightened of the vision I am
still very puzzled as to whom this was and what it meant.&nbsp; The area
was all farm land and my house a field.&nbsp; I don't know any of the history
of the farm or land or if any worker was killed during the construction
of my neighborhood.</B>

<BR><B>My granny and the rocking chair</B>
<BR><B>A.Kent@ukgateway.net</B>

<P><B>I’m 13 yrs old and I live in London and this is my story. My haunting
happened When I was about 7 yrs old. That evening I was just ready to go
to sleep when out of the corner of my eye I noticed someone sitting in
my rocking chair in my bedroom. I turned my head to get a better look at
the apparition and had the courage to turn the light on. The apparition
got out of the chair, walked towards me and then sat on my bed. I didn’t
have a clue who it was, but I presumed mum and dad had gone out and this
was my babysitter. The old lady picked a book up off the floor, handed
it to me, and then slowly walked out of the room- all the while not making
a single sound. Next day I asked mum where they had been the night before,
and, to my surprise, said that they hadn’t been anywhere, let alone out
of the house. This freaked me out! I then went on to ask who the old lady
was, but neither of my parents knew anything about her! Luckily, my parents
truly believed me when I told them what had happened and what she looked
like. I had never seen a picture of my dead granny until my parents showed
me. And it was the old lady.</B>

<BR><B>My grandmother's House</B>
<BR><B>JamiesMyBrat@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>My grandmother and grandfather bought their first house in Sacramento,&nbsp;
CA in the early 70's. When they were in the process of buying the house
the relator told them that a 15 year old girl had fallen down the steps
to the basement and broke her neck. He did not tell them that he thought
that the house was haunted, he just wanted to let them know to keep their
kids away from the basement. Things started to happen about a week after
they moved in. The previous owners (whose daughter fell down the stairs)
left their piano. At night the piano would actually play by itself. My
grandmother had told people that when she would get up to see who was playing
it she could see no one their. But she said that she could see the keys
of the piano actually moving. A week later they gave the piano away.</B>

<P><B>After the piano incident my grandmother and aunts, uncles and my
dad would all hear a little girl calling for her Mom. The only one who
went to see where the voice was coming from was my grandmother. When she
would get to the back room of the house the voice would stop calling. Eventually,
everyone just started to ignore it.</B>

<P><B>Now from what I have been told, things got a lot worse 3 months into
the moving in. At night when everyone was asleep my aunt Wendy would wake
up because she felt something was pulling her hair. She and my dad both
slept in the room that was in the back of the house and my grandma and
grandpa slept in the room at the front of the house. My aunt would run
as fast as she could to my grandmothers room and even when she was running
down the hall her hair was still being pulled by something. She was too
afraid to look back.&nbsp; When she reached my grandmothers room the thing
would stop pulling her hair. This continued for several weeks. Finally
the thing stopped pulling my aunt's hair and moved to my Dad. He would
wake up and there would be something pulling his hair and he would run
to my grandmothers room. He told me that he finally got the nerve to look
back and he wished he didn't. He said that he saw a very tall thing with
red eyes and big sharp teeth with long finger nails and long, long black
hair covering</B>
<BR><B>He told my grandmother what he saw and she got a priest to come
over and bless the house. When the house was blessed the priest poured
Holy Water into a hole that was in one of the floor boards of the kitchen
because my Dad told my grandmother that for some reason he knew the thing
lived under the floor boards. When the Holy Water was poured into the hole
my grandmother said that she swore she heard a sort of sizzling and then
the thought she heard a growl or a scream. After the blessing the thing
still pulled my aunt's and Dad's hair but it eventually went away.</B>

<P><B>The blessing did not stop all of the activity. The girl still called
for her Mom. One night my aunt Wendy woke up to find the figure of a girl
standing at the foot of her bed. When my aunt screamed the figure vanished.</B>

<P><B>As the years went by the activity of the house continued. In fact,
it never totally went away. I have been told by my uncles that they continued
to see an old man who would tell them to leave the house. They said that
he always appeared in the bathroom. Eventually everyone just learned to
live with everything that was happening.</B>

<P><B>Now flash forward to the early 90's. I am ten years old and my grandmother
has passed away. My father went back to live in the house after my parents
got a divorce. He continued to see things and tell me about them. After
all of the story's of the activity I only saw one thing. It was almost
bedtime and the door to my Dad's room was opened. I thought that I had
seen my aunt Sharon walking down the hall wearing a black hairy cloak.
I asked everyone if my aunt Sharon was visiting but I was told that she
was never there.</B>

<P><B>Since then my grandfather died and the house was lost due to repair.
A new family now own the house and I wonder if they ever see or experience
activity in the house. I will probably never get the nerve to go up to
the house and ask them.</B>

<BR><B>My ghostly savior</B>
<BR><B>RJFleming@West.com</B>

<P><B>I have been reading the stories on this page for about a week and
a half now and have shared one of my own.&nbsp; I have another that has
just started to reoccur.&nbsp; I am a security guard at a large corporation
based in Omaha, however I grew up in a small town about 35 miles away.&nbsp;
When I was in 6th or 7th grade, these occurrences started happening.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;First, a little background info.&nbsp; I first met this spirit
briefly on the day he died.&nbsp; He was a homeless man in his late twenties
or early thirties.&nbsp; One evening around dinner time, he knocked on
the front door to our house asking for money for food.&nbsp; Since we were
getting ready for dinner, my parents decided to invite him to join us for
a home cooked meal.&nbsp; He sat down and started telling us how he came
to our town on a train and was staying by the tracks that were nearby.&nbsp;
After eating and warming up for awhile, the man left with my extra sleeping
bag and some money that we had given him.&nbsp; It turns out, about an
hour after leaving our house, the man was killed by a car that was trying
to beat a train.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;Now, to the spirit part.&nbsp; About two or three days later,
my friend Shane and I were downstairs in my room playing with my stereo.&nbsp;
We heard a tap on the window so I opened the curtain to see the glowing
figure of the man we had fed just a couple days ago.&nbsp; I couldn't hear
him but I could read his lips as he said "thank you" and disappeared.&nbsp;
When I went outside to inspect the area outside my window, my sleeping
bag that I had given him was sitting outside my window.&nbsp; A few days
after visiting me, my dad asked me and my mother who put $18 under his
wallet.&nbsp; We both replied that neither of us had.&nbsp; He then turned
white and stated that it must've been the homeless man we'd met the other
day.&nbsp; My mom and I both explained our visits from the homeless man
at that point and I showed them my sleeping bag.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;This incident took place almost ten years ago and to this
day I'll catch a glimpse of what appears to be this man just watching me.&nbsp;
I've never really thought much about it until recently.&nbsp; I had never
told anyone about this incident until the other day when my roommate stopped
by my work.&nbsp; As we were talking, this spirit appeared.&nbsp; My roommate
told me to watch my back because that man over there was the same guy that's
been around our apartment for the last few days.&nbsp; I turned in the
direction that he pointed to see the man that we helped out nearly ten
years ago.&nbsp; I explained the story to him and kind of blew it off.&nbsp;
Tonight, however, I am extremely grateful to this spirit.&nbsp; As I was
getting ready to cross the street on one of my patrols, I heard a voice
tell me to "watch out."&nbsp; I stopped briefly to see who said that and
then continued.&nbsp; The voice repeated itself and then something shoved
me back away from the street hard enough to knock me to the ground just
as a garbage truck came speeding by without its headlights on.&nbsp; It
cut over the curb I was standing on seconds before.&nbsp; As I looked up,
I saw the figure of that same man that we fed so long ago standing over
me.&nbsp; I thanked the spirit for saving me.&nbsp; At that time, he looked
down at me and mouthed the words "It was the least I could do" and then
disappeared.&nbsp; I know it sounds like bs and I wouldn't even believe
it if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes.</B>

<BR><B>My ghost story</B>
<BR><B>gg@blueyonder.co.uk</B>

<P><B>hi I’m Hannah I’m 16 years and i have seen some seriously disturbing
things in my life i can defiantly say I believe in ghosts i have seen them
my whole life but have been too scared to tell any one, seeing ghost is
common thing in my family, my nan used to see ghost when she was a young
gal, and so did my mum, she used to get attracted by them, they used to
rock her bed violently until she was on the floor between the beds side
and the wall and they pushed the bed into her. I can always sense ghosts
and I can see them when they want to be seen and they call me sometimes.
I remember when I moved into my new house a little gal in a white dress
with brown curly hair used to stand in the corner staring at me crying
every night, I was so scared I never new what to do but she has now gone.
I was chased in my house buy a little boy he chased me down stairs and
just stood behind me at all time i burst out crying i was so frighten I
ran to my room and locked my door he didn’t come in my room he just stood
out side he finally left me alone but i still see him some times in the
house. I don’t know why but I always receive information from the ghost
they try to talk to me and sometimes I hear them i can feel what they are
feeling when they are close to me. one night I was at a sleep over for
my friend Kristy’s birthday and her grandad who past away came to visit
her. we were all sitting down and i could feel his presence I told Kristy
that some one in her family who had pasted away was in the room with us,
I told her I had a strong feeling from behind me, she looked behind me
and there was a picture of her grandad in a frame. Her grandads presence
told me to walk to the dinning table sit in the end chair and tell her
that this was where he used to sit when he came round for dinner to prove
that he was really there, I did it and the curtains on the windows from
behind where I was sitting fell down, Kristy cry told me I was right and
I stopped telling her anything else. Once for an week every night in my
house a group of gal ghosts used to call me they were scared of something
but because im afraid of the dark I was too scared to talk to them so I
asked them to stop calling me and they then went away, I would have tried
to help them but with it being night time and it was so dark I couldn’t
i was way too scared, that is only a few things i have seen and done there
are a lot more scary, mysterious things that happen to me, this is no joke
i feel, see, talk to ghosts all the time and a lot more strange things
happen to me. if any ghost is haunting you and you want it to go away strongly
tell it to leave and it will. please believe my story i swear i am telling
the truth, but if you don’t believe me well that’s your beliefs</B>

<BR><B>Ghost stories</B>
<BR><B>nicolam1980@yahoo.com</B>

<P><B>I have been reading your pages for a couple of years now, and I thought
that I would e-mail you with a few of my own experiences.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; when I was about 16 (I'm
22 now)I used to babysit regular for my aunt. Her house was always creepy
but I didn't experience anything major until I&nbsp; had babysat for a
few months. One evening she had went out as usual, but still hadn't returned
by the early hours so her husband suggested that myself and my cousins
just go to bed anyway, as we had school the next day. I was sleeping in
a guest bedroom on my own, facing my cousins bedroom, with my aunts room
in between. The spooky thing was that none of the bedrooms had any doors,
this used to creep me out the most. Anyway I eventually dozed of to sleep.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had
been asleep for what seemed like seconds when I was woken by the noise
of her dog going mad, barking and growling and running about downstairs.
Then all of a sudden the passageway lights were turned on, I assumed that
my aunt had returned from her night out, so I sat up in bed. As I did so
I saw a hazy figure that was the same shape and build as my aunt, I didn't
think this was out of the ordinary as my eyes had not adjusted to the light
properly yet. Just as the figure disappeared my uncle stumbled out of the
room and asked me; did you just turn on the lights? I answered no. With
that he just shrugged, in a kind of half asleep daze, turned off the lights
and returned to bed leaving me petrified in the darkness.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Anyway I managed to put this occurrence to the back of my mind and continued
to babysit. The next occurrence happened around Christmas time. This time
I was babysitting with a friend, we were just sitting talking when all
of a sudden I heard a high-pitched whistle echo all through the house.
True this wasn't really scary, just weird.</B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The next occurrence happened at an ex-boyfriends house the next year. He
was always telling me his flat was haunted, I didn't really take that much
notice of his stories. He told me about a red eyed ghost that would float
above his bed, but I thought he was just doing it to freak me out. Well
one evening we sitting talking with the lights low when he stares really
intently behind me and says &amp;#34;nici don't look at it, ignore it and
it will go away; I started to laugh thinking he was joking, but the look
in his eyes told me he wasn't. He then really starts freaking out, trying
to climb out the windows and shouting; oh my god , I've got to get out;.
He then seeing how upset I was walked right through where this thing had
been standing and opened the front door to let me out. Once we were outside
all I heard was banging and crashing from inside this now empty flat.</B>
<BR><B>I must stress that all this time I didn't actually see anything
although he swears this black shadow metamorphasized into a demonic dog-like
creature with red eyes and it was standing in the doorway. I should have
known something was wrong with that house as a few weeks earlier me and
friend had been sitting in his house while he slept off a cold. we were
talking when all of a sudden the telephone table that was attached to the
wall suddenly flew about six foot from the wall and hit my friend on the
head. She was a</B>
<BR><B>little stunned but we weren't classing this as a supernatural event,
we were too busy laughing. We hunted out a screwdriver and set about fixing
this thing to the wall. Another half hour later the same thing happened
again, at the time we thought it just wasn't fixed into the wall securely
(even though when we did it ourselves it seemed solid enough) but thinking
back it may well have been the spirit playing games.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well hope you enjoyed the true stories,
I'll write in with some other experiences soon.</B>

<P><B>In the current house we live in I have had my share of experiences
such as the above, only more physical you could say...making physical contact
with me once, alerting me of his/her presence. Mind you we bought the townhome
before anyone else lived there...they were just built. Anyway, my first
experience happened a couple years ago. My grandma who lived in Georgia
had been very ill in a nursing home for some time. Memorial Day weekend
my mother had called with the news that she had passed away. I can't remember
why now, but there was a reason that I couldn't make the trip back home
to Georgia to be at the funeral and I was devastated. I spent a good part
of that day in bed, sad that she was gone and that I did not have a chance
to say goodbye to her. My husband went to work (he works the 2nd shift
from 3-11 P.M.).&nbsp; My oldest and I decided that we would go out for
dinner that night seeing as Daddy wasn't home. So around 5:00 I turned
off the lights in the house, grabbed my purse, keys and we left coming
toward my room, feet shuffling on the carpet. Very distinctive, with no
mistaking what the sound was. I sat bolt upright and looked into the hallway.
Nothing.&nbsp; I wanted to be sure that I was truly awake before I woke
my husband. The shuffling continued, slow and methodical, getting closer
but I still saw nothing. I was very scared and shook him awake so hard
that he actually got mad. As soon as I told him "Someone's in the F'ing
house!" the sound stopped. I think it was her but I'm not sure...I haven't
head that since... That night it never occured to me that it could have
been Grandma Josephine in her slippers checking up on me again. She had
Lupus and her feet were arthritic, so....she shuffled and walked with a
cane.</B>

<BR><B>A Hair Raising Tale</B>
<BR><B>mnchick234@yahoo.com</B>

<P><B>My last story is where my ghost made physical contact with me. I
was standing at the kitchen sink, the dead of winter here in Minnesota.
My husband was outside with my oldest son. I was 6 months pregnant at the
time. My hair was very long...past my shoulders. I had just turned my back
(my kitchen is set up so that if you're facing the sink, your back is to
the dining room and breakfast counter, you can't see anything behind you.)
I felt like I was being watched but was not uncomfortable...none of our
ghosts ever scared me(Save for when I heard the footsteps) really. Anway,
my back is turned and all of a sudden, I felt a gentle breeze behind me
blowing my hair and suddenly, very gently, a long piece of my hair was
lifted straight up...like fingers had lifted it off of my back. It was
then set back down very gently. The touch and the way it was lifted was
almost lovingly, not meant to hurt or frighten me. So...those are my experiences.

<BR><B>My first sighting</B>
<BR><B>thaddius13@hotmail.com</B>

<P><B>Hi.&nbsp; First I want to say what a great website this is.&nbsp;
It's nice to read of others who can sense spirits...It's easy to feel rather
isolated when you know your "gift" is seen as a bit weird.&nbsp; Even since
I was very young I’ve been able to sense emotions.&nbsp; I like to think
of it as picking up on a location’s memories.&nbsp; But until 2 days ago,
I've never actually seen a ghost.</B>

<P><B>I've been looking for an apartment for a few months now.&nbsp; I
saw a new add in&nbsp; the paper and decided to check it out.&nbsp; The
price was GREAT (all utilities included, including central air!!) and the
apartment was in a cool neighborhood.&nbsp; I called the owner and made
an appointment to see it right away because if it was as nice as the add
said, it would go fast!&nbsp; I was also skeptical though.&nbsp; The price
was TOO good, and now I know why!!</B>

<P><B>When I pulled up in front of the building (an old house converted
into a&nbsp; 2-flat), I made up my mind to take it.&nbsp; The building
was in great shape.&nbsp; It was evident that the owner took good care
of it.</B>

<P><B>The apartment was on the second floor and attic.&nbsp; When the owner
showed up and let me in, she said that they had recently remodeled, the
apt. was&nbsp; really nice, etc.&nbsp; But I was starting to have doubts.&nbsp;
A really creepy feeling came over me.&nbsp; Not like I was being watched
or anything, just a feeling of a presence.&nbsp; As I climbed the steps,
the feeling got stronger and stronger.&nbsp; I think even the owner felt
it as well, since she started to get really nervous.&nbsp; By the time
we got to the top of the steps and went into the apt, the feeling of presence
became very oppressive.&nbsp; That's all I felt on that floor...just a
presence.</B>

<P><B>The apt. was as nice as the owner had said, though.&nbsp; It was
huge and completely remodeled.&nbsp; The main floor had a kitchen, dining
room and living room.&nbsp; The attic had two big rooms with enough space
for a home office and bedroom.&nbsp; The bathroom was also up there.</B>

<P><B>As we walked up to the attic, I felt some very powerful negative
emotions--anger, hate, despair.&nbsp; I realized that they weren't directed
at us, but inward.&nbsp; (Sorry, it's hard to explain.)</B>

<P><B>We reached the top of the steps (the office area) and stood talking
for a few moments.&nbsp; I just had to ask if anything unusual had happened
here.&nbsp; I've only felt such strong emotions at sites where I KNOW something
happened.&nbsp; I knew I hit a nerve because the owner got shifty-eyed
and didn't really answer my question.&nbsp; She said "Nothing any more
unusual than happens in any college town." or something like that.</B>

<P><B>Anyway, she moved to open the bedroom door as she was answering my
question.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; It opened out toward us, so as she opened it we both had
to step back.&nbsp; I was looking at her as she was talking, and she was
sort of behind the door as it opened.</B>

<P><B>As the door cracked opened, I felt freezing cold air roll out.&nbsp;
I was wearing shorts and sandals, so felt the cold move over my legs and
feet.&nbsp; I was also hit by INTENSE emotion.&nbsp; Much MUCH stronger
than anything I've ever experienced before.&nbsp; Despair, anger, self-hatred,
a sense of futility.&nbsp; All the hair on my arms and back of neck stood
on end.&nbsp; I KNOW the owner felt something too, because we were still
looking at each other, and I'm sure my expression was very similar to hers.&nbsp;
TOTALLY CREEPED OUT!&nbsp; She jerked the door open the rest of the way,
and RIGHT THERE IN FRONT OF US was a man hanging by a noose.&nbsp; Plain
as day!!!!!&nbsp; We both stepped back from the doorway (she gasped and
I said something that I can't say here :-) ), and the DOOR SLAMMED SHUT
IN OUR FACES!</B>

<P><B>Let me tell you, we both hightailed it out of that place.&nbsp; When
we were out on the front lawn, that's when I got the story.&nbsp; No one
would stay in that apt. for more than a few weeks.&nbsp; The owner decided
to renovate to "sweeten the pot" and try to get people to live there longer.&nbsp;
Also, the people on the first floor were long-time residents.&nbsp; When
they moved in, they complained of noises from upstairs (footsteps, loud
bangs, etc) even when the upstairs apartment was vacant.&nbsp; They eventually
stopped complaining because no one could find anything, even the police.&nbsp;
She also said that she didn't like showing that apartment because it always
felt "creepy."&nbsp; We talked for quite a while.&nbsp; I told her of my
"ability" (which I think creeped her out even more!), and told her that
the spirit needs closure.&nbsp; After she said "well, DUH!" she said that
she would check with her priest.</B>

<P><B>Needless to say, I'm NOT going to live there.&nbsp; And I can't really
say that I'm too happy about seeing my first ghost.&nbsp; But I did learn
an important lesson...the difference between a "residual" haunting and
a "true" haunting!</B>

<BR><B>My first experience...</B>
<BR><B>ZageSpArk6@aol.com</B>

<P><B>All through my childhood i lived in an almost 200 year old Victorian
house in a small Pennsylvania town. Two of the previous owners had died
in the house, peacefully we believe. My room and my sister's were the two
rooms where the owners had passed away. Our rooms were connected by a back
passage, separate than the main hallway. We both constantly heard people
walking, and the handles on the doors would turn. One night I saw a dark
figure walk along one of my walls. I know it could not have been a car
passing the house since my bedroom had one tiny window away from the street.&nbsp;
I was only about 8, but remember feeling very strange. I hid under my covers
until i fell asleep. My sister and i had to do that on many occasions just
to get through the night.&nbsp; But it was strange since we lived in that
house for 9 years, and my parents never saw or heard anything.</B>

<BR><B>wormdude66@netscape.net</B>

<P><B>I have always had a real interest in ghosts, but never truly believed
in them that was until</B>
<BR><B>I was stationed at the Atsugi Naval Base in Japan, about nine years
ago.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; I had a flight to the Island of Iwo Jima one day.&nbsp; If
you don't know the history of Iwo Jima, it had the most casualties in World
War II. I always loved going there, being a real history buff and all..until
this one day. I always went out cave hunting, looking for artifacts from
the war. I've found spent shells and military boots, etc.&nbsp; There are
a lot of bodies that were never recovered, due to the amount of caves on
this small island.&nbsp; On this one particular flight, I was just too
exhausted to do anything.&nbsp; All I could think about was getting a few
winks of shut eye when we landed. So when I arrived at the air terminal,
I found a nice couch and fell asleep instantly. I was awoken by someone
shaking me.&nbsp; I looked around but no one was there. I figured it was
one of my friends playing a joke on me, so I closed my eyes and pretended
to sleep. I stayed still for a good ten minutes when I was shook again.
I jumped up expecting to scare who ever was shaking me, but when I looked
around and no one was there. One of the Japanese military who was working
at the terminal came over and asked me what was wrong.&nbsp; I was really
shook up and explained to him what had happened. He just nodded his head,
smiled and then told me it happens all the time.&nbsp; I am very interested
in hearing from anyone who has also had any strange experiences at this
location or anywhere in Iwo Jima, Japan.</B>

<BR><B>My encounter</B>
<BR><B>rpfountz@earthlink.net</B>

<P><B>Your site is informative and very interesting. I felt compelled to
share an experience I've had. Here it is.</B>

<P><B>About 15 years ago I had an experience that I will not forget. I
feel I should be generic about the place to protect the interests of those
involved. At the time I worked for a state parks department as a temporary
summer laborer. Part of my duties was to once a week mow the lawn and check
over a roughly 150 year old plantation home that the state had acquired
as a historical home. The house was in rough shape and the consideration
for restoration was still in government "Red Tape". But being that it was
now park property, it had to be maintained. The house is off the beaten
path and was a favorite for younger people to sneak into at night and "Party".
So we had to occasionally go inside and check and clean the place up and
repair the broken locks. The house is nestled against a hillside along
the train tracks. The family graveyard is nearby. The earliest grave dating
1821. There is a nearby dwelling carved from the native stone that I assume
was used while the house was being built that clearly predates the house.
The house is an interesting layout, from the root cellar to the attic,
with 2 hidden passages that we stumbled on while cleaning up beer bottles
and such. This particular day I was checking the padlocks on the rear doors
of the house while the crew was loading up the mowers. I was starting down
the flagstone steps by the outhouse at the rear of the building heading
to the front of the building when I had my encounter. It was approximately
4 pm. I started down the steps, I saw someone at the rear door just outside
the porch at the flagstone patio. Knowing noone was supposed to be there
I stopped to see who it was. I called out, "Excuse me, can I help you?"
She was a woman, about 5 feet 5 inches tall, wearing what I think is called
a sun dress with pink and blue flower prints on it. She looked as tangible
as this computer monitor in front of me now. She was kneeling down as if
to pick something up off the marble flagstones. It may have just been coincidence
but when I called out to her, she stood to face me. Then turned, and vanished
through the porch screen door, then through the locked rear door of the
house. I was frightened at what I saw of course and ran around down the
steps to the front of the building to where my co-workers were loading
the mowers into the truck. They saw me running to the truck and stopped
me to see what was wrong with me. After a few minutes to settle my nerves
and catch my breath I told them the story. They both laughed at me and
told me I was losing my mind. Well I endured my shock and their ridicule
all the way back to the park shop. I asked them to say nothing to the other
workers or the Ranger or superintendent. But of course, the moment we enter
the office they begin to laugh and tell the officials about what I told
them. The Ranger was the first one to respond. He looked at me and asked
me what I saw. I told him and the superintendent looked up from his desk
and walked back into the records room. He came back after a few minutes
with a big file folder. Half testing me, he asked me to tell him if anyone
in the pictures he was about to show me looked familiar. The third picture,
the girl I had seen was in it. I identified her right away. The superintendent
told me it's ok. We've all seen her.&nbsp; About this time the permanent
park crew came in the office, looked at the picture on the desk, looked
and me and said, "Oh you saw her..". I felt even more faint at that point
having been shown it was not my imagination. By the way, the other 2 guys
in my crew, weren't laughing anymore. The superintendent and the ranger
told me a few stories about their experiences in the house. But I think
those would be for them to share. But suffice it to say, my experience
was mild, compared to theirs.</B>

<BR><B>My Dad</B>
<BR><B>reia.alex@xtra.co.nz</B>

<P><B>Hello, Id like to tell you of an experience I had just over two years
ago. My dad was 42 years old when he passed away suddenly from a heart
attack (young I know). And it was the night of his burial when this took
place. After the days events had passed, I kissed my mother goodnight and
made my way home. I walked to my front door, put the key in the lock as
per usual and *tried* to enter my house, however the door, seemed to be
stuck after much persuading, ( and a few choice words ) the door swung
open with ease "odd" I thought as I walked into the house ( that has never
happened before ) My two children were tired and cranky, So I made a batch
of warm chocolates and began to tuck them into bed. Before she dozed off
my daughter (then aged 4 ) said to me "Mummy, koko looks sad". Koko was
the name my daughter called my father, "It's ok I soothed my daughter koko
is fine now". I bit shaken I made myself a coffee, changed into my nightwear
and sat in bed reading a book. at Some point I fell asleep, I was awoken
again by the strangest feeling I ever had in my life!, even now it is hard
to explain. I was being shaken, I could feel the pressure of "something"
on my back but the actual shaking seemed to come from inside my back (
I told you it was weird ). I opened my eyes and was about to turn around
when I had a terrible feeling, something was behind me, and I was too afraid
to ask what, I heard breathing, it sounded strained and laboured, then
I could feel the breath on my back, I shuffled lower into my bed sheets
hoping that what ever it was would think it was in the wrong place and
leave. It was then I heard a voice as soft as a whisper but clear nonetheless
" Baby???, it said are you awake?, I kind of shivered, that was my dads
voice Id know it anywhere. "YES!!!" I wanted to scream I'm awake!!! but
my lips fell silent, instead I just kind of nodded my head and whimpered.
( big chicken I know). And then all of a sudden my eyes kind of twitched
and I was lying in my bed but my room was bright yellow.. I sat up and
stared around, at this point I wasn't sure if I fell asleep again or if
I was heading off to the spirit in the sky having been scared to death
or something, and then it happened, my dad strolled right into the room,
I wasn't scared and he was wearing his usual big toothy grin that I always
loved, he sat down beside me and asked me " why are you sad?", I looked
at him, he was still smiling but a look of concern was on his face also,
and then I was visited by a strange notion, "oh my god" I thought, "he
doesn't know". I had heard of this happening to "lost souls" and such but
I had never ever seen it before. A multitude of things went through my
mind, I thought to myself, "today I buried my father, and now he's a lost
soul, I have the opportunity here to have him around a little bit longer?.....but
I couldn't do that. So I said in my calmest voice, Dad I am sad because
you have.... have passed on. " Dads face looked ashen, then he smiled at
me, and was gone just like that, I was still in my bed, (the room had gone
back to it's original state) and I just sat there not knowing what to do,
so like any normal rational level headed adult would do in a situation
like this, I rang my mother. It was 4am and I knew mum wouldn't approve
of being woken at such an hour, but I did it anyway, surprisingly mum answered
the phone on the first ring, I was about to barrage her with a million
and one questions when she said " I know dear, he's been here already,
he told me, now go back to sleep". All I could say was "oh, okay then mum
goodnight" I slept easy that night, no shakings no heavy breathing, just
a restful sleep. The next day I went to see mum ( she's had paranormal
experiences quite often ) I asked her what did it all mean, she told me
dad thought he wasn't gone, and couldn't understand why no one would talk
to him. she said that dad told her that I had told him he had since passed
and he was just calling in to say goodbye. I also asked her why he had
to wake me the way he did, my reply was a loud "HAHAHA" I looked curiously
at mum and she told me that I sleep like a log in dense forest and even
at the best of times I'm almost impossible to wake. I like to think now
that dad is in a happy place, a place with no heartaches and no sorrows,
I have since had a few dreams about dad but nothing like that night. But
ever now and then I hear a voice in my head that says things like, "it's
gonna be fine baby", or " Don't do that baby". But those are other stories
altogether.</B>
<BR><B>I'd like to take this opportunity to thank you for giving me a chance
to get this out, I didn't realise it was so long ( my apologies).</B>

she should come to see Mom soon because every illness sets Mom back farther.

<BR><B>Old lady</B>
<BR><B>LEMacD69@aol.com</B>

<P><B>In our family, we don't talk about ghosts except to say we don't
believe in them.&nbsp; That is, we SAY we don't believe in them, but that
is just avoidance.</B>

<P><B>I remember when I was little, I was at my aunt's house for a visit.&nbsp;
In her neighborhood, houses are pressed almost right up to each other.&nbsp;
I could play in the front yard of my aunt's house and see into the neighbor's
house through the window.&nbsp; That house happened to belong to my aunt's
cousin (my dad's cousin).&nbsp; These houses were passed down through the
family.&nbsp; Anyhoo.</B>

<P><B>One day when I was playing out in the front yard, I remember looking
up and seeing an old lady looking out the window at us, kind of scowling
like we were disturbing her or something.&nbsp; I didn't think anything
of it.&nbsp; I was always meeting old people that were family.&nbsp; It
seemed like every time we got together with relatives there was a new old
person I had to meet and kiss hello.&nbsp; I went into my aunt's house
upset because I hated getting yelled at by anyone ( I was a wussy kid!)
but my parents wouldn't believe me when I said an old lady next door yelled
at me.&nbsp; They said I must have seen my cousin's wife because no old
lady lived there.&nbsp; An explanation and we moved on with our lives.</B>

<P><B>Fast forward to a couple years ago.&nbsp; I was chatting with my
mom about these relatives who still live in this house.&nbsp; She told
me that the cousin doesn't like to talk about this topic, but that house
was haunted.&nbsp; They had seen something a couple of times while they
slept, nothing threatening, just there.&nbsp; Once, the cousin remembers
getting up in the middle of the night for a drink of water and passed his
infant daughter's crib and noticed her blankets were off her.&nbsp; He
made a mental note to recover her when he returned to bed.&nbsp; When he
came back through, the blankets were neatly tucked around the baby, as
though someone did it for him.&nbsp; When he got to bed, his wife was sleeping
soundly.&nbsp;&nbsp; On another occasions, toys got picked up.&nbsp; Someone
was constantly trying to keep the place neat for them.</B>

<P><B>My mom tells me that the cousin believes that the ghost is his grandfather's
second wife.&nbsp; She was a bitter old woman who didn't like kids and
yelled at them any chance she got.&nbsp; The cousin's grandfather died
before she did and she never got along well with the relatives for the
rest of her life.&nbsp; The general belief about her ghost is that she
is trying to amend this by watching out for them and trying to be generally
helpful if she can.</B>

<P><B>I recall saying to my mom, "Oh, I know what old lady you're talking
about.&nbsp; I remember her looking out the window at me when I was little
and playing in auntie's yard."&nbsp; My mom said, "That is impossible.&nbsp;
She was dead long before you were born.&nbsp; It must have been someone
else."&nbsp; I suppose that is always possible, but something tells me
it was the ghost because I KNOW it was an old lady that scowled at me.</B>

<BR><B>Oak Alley Plantation</B>
<BR><B>Anonymous</B>

<P><B>I enjoy your site very much and visit often.&nbsp; I noticed you've
listed the Oak Alley Plantation on your famous hauntings page.&nbsp; Until
I visited this site I didn't realize the plantation was "officially" haunted.&nbsp;
No one said anything about ghosts during my visit there.&nbsp; I wanted
to share my experience at Oak Alley.&nbsp; My friend and I took a two week
road trip from our home town in northern California to New Orleans in the
winter of 1998. When we arrived in New Orleans we got into a minor car
accident.&nbsp; Long story short, the car wouldn't be fixed for two weeks
and we had to stay in Louisiana a little longer than planned.&nbsp; So
we amused ourselves by seeing the city, taking in the sites.&nbsp; We took
a really great night tour of the French Quarter highlighting all the allegedly
haunted locations (including the Lalaurie House, that was the scariest
story I've heard to date).&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, we decided we wanted to
tour a plantation before we left.&nbsp;&nbsp; We chose Oak Alley because
I wanted to see where they had filmed "Interview with a Vampire".&nbsp;&nbsp;
My friend and I took a tour bus to Vacherie down an old dirt road in a
very remote area and suddenly here's this huge house with glorious 300
year old oak trees out front.&nbsp; In the daytime, in the dead of winter,
there was a sadness about the place I cannot describe.&nbsp; As soon as
the tour started inside the house I felt as though we were being watched.&nbsp;
I got the impression that this presence felt continually trespassed upon
and resented all the people coming through the house.&nbsp; I sensed more
than one entity but there was one that was particularly strong.&nbsp; On
the second floor this feeling was even stronger (probably because we were
going into the bedrooms).&nbsp; In the master bedroom I felt the distinct
presence of a woman in black (I later learned that she is commonly seen).&nbsp;
That is where I began to feel faint and dizzy.&nbsp; This feeling grew
stronger as we exited the bedroom onto the widows walk and went around
to the east facing side over looking a garden.&nbsp; The tour had gone
ahead and at this point I could hardly walk, I was holding myself up by
the railing.&nbsp; I felt like I was going to pass&nbsp; out (which has
never happened to me) or be sick, or both.&nbsp; I looked over at my friend
and her face was literally green, but she wasn't feeling what I was feeling.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I struggled back down to the first floor and gradually felt better as we
left the house.&nbsp; I knew the reaction I had on the widow's walk was
to do with the presence I felt.&nbsp; I couldn't eat anything the rest
of the day.&nbsp; I also picked up impressions of slaves being tortured
and killed on the south east end of the property.&nbsp; It was validating
to know that other people have had experiences there as well.&nbsp; I hadn't
thought about that day until I stumbled onto your site.&nbsp; If any one
else has had an experience at the plantation I would like to hear about
it.&nbsp; Something about the energy in Louisana, so much death and turmoil
in it's past.&nbsp; Thanks for letting me share.</B>

<BR><B>That Old House</B>
<BR><B>churchiejenn@yahoo.com</B>

<P><B>Hello. I am 36 years old and have had quite a few experiences. I
am not sure what to make of them and have never really talked about them,
but would like to get some input.</B>

<P><B>First, let me give you some background information. My mother died
when I was 2 months old. She was just 20 years old and died from a rare
aggressive cancer. I have a sister who is 4 years older than me. My father
remarried (I am not sure how old I was when this happened), and I have
2 younger half-brothers. When my father remarried, they bought an old 4-story
house in Folcroft, PA. This is where the story begins.....</B>

<P><B>I do not remember moving into the house (I am not even sure how old
I was when this happened). My memories of this house begin approximately
around 2nd grade.</B>

<P><B>It was an old house, with a large wrap around front porch and double
doors. There was also a side door and a back door. And 2 different staircases.
If you went in the front double doors, to your right, there was a set of
steps that went all the way up to the 3rd floor (up, platform, up, platform,
up, platform), so that you could stand at the bottom and look up to the
3rd floor. The 2nd staircase was as soon as you walked in the side door;
the steps went directly up in front of you, only to the 2nd floor. It was
a steep set of stairs, with full walls on both sides of the steps, almost
like a tunnel. Then once you entered the side door, you would either go
straight up the steps, or take a step down to your right, into the dining
room and kitchen.</B>

<P><B>It was a very large house, with huge rooms. Sometimes, it felt almost
cavernous. I don't know how old this house is, to be honest, I never looked
into it. I kind of, don't want to know. There were2 pieces of furniture
left in this house (from the previous owners, I guess). One was an old
seat/coat rack. It was a bench (the seat of the bench lifted up), then
attached to the bench was a large mirror (at least 4 feet), and on either
side of the mirror, were hooks for coats/hats. This was a pretty large
piece of furniture and always gave me a chill.</B>

<P><B>Then there was a "sharpening stone". I am guessing at the name of
this machine, but I think I have the function correct. It was a large stone
wheel, mounted on metal and attached to what looked like part of a bike.
You would sit on the seat, push the pedals, and the stone would turn. Like
to sharpen an axe.... or something. I did not like this either. My father
kept it out on the back porch.</B>

<P><B>There was a powder room off of the kitchen (which was at the back
of the house, adjacent to the back porch). It was outside the bathroom
wall, on the porch, where this "wheel" sat. And the bathroom was constantly
infested with huge black ants, and fly’s. All year long. It used to freak
me out.</B>

<P><B>I never felt comfortable in this house. And for the 5+ years we lived
there, I did not sleep much at all.</B>

<P><B>Okay, now that you have some of the visuals.....here are my experiences.</B>

<P><B>The only room that I felt comfortable in was the 2nd floor bathroom.
I would take my pillow and blanket and go into the bathroom, curl up in
the middle of the floor and sleep.</B>

<P><B>I would always hear noises up on the third floor. Various noises....talking,
banging, walking, doors closing and opening. Nothing too loud, but loud
enough to hear it. The house had an oppressive feel to it. I can't explain...it
was just a heavy feeling.</B>

<P><B>We had approximately 10 different pets in the short time that we
lived there. ALL of them ran away. We had a Collie, a Dalmatian, a few
mutts, a cat and even something that my father called a Tasmanian Devil.
It looked like a bat's head on a dog's body, except that it had no tail.
Long snout, with long pointed teeth and very big pointy ears. This dog
would sit behind the couch in the main living room and just growl and show
his teeth. NONE of the animals would go up the main set of stairs. There
was a large room as you came in the front double doors (in between the
front door and the beginning of the steps). This was also where the coat/hat
rack resided. Well, we would go into this room, which was our play room,
and I would try to drag one of the dogs in there with me to play, and they
would look up the stairs and growl, hair on the back of their necks standing.
And when I would let their collar go, they would take off for the back
door, and cry until you let them out. Every one of these dogs, dug a hole
under the back fence and ran away.</B>

<P><B>Then I tried to carry our cat, Sebastian, up the stairs. I made it
halfway up the first set, before the first landing, and the cat practically
clawed my eyes out to get away, and leapt to the bottom of the steps, hissing
as it ran. My face, neck and arms were pretty clawed up. He did a number
on me, just to get away from the stairs.</B>

<P><B>I would sit on that first set of steps and play sometimes.&nbsp;
I would feel these rushes of cold air go past me.&nbsp; But they were very
quick. As soon as I would feel it and look up, it would be done. This only
happened on those stairs.</B>

<P><B>I would tell my sister these things, but she didn't believe me. She
was 4 years older than I was and at that time, was approx. 12 or so. She
really didn't want to be bothered. My father worked 2 jobs and my stepmother
drank alot, so it was often that I was playing in the house, pretty much
on my own.</B>

<P><B>I remember hearing whispering throughout the house. And the more
I would try to focus on what was being said, the more blurred it would
become. It was always so faint, that there were times I thought it was
just my imagination.</B>

<P><B>I was very neat and organized. I had a stepmother that drank alot,
and she did not like thing messy. So, I was careful with where I put things.
My toys would disappear from my room....small things, like a Barbie shoe.
Then reappear elsewhere in the house, like on top of the fireplace mantel,
or in the china closet inside a teacup or glass. These were places that
I couldn't even reach. And I would get in trouble for putting them there.</B>

<P><B>Finally my father and stepmother divorced and my sister and I moved
in with our grandparents. I don't specifically remember moving out of the
house, I just remember feeling calm on the first night at my grandparents.
And that was where I stayed.</B>

<P><B>Things were quiet for a number of years, until I bought my own house.
The story continues even further than that. I now have 2 children, and
my youngest son apparently sees ghosts. Some are friendly, and he talks
about them as if they were regular people. Others "poke" at him in his
bed at night, and upset him to the point of hysteria.</B>
<BR><B>This is a long first letter, and I do appreciate your listening
to me. I will follow up with the other stories........</B>

<BR><B>Now it is bothering my son</B>
<BR><B>churchiejenn@yahoo.com</B>

<P><B>Good afternoon to all. This is part 3 of what seems to be a never-ending
story.</B>

<P><B>I left off with us moving to Florida. We were in a very small town
approximately 25 miles south of Orlando. It was pretty small, it took almost
12 of the 25 miles, just to get to what would normally be called “town”.&nbsp;
Within this small development was 1 gas station, a Denny’s, a Burger King,
a small grocery store, a Pizza Hut, a Video Store and a small convenience
store (kind of like a 7-Eleven) called the Farm Store.</B>

<P><B>Now this was ALL there was for 12 miles. And we were about 1.5 miles
from this little strip of stores. We were really in the sticks.&nbsp; There
are no streetlights, except for the ones on the main strip. Once you turn
off onto any given side street, it is dark, big time.</B>

<P><B>We were renting a very nice house. Approximately 2700 square feet.
Really open &amp; spacious, 4 full size bedrooms, Kitchen, Dining room,
Family room and den, a large swimming pool, 2 car garage and a cool circular
driveway.&nbsp; Aesthetically pleasing.&nbsp; Also, there was about 1.5
acres in between our house and the other houses next to us. And there was
nothing but woods behind us.</B>

<P><B>But from the time we moved in, I didn’t sleep.&nbsp; My husband and
my oldest son, seemed perfectly at home. Not a problem or care in the world.&nbsp;
But for my youngest son, and myself, it was different.</B>

<P><B>As for myself, I just felt uneasy…uncomfortable. Even during the
daylight hours, I hated being at home alone. The nights were even worse.&nbsp;
I would stay up until 3:00 or 4:00am, until my eyes just wouldn’t stay
open any longer.&nbsp; Also, I always had pains in my chest, up in the
left shoulder region. From the time we arrived until the time we left,
I had these pains throughout the day, every day.&nbsp; I went and had all
kinds of tests done. They did several EKG’s, a stress test and even an
ultrasound of my heart and carotid arteries. All tests showed I was in
good health.</B>

<P><B>My little one was just under 2 years old when we moved to Florida.
It is hard to gauge someone this young. He couldn’t really tell me what
was going on, granted he was talking, but not in complete sentences.</B>

<P><B>But I do know this, he would look at things.&nbsp; His eyes would
follow something across the room, when nothing was there.&nbsp; I would
be playing with him and he would look up and stare at something just beyond
me. And when I would turn around, of course there was nothing there.&nbsp;
I would look back at him, and he would still be staring.&nbsp; Not a blank
stare either, his eyes would move around a bit, as if he were watching
someone or something.</B>

<P><B>He also never slept in this house.&nbsp; It was quite difficult to
get him to sleep most nights. It is not that he would cry or anything like
that, he would lay quietly, he just wouldn’t fall asleep.&nbsp; But you
couldn’t leave him alone either, or he would cry. And every night he would
wake up around 2:00 or 3:00am and end up in bed with me.</B>

<P><B>Then one night, the children were sleeping and my husband and I were
sitting on the couch watching TV when all of a sudden we heard a woman
screaming outside. We looked at each other, and took off out the garage
door and into the driveway. We keep hearing this woman screaming…no words,
just screams. He ran around the back of the house. I ran inside and turned
on all of the floodlights. While standing in the driveway, it sounded like
she was very close. Like no further than the back of the house. My husband
continued to walk around outside. I went back in through the garage, then
out into the screened area where the pool is. And with the floodlights
on, you could see a pretty good distance.&nbsp; But the screaming had stopped.&nbsp;
We found nothing.</B>

<P><B>It was quite unnerving to have heard these screams. I felt so very
uneasy.&nbsp; All I could think of was back in these thick woods, was a
woman in trouble and we couldn’t find her. So, we called the police and
they came out. They sent a few men into the woods with these huge searchlights,
but found nothing. They also went and talked to the neighbors, but the
neighbors said that they hadn’t heard a thing.&nbsp; Weird.&nbsp; So, we
checked back with the police a few days later and they said that they had
not received any missing persons report within the past week. No one could
explain what we heard.</B>

<P><B>The cops said it might have been a girlfriend and boyfriend fighting.
But, I don’t believe it.&nbsp; We were living in a remote area, backed
up to some woods and also on a cul-de-sac. So, it is not like there was
any thru-traffic. And there were no cars around with the exception of our
neighbor’s cars.&nbsp; The screaming was close to us too….it didn’t sound
like it was back in the woods or &frac12; a mile up the road, it sounded
closer than that.</B>

<P><B>On to the next experience. We did not live too far from Kennedy Space
Center (KSC). It was actually very cool the first time the Shuttle landed
at Kennedy. The sonic boom is amazing. If you have never heard or felt
this phenomenon, you should, it is awesome.</B>

<P><B>Well, the first time I heard and felt it, I was prepared because
I knew it was coming. It was all over the news that the Shuttle was scheduled
to land at around 2:00pm. So, at about 1:30 I was outside playing with
the kids and about 15 minutes later, I felt this push of air against my
whole body then these 2 loud “booms”. It was most fascinating.&nbsp; Never
having felt a sonic boom before, I wasn’t sure what to expect. But now
having experienced it, believe me when I tell you there is no mistaking
it for something else. It is unique.</B>

<P><B>So, during one of my many sleepless nights, I was sitting in the
family room watching TV, when all of a sudden I felt the house shake and
heard this loud “boom”. At first I sat there in shock. Then I jumped up
and turned on the floodlights to look outside. I honestly thought a car
had plowed into the side of the house. But there was nothing. Then I went
back and sat down, analyzing in my head, the sound that I had heard. Then
it came to me that the Shuttle must have landed. There was almost a sense
of relief, like yeah..that’s what that was.&nbsp; But, when flicking through
the channels, I caught the rerun of the 11:00pm News. So, I watched it
to get info on the Shuttle, but there was none. Now living in Florida,
I noticed that KSC was always in the news for one thing or another. And
especially during launches and landings, it was all over the news. But
on the rerun of the news that night, there was no mention of it. Odd.</B>

<P><B>So, I jumped online to see if I could find a schedule for KSC and
Shuttle activity. And on their web site, it said that there were no launches
or landings scheduled for the Shuttle at this time, please check back.</B>

<P><B>I asked my husband the next morning if he had heard it, and of course
he had not. I watched the morning edition of the news, to make sure that
something hadn’t happened overnight, that might not have been on the 11:00pm
news or the KSC web site. Again, there was no mention of a scheduled or
otherwise, Shuttle landing.</B>

<P><B>To this day, I have not been able to explain what that noise was.
But, I am positive it had the presence of a sonic boom. Just without the
presence of the Shuttle.</B>

<P><B>We moved back to PA within 4 months of that occurrence. Nothing else
had happened since then, with the exception of my son looking at things
that weren’t there.</B>

<P><B>Unfortunately, the job didn’t work out and neither did my marriage.&nbsp;
So, I moved back to PA and in with my sister until I could find a place
of my own. And that’s where the fun really begins……</B>

<P><B>Thanks again for listening. And I will continue the story with part
4 soon.</B>
<BR><B>Take care to all!</B>

<BR><B>Ghost story</B>
<BR><B>linni32@yahoo.com</B>

<P><B>I have had a few experiences of ghosts. First of all in my old house.
It is about 100 years old and is part of a terrace that was built for the
local miners:</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I never actually put all the pieces together
until just before me and my family moved out of the house.</B>
<BR><B>There was always something strange about it, but I just kept putting
things down to coincidence. We lived there since I was only three, and
I always had this strange feeling about my mother's bedroom. It was a side
door along the upstairs hall. The hall was really spooky in itself. It
was unlit, had no windows, and doors at the top and bottom. I refused to
walk down it in the dark all my life. My mother had a wicker chair in the
corner of her room that always seemed to be the focus of my fear. I was
scared to go in by myself and whenever I had to walk down the hall I would
shut my mother's bedroom door without looking inside. I don't really know
when this fear started, I just always had a bad feeling from it.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; My mother would go out to work at nights and I would be left
to babysit my younger brother. Sometimes we would be downstairs and would
hear banging and floorboards creaking above us, where the hall is. We had
two cats so I would put it down to them, but often they were downstairs
with us or outside.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; Anyway, I can't really remember very much more happening
until the year before we left. I had a musical jewelry box in my window
at the foot of the bunk-bed I shared with my younger brother. I never wound
the box up because it was really tough and it annoyed me when it sang every
time I opened it. For the few weeks before we left, at the same time every
morning, the jewelry box would play. At first I thought someone must have
knocked it, but it kept happening day after day at the exact same time
and when I checked it, it was unwound.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; After we left the house my mum finally told us of the things
she had witnessed. She said she didn't want to tell us before in case we
were scared. She said she would often be downstairs while we were at school
and she would hear banging and footsteps in the hall</B>
<BR><B>above. She said that sometimes she heard someone saying her name.
She said that sometimes she would feel the hairs raise up on her neck as
the room went cold.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; Just something to add, it might be unrelated, a coincidence,
but the man who moved into the house after us died of a heart attack a
couple of weeks later. No one has lived there since.</B>
<BR><B>My other experience was a couple of years ago at my friend's grandparents'
house. It was bonfire night and her family had invited me to the party.
Me, my friend, her sister, and her sister's friend spent most of the night
wandering around her large garden. The house was built by the family on
a large plot of land that was a field. You can't see from one side the
other in the dark, it's so large! The adults were crowded around the bonfire
at the far end of the garden, near the house, and us being teenagers were
wandering off. It got dark, and we just kept walking around talking and
such. Then my friend's sister and her friend went back to the house. Me
and my friend were stood talking at the far end of the garden. Just about
boys and such.</B>
<BR><B>Then, completely unexpectedly her face changed and she went white.
I asked her what was wrong. She told me that I wouldn't believe her, but
that she had just seen two white figures stood about 20 feet away from
her. One large one and one small one. I was dubious but I asked her to
point where. Her hand was shaking as she pointed. I asked her if she was
joking but she denied it, and didn't look like she was making it up. I
stood watching where she had pointed for about 3 minutes. She said she
had seen them in the corner of the garden, where two fences meet. On the
other side of the fences is another open field, but she said they were
on the inside of the fence. I waited, and then what I saw terrified me!
Two white figures appeared from the corner of the garden, where she had
said.</B>
<BR><B>They ran for about 5 seconds, straight across our viewpoint, and
then disappeared. My friend and I ran screaming and crying to her parents.
They didn't believe us of course. So we went a second time, this time taking
my friend's sister's friend. We waited, and again we saw the exact same
thing. And again we ran. It was so frightening! Two ghostly figures, running
straight in front of us. Being of a scientific nature, my friend and I
looked at all the possibilities of what it could be. It wasn't foggy, it
was a clear night, all the bonfire smoke was well over the other side of
the garden, there was nothing to make any light, and nothing for the light
to shine upon. Nothing could explain what we saw.</B>

<BR><B>My Story</B>
<BR><B>iamqueenbee22@hotmail.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>I have a pretty freighting story to tell. Last summer I was living
on the streets with my fianc&eacute; Troy in Irving Texas. We had a friend
named Denis and he told us about this abandoned boys home that was only
2 blocks away from his apartment that we could stay at if we had the balls.
He gave us fare warning that the place was haunted. Troy and I really didn’t
take much head to his warning. As the day went on we asked around about
the place and it turned out that everyone was totally scared of the place
and wouldn’t step foot on the property. Of course we decided that thay
were all just panzies and we decided to check it out. When we got there
it was so strange. It was in the middle of the city but toatly hidden by
a forest&nbsp; of trees. We hoped the fence and walked like a half a mile
up a trail. It was pitch dark and so hard to see more than a few feet in
front of you wich made it creepy. I forgot to tell you that Denis is guiding
the way. So he takes us to this house and the door was unlocked. We went
in to find that the place was toatly furnished. So we chose a room and
lit some of the candles that Denis had given us. We couldnt believe how
lucky we were to find a place to stay that had beds and nice soft fluffy
pillows and warm blankets. That first night was fine. We slept more comfortably
than we have in months. So the next morning when we awoke we decided to
explore. First we explored the house that we were in and it was strange
there were 9 rooms all full of furniture and cloths from like the 70's
and even family photographs of some of the boys families that stayed there.
Then we decided to explore the grounds. It was amazingly beautiful. There
was a lake and basketball court. We discovered that there are 9 houses
on the property all furnished and full of the boys and staff belongings.
It was so strange it was like they all just disappeared or just abandoned
all there belongings and left for some unknown reason. Even in the office
contained file cabinets full of records of the boys. But we decided to
stay because hell we had our own furnished house. On the second night was
not as comfortable as the first being that weird stuff began to happen.
When we went to bed we lit 7 candles cuz the place was pretty creepy. I
awoke to something falling in the middle of the night. When I opened my
eyes it was pitch dark. All 7 candles had fallen over at the same time.
I freaked out and woke up Troy and he told me to relight the candles so
I did. After that I really couldn’t sleep so I just layed there with my
eyes closed. About 10 minutes later I herd something fall again and my
eye lids went black. All the candles has fallen over again. By now I was
spooked good but we decided to stay anyways. About a week later we were
laying in bed talking when we heard the sound of one of the doors open
and then the sound of 3 teenage boys talking. They were just having a normal
conversation. So we decided that they were probably more squatters just
looking for a place to stay the night and that we would go tell them that
we have claimed this house and that ther were 8 other houses they could
use but when we walked out in the hallway the voices stopped and no one
was there. So we just went to sleep being that it was all pretty harmless.
The next night we herd heavy human footsteps on the attic but no one was
there. Then we had an encounter with a ghost turkey as odd as it sounds.
The front door was glass and Troy woke up one morning and needed to pee
but when he opened the bedroom door to go down the hall he heard a pecking
sound. So he looks tward the front door and there was a giant turkey pecking
at the glass. He calls to me ''baby come here you got to see this there’s
a giant turkey pecking at the front door.'' Of course I thought he was
full of crap cuz we are in the middle of the city but still I got up and
sure enough there it was pecking on the glass of the door. I was like whoa
and I started to walk up to the door but rite before I got there&nbsp;
the turkey disappeared rite in front of our eyes. Then that same day we
were getting ready to go out to look for jobs when I saw a shadow in the
window. When I went to look out the shades I saw a teenage boy walking
towards the house but he wasn’t getting any closer. When I called Troy
to the window to see him the guy just disappeared in front of us. Then
we had the last straw when we witnessed 4 ghosts snakes disappear in front
of us in the house with the antique workout equipment. The snakes just
appeared for like 20 seconds and disappeared. Needless to say we took that
as a sign of evil and fled and never went back. If you want a truly haunted
place to investigate this is it. It is still there to my knowledge.</B>

<BR><B>In my own home Deerfield, MI</B>
<BR><B>pci@cass.net</B>

<P><B>&nbsp;Hello! My name is Chris and I recently experienced something
that I thought, was just me, losing my mind.</B>

<P><B>First of all, I am a hairdresser ,and I was in a rush one morning
a few weeks ago to go to the beauty supply store. I was looking around
for my purse in my house and for the life of me, could not find it.&nbsp;
I know for a fact that I brought it in from my car the night before, when
I got home from shopping because I still had a large amount of cash in
it, and didn't want to be stolen. I live in a small town of about 971 people
and it's usually pretty safe to leave your doors unlocked in your vehicle
or house, and alot of the time I just leave my purse in my van on the floor
behind the driver seat , so at least it's out of sight. Anyway, this time
I chose to take it in the house.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I decided to go the supply store anyway,
and took the chance of not having a license with me. I arrived home and
again, looked and looked. I tore my house apart looking for it.&nbsp; I
looked in places I knew it wouldn't be, for the heck of it. I was pretty
desperate. I even looked in laundry baskets full of clothes, thinking one
of my kids put it in there and it got covered up. Still no luck. So I called
my bank, reported my purse missing, credit cards , etc.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I brought my stuff in from the supply store
awhile later and set it on my living room floor and started going through
it. I had a lot of new things I was excited to have gotten, so it felt
like Christmas. (LOL)...Anyway I was sitting on the floor with my legs
crossed (Indian style) and there sits my purse right smack dab next to
my&nbsp; right leg. If it were any closer and if it had teeth, it could
of bit me. My heart fell to my stomach and my hair on the back of my neck
stood up.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While I was looking for it earlier I was
talking out loud, saying "Ok, where is my purse!!! Someone please help
me!!".. I felt silly but sometimes when I do that ,I end up finding what
I'm looking for.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I KNOW for a fact that hadn't been sitting
there the whole time. If it were, I would of tripped over it as many times
I had walked by the spot I was sitting.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether or not I just didn't see it, I dont'
know, but it scared the heck out of me.</B>

<BR><B>My personal story</B>
<BR><B>mstoufflet7105@yahoo.com</B>

<P><B>I would like to know if anyone has experienced anything like what
my family and I experienced in 1977?&nbsp; Especially if anyone reading
this ever lived in or around the Gulfport, Mississippi area, and may have
heard of similar stories.</B>
<BR><B>Around 1977, I was stationed at the Gulfport Naval Construction
Center.&nbsp; Just before Christmas, my wife and I, along with my two daughters
(They were ages 4 and 2 then), moved into a new military housing area located
just north of I-10. The housing area was so new that every house in the
entire subdivision didn't even have grass yet.&nbsp; I lived on the back
row of the development with a wooded area behind me and to the side of
me.&nbsp; It was a real nice house. It was a three bed room house, and
each of us having our own room.</B>
<BR><B>There was a central hall way running down the middle and a single
bathroom off to the left.</B>
<BR><B>Everything was going great.&nbsp; This was the first house we had
lived in as a family, having lived in apartments up until then.&nbsp; It
wasn't very long before strange things started happening in the house.&nbsp;
I was usually the last person to go to bed and the first person to wake
up.&nbsp; I would leave for work and notice things were sort of moved around
a bit as if someone was picking them up and putting them back down but
not quite in same place. I would walk into the room and see the rocking
chair moving, which I attributed to the wind or other reasons. Having two
young children,</B>
<BR><B>I didn't really didn't think anything of this until later when things
started to really go wild.</B>

<P><B>My youngest daughter developed this fear sleeping in her room.&nbsp;
At first, we just thought it was because she never slept away from her
sister before. I would pick her up when she was sound asleep, place her
in her bed and wake the next morning finding her in my bed or on the couch
in the front room.&nbsp; I asked her why she wouldn't sleep in her room
she would only say that there was a monster in her room. I tried all the
tricks parents would do to get her to stay in her room.&nbsp; But like
clock work, she would fall asleep in her room, but would wake up move to
any place other than her room.&nbsp; (Years later when talking to my daughter
about this, she told me she remember some guy would come out of her closet
and just stand over her and look at her).&nbsp; My oldest daughter refused
to let her sister sleep with her because the monster would follow her into
her room. It got so bad that the girls refused to sleep.&nbsp; We started
leaving the hall light on so the girls would go to sleep and we could get
some rest.</B>
<BR><B>One night, I had to get up early and just had to get some sleep.&nbsp;
I was lying in bed when I started hearing what I thought was music.&nbsp;
I could not hear the actual notes or any words, but I could hear what I
can only describe as the vibration one would get if the sound was coming
through your walls.&nbsp; I lay in bed for what seem like hours, unable
to sleep because of the music.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;I finally got out of bed and went next door to ask my neighbor
to please turn down the music.&nbsp; As soon as I got outside, all was
quite!&nbsp; I thought to myself,</B>
<BR><B>"Good, now I can get some sleep", only to have the music start again.&nbsp;
A few weeks later my parents came and stayed the weekend.&nbsp; The next
morning I asked my Dad how he had slept.&nbsp; He stated great, except
for the radio that played most of the night.&nbsp; My wife and I laugh,
saying it was our "ghost" and explained about the music I heard a few weeks
earlier.&nbsp; My Dad stated, "Perhaps you have squirrels or other pest
in your attic".&nbsp; We went up into the attic with flash lights, but
could not find a nest of any sort.&nbsp; We eventually explained it away
by saying maybe it was a vent.</B>
<BR><B>While we explained away the "music", the nightly visit to my daughter
seemed to increase. We gave up trying to make my youngest stay in her room
and my oldest seem to need company and wanted her sister to remain.</B>
<BR><B>This seemed to anger our "guest"!&nbsp; For soon he started to pay
my wife and me a visit.</B>
<BR><B>One particular night the kids were asleep and my wife and I were
lying in bed when we both felt like some one was sitting on the end of
the bed and decided to stand up.&nbsp; We both felt the corner rise, but
again we just sort of explained it all away by saying perhaps the bed was
just caught and had picked that time to release itself.&nbsp; A few nights
later I was awaken by the most guttural moans you could imagine. Instead
of a ghost, it was my wife.&nbsp; Before I could move to wake her, she
sat right up and screamed that something had</B>
<BR><B>grabbed both her legs and was trying to pull her out of the bed.&nbsp;
We again tried to explain it away as a dream.&nbsp; Except this dream re-occurred
shortly afterwards.&nbsp; This time we were lying down talking.</B>
<BR><B>Again, she felt something grab her and start to pull her down.&nbsp;
This time I thought I saw the covers move as if an arm had reach under
the blanket. We started to notice the other things I had mention before,
the rocking chair moving and the items that were moved.</B>
<BR><B>The final straw, as they say, was when I finally got to see our
visitor.&nbsp; With all that was going on, I was usually the last to fall
asleep.&nbsp; I had gotten up once my wife was asleep and went into the
front room to watch some television.&nbsp; It was about 1:00 a.m. when
I went back to the bed room.&nbsp; I had just laid my head down on the
pillow and was reaching to remove my glasses when I saw what I could only
describe as a short man, very old looking, wearing a white sleeping shirt.&nbsp;
He was standing in my doorway grinning ear to ear. While I could see his
features and make out the smile, what was wrong was I could still see the
wall behind him.&nbsp; I yelled, "Who are you? What do you want"?&nbsp;
Out of the corner of my eye my wife stirred and I glance towards her. I
thought I imagine his smile turn to a frown.&nbsp; He just didn't disappear
as much as he just sort of faded away. I once heard people describe it
like a movie projector that was turned off and as the light faded, so did
the picture.&nbsp; Needless to say we moved shortly afterwards.&nbsp; To
this day, both my daughters remember the nightly visitor and they will
not sleep in a room with the closet doors open.&nbsp; I am still left with
doubt as to how much really happen and how much was imagined.</B>

<BR><B>My personal haunting experience</B>
<BR><B>jennalexander15@hotmail.com</B>

<P><B>Ok, I thought really hard about actually writing to you to tell you
about this, it seems like such along time ago, but I can remember every
detail.</B>
<BR><B>It still makes me feel weird.&nbsp; When I was little we lived in
a huge house right off the hi-way.&nbsp; You came down a really long lane
and the house was surrounded by trees. It had three bedrooms and a bathroom
upstairs, and down stairs was a living room, dining room, and a big kitchen.&nbsp;
Well, when I was about five I remember getting in to trouble because I
just would not stay in bed. I was always afraid to go to bed.&nbsp; I used
to line all of my stuffed animals up on the top stair step, as if they
would some how save me.&nbsp; I remember going down to the basement to
watch my grandpa put in a bathroom down there, and getting lost.&nbsp;
It was not a big basement.&nbsp; Only one big room with the steps coming
down in the middle of the room. But yet, I got lost. I remember going around
in circles and thinking this isn't right, the stairs are right here.&nbsp;
The "spell" was finally broke when my grandpa hollered down to tell me
to come up. Anyway, When I was about 6 yrs old, I remember being in bed
and hearing someone call for "MOM". My little brother was only 4 months
old.&nbsp; I new this.&nbsp; I got up out of bed and looked out my bedroom
door, which was right by the stairs. I looked at my stuffed animals all
lined up at their vigal and then looked down the stairs.&nbsp; There standing
at the bottom of the stairs, with his hand on the banister, was a little
boy dressed in a red and white striped T-shirt, blue jeans, and white shoes.&nbsp;
I can describe him to this day with perfect clarity.&nbsp; He had blond
hair and blue eyes and looked like a normal kid. My first thought was "what
was this kid doing in my house".&nbsp; Then, I yelled for MoM and he disappeared.&nbsp;
I was so scared I will never forget that feeling as long as I live.&nbsp;
I got spanked, too. No one believed me, or so I thought.&nbsp; When I was
24 I was talking to my dad, a 6'4, 250 pound biker.&nbsp; I told him about
it again.&nbsp; He said he remembered. He also said that he found out a
couple months after the incident that a little boy had died in our house.&nbsp;
He fell into a tub of lye in the basement.&nbsp; He was wearing the clothes
I described.&nbsp; It still makes me wonder what really happened but I
do know that we moved shortly after this, because my mom and dad did not
like being in the house alone. My cousin lived in the house later and said
he never heard any thing. The house has since burned down, and another
rebuilt.&nbsp; But I still wonder if the little boy is there. What do you
think? I am now 29 yrs old and still think about this.</B>

<BR><B>My personal experience</B>
<BR><B>tharonbeckley@yahoo.com</B>

<P><B>Hello. I wanted to tell you of my personal ghost experiences. I used
to live at 113 Bennett Street in Battle Creek, Michigan. Myself, along
with my two nieces, and others have seen a ghost of a little girl and a
ghost hand that appeared to be a man's hand. I've tried to find out if
anyone has ever been killed in that house but was unlucky but maybe you
can help. I know that house has been there since the 1920's. I have looked
in local pages on homes of the 20's here in Battle Creek. Now, for what
I and others have seen in this house. There is stairs that lead to the
two upper bedrooms in this house. I have seen the little girl standing
on these stairs and when my nieces were younger and still living in this
house I used to yell at the ghost thinking it was one of them. As for the
hand, we had seen that reach out at us when walking up the stairs. My Aunt
now lives in this home and she has been the owner of this home for over
20 years. Of course, she doesn't believe in ghosts and she would be that
maybe a little girl years ago was pushed down those stairs or perhaps stairs
of a house that was there before that one by a man. Also, that night that
we all seen her together we all thought maybe that was the anniversary
of her death. Like I said, I tried to find info. On any deaths that might
have happened in that house but was unsuccessful. My Aunt is the only one
who has been living in that house for the past 6 years. My Aunt lived in
that house though when I was a kid there and I used to stay there a lot
growing up but never remember seeing a ghost there when I was a kid but,
remember feeling a creepy feeling when I was upstairs in the bedrooms and
all my cousins that stayed there too agree with that. If you could find
out if there's anything that ever happened in that house as far as death,
I would appreciate it. I do have other ghost encounters but, I'll write
to you on those another time. Thank you!</B>

<P><B>My mother died 6 years ago, on September 29,1996. She was 63 and
her death was a complete surprise to all of us. We greatly miss her. On
with my story. The Mother's Day before her death my younger sister, who
was 24 at the time, gave my mother a card. It was one of those that when
you open it, it plays music. When my mother opened this card it did not
play any music much to our dismay. She still loved the card of course and
it got a place of honor on her entertainment center, standing up open.
Then in September, she became ill and died. On the day she was buried,
we were all very devastated especially my father who would have celebrated
45 years of wedded bliss in March. My father was very hard of hearing due
to an injury in WW2. After the funeral we went back to the house, as we
entered the door my father asked, "where is that music coming from?".&nbsp;
The card my sister had given my mom was playing and my near deaf dad heard
this! The card played like that for 2 weeks, no matter if we closed it
or not. Then it just stopped.&nbsp; I like to think that it was my mother
trying to comfort us in our time of need. What do you think?</B>

<P><B>I HAVE HAD A FEW UNEXPLAINABLE THINGS HAPPEN TO ME IN MY LIFE. ONE
STICKS OUT THE MOST AS IT WAS SHARED BY MORE THAN ONE PERSON. I WAS VERY
YOUNG WHEN MY GRANDFATHER DIED. I WAS 7 AND MY SISTER WAS 5, MY GRANDFATHER
HAD BEEN SICK PRETTY MUCH FOR AS LONG I REMEMBERED HIM AND MY SISTER HAD
NEVER KNOWN HIM WHEN HE WASN'T SERIOUSLY ILL. MY FATHER TOOK THE DEATH
OF HIS FATHER VERY HARD AS HE HAD BEEN A GREAT MAN.</B>

<P><B>ONE NIGHT A LITTLE WHILE AFTER HE HAD PASSED MY SISTER AND I WERE
PUT TO BED JUST LIKE ALWAYS, WE SHARED A HUGE BED AND ALWAYS FOOLED AROUND
AFTER LIGHT OUT. THAT NIGHT WE DIDN'T FOOL AROUND AND WENT RIGHT TO SLEEP.
THE NIGHT WAS VERY STRANGE AND WE BOTH SLEPT PRETTY BAD. IN THE MORNING
WE WERE BOTH VERY QUIET WHICH WAS TOTALLY NOT LIKE US IN ANY WAY. MY MOTHER
WAS WORRY AND EVENTUALLY ASKED US WHAT WAS THE MATTER WITH US. MY SISTER
JUST STARTED TO BLURT OUT THIS STORY ABOUT OUR GRANDFATHER AND HOW HE HAD
COME TO HER DREAMS AND TAKEN HER ICE SKATING. SHE SAID SHE REMEMBER JUST
HOW STRONG HE WAS AND HOW SHE HAD TO BE STRONG AND HAPPY. AT THIS POINT
I WAS A LITTLE FRIGHTENED I SAID TO MY MOTHER THAT I HAD THE SAME DREAM
AND IT WAS EXACTLY THE SAME ONLY KATE WASN'T IN IT ONLY I WAS. MY MOTHER
BEING MY MOTHER DIDN'T BELIEVE US. SHE SAID WE MUST HAVE BEEN REMEMBERING
SOME OTHER TIME WHEN WE HAD BEEN ICE SKATING AND THINKING OF OUR GRANDFATHER.
I WAS QUICK TO POINT OUT THAT I HAD NEVER ICE SKATED BEFORE AND NEIT</B>

<P><B>I WILL NEVER BE SURE WHAT HAPPENED THAT NIGHT BUT I AM HAPPY TO GO
AHEAD THINKING THAT IT WAS MY GRANFATHER SAYING HELLO AND TELLING US IT
WOULD BE OK. MY FATHER NEVER SAYS MUCH ABOUT IT BUT WE KNOWN THAT HE JUST
CAN'T FIGURE OUT HOW WE COULD DISCRIBE DOWN TO THE DETAIL A PLACE THAT
HAD NOT BEEN THERE FOR 15 YEARS BEFORE OUR BIRTHS!</B>

One night around midnight I got this feeling that somebody was in my room.
When I looked up there was a pale white figure standing at my door. Thinking
it was only a dream I hid my head under the covers and waited a little
while. When I looked up again it was still there but it had moved to my
closet door. I was so scared that I started screaming for my mom. when
she came in and turned the light on it disappeared. And ever since then

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've been living in my 3-family house for
about 2 years and in my apartment I've seen the apparition of an old woman
3 times all at night. Once she was walking down the hall, another at the
foot of my bed, and the side of my bed. They all occurred between 10:00pm
and 5:00am. She didn't scare me, but they weren't exactly a welcomed sight
in the early morning hours. The TV turns on/off, channels change; lights
turn on/off; doors open on their own; objects move on their own; cold spots;
and odd smells are all common. My mother hasn't seen the apparition, but
has experienced most of the other paranormal events, but dismissed them
until the people that live upstairs' kids had seen the same woman the parents
upstairs haven't seen the apparition either. No adult has seen her, only
myself, (14), and the people upstairs', kids (12 &amp; 14).</B>

<BR><B>Possible haunting In Sunset Beach, CA (near Seal Beach)</B>
<BR><B>webbdionfam@attbi.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>From 1989 to 1991 I worked as a performer / server at Tibbies Music
Hall (a dinner theater) in Sunset Beach, CA. It was housed in a two story
building on a pier and boat dock just off of Pacific Coast Hwy.; the theater,
bar, dressing rooms, lobby, an office and one kitchen were on the first
floor, a Reubens Steakhouse and another kitchen/office where located on
the second floor. The theater and restaurant closed in December 1991 and
was vacant for many years, although I'm sure it's probably back in use
today. It was also located across the street from an old bar named "Turcs"
that had been there for many years and was still a hang out for a rather
tough crowd. It seemed as if the police were always showing up there after
some bar brawl.</B>

<P><B>The part of the building that housed the dinner theater used to be
an old bar and grill that was (reputedly) frequented by some rough characters
in the days when that area was home to a busy naval port. (In fact, the
Navy still has an installation near there.)</B>
<BR><B>The "spirit" that hung around there definitely had a mischievous
streak!</B>

<P><B>When I first started working there I heard numerous stories from
the hostess and the kitchen staff, most of whom had been working there
for years. In fact, the previous manager quit because of some uncanny experiences,
mostly voices when she was absolutely alone in the building. Here are just
the few of the things that I&nbsp; personally experienced or knew of...</B>

<P><B>There is an elevator in the lobby that takes patrons to the second
floor. When the restaurant and theater were closed power to the elevator
was shut off. We often held rehearsals in the mornings before the restaurant
opened, and were also there late at night after closing. Often, the elevator
would mysteriously start up on it's own and go back and forth between floors
several times. Each time it stopped the doors would open and close as if
someone where getting on or off.</B>

<P><B>We frequently heard laughter and voices coming from the completely
empty restaurant upstairs, as well as footsteps in the empty lobby.</B>

<P><B>As performers we were responsible for placing our own props before
each show and gathering them up again at the end of the night. Things would
disappear and show up in odd places, so we got into the habit of double
checking right before curtain. The kitchen and office staff also had similar
experiences.</B>

<P><B>One of my fellow performers refused to step foot in the main women's
bathroom after looking up into the mirror one evening and seeing an old
man standing behind her. When she turned to face him there was no one there.
She was so frightened that she barely made it on stage that night.</B>

<P><B>But by far the strangest experience happened after everyone left
for the evening and the manager locked everything up tight. We were in
rehearsals for a new show so the performers (there were eight of us), manager
and director were the last to leave and the first to arrive in the morning.
Upon arriving the next day we discovered that every single piece of tape
in the entire building had been removed. This included ALL rolls of tape
in the offices, in the sound booth, and even in the hostess podium, ALL
of the tape markings on the stage, microphones and mic stands (they were
color coded) and, strangest of all, even the cassette tape from the answering
machines. Go figure!</B>

<BR><B>Pulling Guard Duty</B>
<BR><B>ted.nguyen@wcom.com</B>

<P><B>&nbsp;Back in 1987 when I was in the Army and stationed at Ft. Bragg,
I had my first physical encounter with the paranormals.&nbsp; Being a cherry
(unofficial name for new guy) I had my share of pulling guard duty.&nbsp;
One such duty had my squad (consisting of 8 highly-trained, highly motivated
paratroopers) guarding an ammo site in the middle of the woods.&nbsp; The
guard shift started at 2000 hr. (8pm to you civilians) and lasted until
0600 hrs (or 6am).&nbsp; We each took a 1-hr shift with the first 2 guys
having to do twice so that everyone could get a somewhat decent night's
rest.&nbsp; The cherries (myself included) got the worst shifts (midnight
til 6am).&nbsp; My shift started at 2am and lasted until 3am.&nbsp; Now
that you are familiar with the details, let me going on with the important
stuff.</B>

<P><B>&nbsp; My squad and I got to the site at 7:30pm and pitched camp.&nbsp;
After the shifts were decided, everybody settled down and the first guy
went ahead and walked down the dirt path (about 300 meters) to the ammo
site to pull his shift.&nbsp; The rest of us stayed back at the base camp
to enjoy the fine North Carolina's woods and BS until it was the next guy's
shift.&nbsp; All was well and uneventful.&nbsp; I decided to sack out @
11pm after my last cigarette and crawled into my fart sack (sleeping bag).&nbsp;
Around 0150hr, the previous guard woke me up for my shift.&nbsp; I woke
up, put on my boots, grabbed my gears and weapon (M16A2 rifle- named her
Faith because that's how much I trust her) and went on to meet with the
last guard for a SitRep (situation report).&nbsp; He told me that all was
quiet and the only situation he had was trying to stay awake and fighting
off the mosquitoes (Ft. Bragg has some of the most persistent mosquitoes
on the East Coast).&nbsp; He then told me to quit bothering him so he can
go and get some sleep.&nbsp; So off I went.</B>

<P><B>&nbsp;I walked about 10 paces from the base camp, stopped, lit up
a cigarette, and listened to all the night sounds that was going on all
around me.&nbsp; All was normal.&nbsp; With nothing out of the ordinary,
I proceeded to the head of the dirt trail that would take me down to the
ammo site.&nbsp; As I got to the trail something peculiar happened that
at the time I couldn't put my finger on it.&nbsp; All was quiet.&nbsp;
I mean deathly quiet!&nbsp; The silence you would experience before a really
heavy storm.&nbsp; Not a cricket was chirping!&nbsp; That's unusual for
the woods of North Carolina in the dead of summer.&nbsp; Now, being somewhat
trained in recognizing the signs of an occupied territory, I stopped, knelt
down on one knee (less of a target), and opened wide all my senses to determine
if there was anything out of the ordinary.&nbsp; After about 2 minutes
without hearing, smelling and seeing anything out of the ordinary, I figured
maybe I was just still half asleep and was just being jumpy.&nbsp; So I
continued on.</B>

<P><B>&nbsp;Half way down the trail I realized that Damn, it's kinda chilly
out here. No big deal, the woods always tend to be chilly in the early
morning.&nbsp; Then I heard it!&nbsp; Behind the brush to my left, about
3 paces off the trail, something was rustling it.&nbsp; I stopped, pulled
out my maglite, and shined it toward the direction of the rustles.&nbsp;
Nothing!&nbsp; As I turned off my light and was about to proceed my eyes
caught movements.&nbsp; Something was moving behind the brushes to my left.&nbsp;
I stopped, took a knee, and shined my light once again at the brushes.&nbsp;
Nothing again!&nbsp; As I got up and began walking the rustling started
back up.&nbsp; I stopped and it stopped.&nbsp; Pulling out my light, I
aimed it in the direction of the noise and I called out, "Who's there?
Identify yourself!"&nbsp; No response.&nbsp; I figured it was probably
just a wild dog or a deer so I proceeded with my mission.&nbsp; Then it
happened!&nbsp; Something pushed me!&nbsp; Pushed me hard!&nbsp; Pushed
me so hard that I fell face first onto the trail.&nbsp; I went ass-over-helmet
into the dirt.&nbsp; I got up spitting dirt and leaves out of my mouth
when I heard it.&nbsp; Giggling!&nbsp; Like little girls giggling when
they'd done something silly and thought it was funny.&nbsp; That pissed
me off!&nbsp; I then pulled out my 6" knife from its sheath and began cursing
and threatening whoever that was out there.&nbsp; It was then I heard a
scream and twigs and branches snapping coming my way.&nbsp; Something was
running toward me and it sounded big and angry.&nbsp; I started to back-peddled
toward the base camp not wanting to take my eyes off whatever that was
coming in fear that I might be rushed and tackled.&nbsp; As I was nearing
the camp the sounds of the footsteps slowed down and then disappeared all
together.</B>
<BR><B>Whatever it was can't seem to come out of the woods and into the
open where the camp was situated.&nbsp; Lucky me!</B>

<P><B>&nbsp;After I caught my breath and calmed my nerves (with the help
of a couple of cigarettes smoked very rapidly) I started to think that
maybe a couple these guys back here at the camp were maybe not really asleep
and were up to their pranking ways.&nbsp; I went around and felt all of
the boots to see if any of them were still warm from being recently donned.&nbsp;
None were.&nbsp; Lifting up the boots, I saw dew marks from where dew had
fallen around the boots.&nbsp; None of the boots had been moved!&nbsp;
On top of that, all seven guys had their socks off stuffed inside their
boots respectively because it was too warm to sleep with socks on.&nbsp;
Also there was no ways that any one of the guys could have beaten me back
to the camp and undressed that quickly.&nbsp; The trail was a bee-line
to the camp and whoever it was would have to have had run pass me without
me seeing them.&nbsp; Remember, I was back-peddling toward the camp, knife
drawn, and alert as hell!&nbsp; No way, no how!&nbsp; Realizing I had another
30 minutes of my shift, I decided that there was no way I was going down
the trail again.&nbsp; I pulled the rest of the shift standing at the head
of the trail on full alert.&nbsp; Must have pissed it off because I heard
pacing back and forth (twigs and branches snapping) and growling (gutteral,
like a dog) in the woodlines but it never came out.&nbsp; I stayed up with
the next guy on his shift just as a precaution.&nbsp; Told him that there
might be a wild dog out in the woods and it was best that we stayed just
at the head of the trail.</B>
<BR><B>Didn't tell him about being pushed down or the giggling.&nbsp; We
stood there at the head of the trail all thru his shift but didn't experience
anything more.&nbsp; I stayed up the rest of that night keeping company
with whomever coming on shift.&nbsp; I made an excuse that I was too wired
from all the coffee</B>
<BR><B>I drank to sleep.&nbsp; Caught up on my sleep when we were back
at the barracks. Fortunately, by the time that it was my company's turn
again to pull guard at that same site, I was already starting to out-process
to leave the Army. Whatever it was in the woods that night didn't get a
second chance at me.</B>

is buried in crawl space of the basement, not only doe's he give the date
of his</B>
<BR><B>death” but how” also his full name, the date, and year when he was
killed, and the very place his body is buried. my son at the time was 5years
old, he told me of a boy, who’s name was Johnny, who died in this house,
at the age of 3years,this would not seem so strange, but for the fact that,

<BR><B>A Farm in Lancaster, SC</B>
<BR><B>splint666@comcast.net</B>

<P><B>A family moved into a farm and realized it was haunted. One appearance
was one night the mother was putting her daughter to bed she sat down to
talk to her before leaving&nbsp; the corner of the bed was lifted up as
if someone was tucking the sheets under it. The family was aware of these
hauntings before this happened. a couple of days later the mother and a
friend went around the farm with a digital camera and took movies and pics
of the farm and yes they found orbs and even found smoke rising in one
of the movies (wich only showed up in the movie)but what was quite chilling
about this is an apparition of a man at the corner of the smoke. the man
is dressed in a black robe. you can see his face but it looks more like
a skull. (so it looks like a skeleton wearing a robe) They proceeded on
and went in the next room as soon as the women and her friend went in their
the womens friend started gasping like she was being choked she walked
away out of the room and almost got sick terrified they walk up to the
house to tell the husband what had&nbsp; happened when they looked at her
neck there was a ban swollen like she has been strangled by a very small
chain the family quickly moved to a new farm and that farm stayed empty
for years until they tore it down. I heard this story while visiting family.
And I do believe its true I’ve been to the site but all that stands now
is a couple of barbed wire fence and a singn thats says keep out. I’m 16
years old (15 at the time i heard this) and I Strongly believe in ghost
and probably will become a ghost hunter when I grow up.</B>

<BR><B>An ordinary night</B>
<BR><B>claudchris@hotmail.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;I am shaking as I write this. Nothing like this has ever happened
to me before. I was never one to believe in the supernatural – as a matter
of fact, I am a nuclear physicist, and was a skeptic even as a child. I
only believe what I know to be true, I look for logical explanations for
everything. As a kid, I never felt the slightest bit nervous walking by
the neighborhood ‘haunted house,’ and was the first to accuse other kids
of moving the ouija board. Still the subject has always held a little bit
of fascination for me, perhaps in that I’d like to believe that there is
something more to what I see – I suppose I’m a romantic. I’ve read a lot
of true ghost experiences’ and often feel that the ‘victims’ are actually
just having hypnologic hallucinations.</B>

<P><B>&nbsp;I was sitting, last night, in my living room, watching television.
Realize that I was wide-awake, sipping an espresso, painting my fingernails.
The show that was on was a Frank Lloyd Wright documentary on PBS. My friend
called me and we chatted for a little while. I was fanning my nails in
the air so that they would dry, while I told her my impressions of the
show. We were really just chit-chatting, but it is essential that you realize
I was completely and utterly awake. I wasn’t even the slightest bit sleepy.</B>

<P><B>&nbsp;Suddenly, the television was off. The remote control was both
broken and without batteries, so I couldn’t figure out what had happened.
At first I just assumed that the television had shorted out or something
like that. With my friend still on the phone, I went to the television
and turned it on again. OK, I know this isn’t very interesting yet – and
also know that any surge or lack of could have turned the TV off. I just
said ‘that’s weird’ and kept chatting with my friend – the show back on,
just as it had been.</B>

<P><B>Then, it happened again, and I still was not afraid. Instead of turning
it back on, I said ‘oh well’ to my friend, and we started talking about
the man she was dating. I was relaxed and on the couch, not the slightest
bit disturbed about the television thing, when I laughed loudly at something
she said, and then saw a figure out of the corner of my eye: a dark brownish/grey
shadow with a vague human form. I closed my eyes and opened them again,
then turned toward the place where I’d seen it, and to my surprise, it
was not only still there, but it was closer, and approaching me! It was
female, and sort of average-sized, dressed in what looked like jeans and
a collared shirt (somewhat modern). My friend was still chatting away,
when the figure opened her mouth (I knew it was a mouth, though the lines
of this figure were sort of blurry all the way around, making it hard to
discern her features), and made a noise like a gruff howl. It was very
throaty and made me jump, but also seemed to be directed at me in p</B>

<P><B>I told my friend all about it, and let’s just say that neither of
us slept a wink that night. We both called in sick to work and slept in
this morning. I went back to my apartment and I don’t sense anything weird
in the apartment anymore – it’s almost as though it didn’t happen, but
it did. I’m not sure what to do. I’m not actually afraid (as a matter of
fact, I was really just startled last night, not afraid, because it was
so unexpected), but I’ve got my eyes open to see what happens next!</B>

<BR><B>California Haunting</B>
<BR><B>kelly_7612@yahoo.com</B>

<P><B>When I was seven years old my family purchased a house on the outskirts
of Los Angeles. I remember my father bragging to most anyone he knew that
he got the house for a steal…I guess it didn’t really matter that a stiff
wind could probably knock the house on it’s side…it was that run down.
It was a two level house with the main rooms being on the first floor,
three bedrooms on the second floor, and a small fruit cellar below. When
we first arrived at the house I noticed a mailbox with small stick-on letters
that spelled out ‘H O R T O N’. That was the first thing my father intended
to change. He pulled some stick-on letters out of his pocket and proceeded
to spell out our last name. I promise you…my father tried everything from
industrial strength glue to eventually nails…our letters just would never
stay up. At some point he must of given up and we just left it as was.&nbsp;
As my father was valiantly trying to get those darn letters to stick, my
brother and I charged ahead into the house to do some exploring. There
are two things that stick out in my head from that initial visit. Firstly,
I noticed in one of the upstairs bedrooms a dartboard hanging on the wall
with a single dart placed in the bullseye. I don’t know why, but for some
reason this really disturbed me…maybe because the entire rest of the house
was completely empty…I’m not really sure. Secondly, I noticed that most
of the doors had those old fashioned skeleton keyholes. I was instantly
reminded of the old fairytale where the wife tried everything, including
peering into a keyhole much like this one, to get a look into that forbidden
room. I bent down, placed my eye to the keyhole, and looked into one of
the bedrooms. I think I was curious to know if you could really see anything
by looking into one of those things. Guess what…you can. I remember seeing
something…tall and black, scurry across the floor…something that almost
resembled a large dog. My father surmised that it was probably some type
of animal or quite possible a shadow. In any case, I was relieved to find
out this was to be my parents room.</B>

<P><B>&nbsp; Almost immediately my father began renovations plans. The
entire back end of the house was to be added on to…including a new kitchen
and dining room on the main level, two new bedrooms on the upper level,
and the basement extended below. As the workmen were digging up the ground
in the backyard they uncovered many strange things including an antique
thimble set, childhood toys, coins, an axe handle, photographs, and almost
an entire deck of ‘old maid’ playing cards. As my sister and I sat around
thumbing through these new treasures I happened to glance up just in time
to see my eldest sister falling head first into the pit that was to be
our new basement. To this day…my sister who is now 40…swears she was pushed
violently from behind. In any event the result from this injury was a broken
leg and a few cuts and bruises. We were all warned to be more careful around
the construction site. A few days after this incident, I had a chunk of
plaster thrown at my head. It could have been one of my sisters or my brother
playing a trick, but they were all in their teens at the time and I don’t
think they would find it funny to throw a piece of plaster at their little
sisters head.</B>

<P><B>&nbsp; Strange things were occurring inside the house as well. I
constantly felt as though I was being watched and was often plagued by
feelings of absolute horror. I might be in a room playing or watching the
television, when an overpowering feeling to flee the room would hit…believe
me when I say…I did just that. My sisters were constantly at each other’s
throats over missing items. Sometimes, these items would reappear in bizarre
spots… some were never seen again. Lights and appliances would turn on
by themselves, footsteps could be heard in the middle of the night, items
would come crashing down in unoccupied rooms, a strange buzzing sound…almost
like an electrical charge…seemed to emanate throughout the entire house,
and the list goes on. We also had a problem with fires. My mother was awoken
in the middle of the night by the smell of smoke. Upon investigation, she
found that someone had closed the cover on our toaster oven and hit the
‘start’ button with nothing being inside. This is an old 70’s style oven
where you actually had to press a release button to turn the power off
otherwise it would just keep on going. By the time my mother reached the
scene the entire toaster was up in flames, practically burned to a crisp.
That was the first of seven fires that occurred in that house.</B>

<P><B>&nbsp; As a child I detested peanut butter…even the smell of it would
send my stomach churning. My brother found it amusing to consume a sandwich
and then hold me down and breathe on me…gross. Anyhow I was sitting in
the living room watching the ‘Saturday Morning Cartoon Marathon’ when my
brother walked in fresh from eating a P&amp;B sandwich. I knew what was
coming and I wasn’t in the mood for his games…a constant pounding sound
had kept me awake for half the night and I was cranky from lack of sleep.
We began to tussle but were abruptly interrupted. From out of nowhere,
an insole from a pair of shoes fell on the floor between us. We just stood
there and stared at each other for a few seconds, our hand still on each
other’s shoulders. This insole actually seemed as though it fell straight
out of the ceiling. As we were trying to figure out the origin of this
peculiar item, we were startled by a loud knock at the front door. From
our vantage point we could both see the front door from where we were standing.
There stood an old lady with whitish hair wearing a black shawl. Something
about her eyes struck me as odd…they were so dark...it almost appeared
as though someone had stuck two large black button in her eye sockets.
As my brother approached the door she vanished almost like she had never
been there at all. It’s not as though she simply turned and walked away…she
disappeared into thin air…one minute she was there…the next she was gone.
I would be lying if I said we opened the front door to take a look around
but we did peer out the window checking for any signs of where she may
have went. We saw nothing on the front yard, nor on the drive- way. My
brother was convinced that we had just seen a witch. When we returned to
the living room the mysterious insole from the shoe was also missing…it’s
also interesting to note that a fenced in gate surrounded our entire property…for
someone to gain access to the grounds they would need to be electronically
buzzed in. This still puzzles me to this day.</B>

<P><B>&nbsp; My brother being the inventive boy that he was, liked to build
forts. They were mostly constructed of yardsticks and blankets or whatever
else he could get his hands on. When my mother saw us playing in there
one day she forbade it, as she feared I could suffocate myself. Even though
I was seven at the time I was very small for my age. I reluctantly agreed
and scampered off to play in my bedroom. I was playing with some dolls
when a little boy walked in. Now I don’t know who or what this boy was
but to me he looked like a real person…I honestly thought he was a friend
of my brothers although he did seem a little young to be chumming around
with my bro. I remember him asking me if I wanted to play. Being lonely
and not having many friends I quickly agreed and was happy to have a new
playmate. He suggested playing in the fort. Now I knew I wasn’t supposed
to do that but I was just so happy to have a new friend that I agreed and
made a mental note to be extra careful while inside the fort. Almost as
soon as we were inside the fort, the little boy told me that he had to
go but that I should wait there for him to come back in a little while.
I have no idea how long I waited but some time later I heard my entire
family frantically calling my name obviously searching for me. To this
day I have no idea why I didn’t answer…maybe I was afraid of being caught…I
don’t know. The blanket that served as a door was yanked up and I saw my
mother’s anxious face peering inside. Eventually I explained the entire
story to my parents. Although they believed me, the identity of that boy
remains unknown, and I ever saw him again. There were only five other families
that lived on our street and we knew all of the neighborhood children...it
wasn’t any of them. I kick myself now for not even asking the boy what
his name was…that might have helped some. I’ve read many stories on this
and other sites but I’ve never heard of anyone actually interacting with
a ghost as I’ve just mentioned. Weird huh?!? Thinking back on that little
boy the only thing that struck me as being a little off is the way he moved...it
was slow...yet fast…and his movements were jerky…if that makes any sense.
Also, for a young boy…his voice was very mature and sounded very much like
the voice of my father. I know it sounds truly bizarre but I swear it happened...and
even though it’s been 20 years since this event took place I still remember
it as though it was yesterday.</B>

<P><B>&nbsp; We stayed in that house for a total of 5 years and as the
years passed strange things continued to happen. My entire family suffered
in one way or another from the haunting, my eldest sister suffering the
most, but for the time being I’ll stick to my own stories. For Christmas
one year my aunt had given me a hideous green and orange stuffed clown
whose nose would glow red and play a musical melody. At first glance I
hated this thing and quickly stuffed it in some dark recess in my closet.
Some time in the middle of the night I had awoken, desperately needing
to use the restroom. The idea of walking through darkened hallways at 3:00am
was not a desirable prospect but by this point it was an absolute necessity.
I made my way down the stairs and was just about to round the corner into
the living room when I heard it. Soft ‘jewelry box’ music was coming in
the general direction of the living room. Peeking my head around the corner
I saw the stuffed, Xmas clown, propped up in the middle of the couch, it’s
nose glowing in the darkness. I high-tailed it back upstairs, wetting myself
in the process, and jumped in my bed shaking like a leaf. It scared me
to death.</B>

<P><B>&nbsp; Nothing scared me more in that house then the spirit who I
dubbed ‘the old man’. I saw him many times both inside the house and also
in the fields behind our house just kind of standing there…staring intently
up at the house. He always wore a brown business type suit and a top hat.
I’ve had many nightmares about him over the years. Most of them would entail
me being in a room with my back to the doorway…instinctively my back would
tense…I would spin around…and he would pounce…charging at me full speed
from the other end of the room…sometimes carrying an axe…sometimes not.
One thing that sticks out in these dreams is that he was somehow more vivid
and colorful then the rest of his surrounding…he always seemed to stand
out, if you know what I mean. I always felt that he was standing right
behind me on the staircase ready to give me a good push. Indeed, I did
fall down those stairs many, many times no matter how careful I was, but
luckily I was ever seriously injured. I know this sounds crazy, heck...the
whole story sounds crazy…but I think he used to like to hang out in my
walk-in closet and hiss so loudly that it almost sounded like a rattlesnake.
I think he got a kick out of scaring me, as he liked to turn the lights
out on me. When you walked down into the basement there was only one switch
for the entire area situated to the left of the door as you were heading
downstairs. Now I hated to go down there for anything but it was a must
on this day, because our fridge had burned out once again…dying appliances
were a big problem in my house. Seeing as the only other working fridge
was in the basement my mother asked me to go down there to get some necessary
item for dinner that evening. I ran down the steps…to the refrigerator…grabbed
whatever it was I was supposed to get...and bam…the lights went out. I
started screaming and ran for the stairs, absolutely certain that he was
hot on my heels. As I was finally reaching for the door...I heard it…and
I swear I will never forget this…laughter…but just not any old laughter…this
laughter literally chilled me to the bone…it was somehow evil and mocking
as if to say…I missed you this time but next time you may not be so lucky.&nbsp;
Needless to say…I was spooked. I’m not sure who it was who was laughing...but
I do know that the laughter was male and only my mother and I were at home
at the time. At some point his shadow also began to show up on our living
room wall. My sister and I were watching a movie one night when I first
saw it…there was no mistaking it...this shadow was definitely of a person
and somehow darker and more opaque then what a regular shadow should be.
We moved everything around in that room, shaking our hands in front of
it, trying to figure out its origin or what might be causing it to no avail.
That shadow appeared in the same spot every night until we moved from the
house, sometimes disappearing for a few hours only to reappear sometime
later. I think this guys also liked to mess around with the phone lines.
Many times when you picked up the phone all you could hear was static or
there might be a couple of voices in the background although you could
never make out exactly what they were saying. On one occasion I picked
up the phone only to hear ear-shattering static...before I had enough time
to put the receiver back on it’s cradle, I heard a man say, ‘hello, HELLO,’
in a slightly, ok…VERY mocking manner, and then that same god-dammed laughter.
That really scared me. Other people, including my grandmother, reported
calling our home, and a strange man would answer…a second later the phone
would start to ring normally, and one of us would eventually answer. This
to say the least unnerved me to no end. Once and only once, I was upstairs
in my bedroom listening to the stereo with a girlfriend of mine on one
of those perfect, sunny, southern California afternoons. We were kind of
goofing off singing along…when a man’s voice started to come through on
the radio. Believe me when I say this was no radio broadcast…the language
was foul and violent, much too obscene to be repeated here. My friend and
I just stared at each other becoming more frightened by the minute. When
I finally couldn’t take it anymore I reached over and pulled the plug thinking
that would put an end to the disturbing episode. To my complete astonishment
the radio just kept on playing Ok…playtime is over...time to head to my
friends house.</B>

<P><B>&nbsp; I really don’t know how to explain this but somehow we learned
to live with these things as a family. I got used to being afraid, expected
things to go missing, I barely glanced if a door slammed on it’s own or
a light mysteriously came on, I expected to hear my name being called out
in the middle of the night, and so on. Was I still scared…ummmm…yeah…deathly
terrified might be a better term, but somehow I learned to live with it.
Maybe these ghosts or spirits or whatever you want to call them sensed
that and decided to turn it up a notch. Now I’m not really sure what happened
next because my father in now deceased and refused to talk about this with
anyone other than my mother, and she too, refuses to discuss this. All
I know is that my two sisters, my brother, my mother and I, traveled to
Arizona for four days to visit my grandmother leaving my father in the
house by himself. Something obviously happened which really spooked my
father. One night I eavesdropped in on a conversation that my dad was having
with my mother and all I could really make out was something about ‘borrowed
time?!?’, all of the windows opening at once,’ and ‘an old man’. The very
next day my father decided that we were moving as soon as possible and
was putting the house up for sale. With that being said the entire family
decided to go out for dinner and celebrate.</B>

<P><B>&nbsp; Upon returning home, something caught my eye that was sort
of strange. A single light was burning in my parent’s bedroom. Now if you
knew my father you would know that he is a complete stickler about leaving
lights on…the #1 rule in my house was to shut off the lights as soon as
you left a room…a light left burning in my parent’s bedroom of all places
was quite odd. As soon as my father unlocked the front door our two dogs
came rushing out…I thought I was going to have a heart attack at twelve
years of age. On further inspection it seemed as though the dogs had literally
tried to chew their way out the front door given the huge bite/scratch
marks all over the front door. As soon as my father flicked on the lights,
I gasped…its kind of hard to describe what I saw. The entire house was
in disarray...the living room couch was standing on it’s side, lamps were
broken, mirrors shattered, drawers yanked out of kitchen cabinets, silverware
strewn all over the floor…My father was convinced that someone had broken
into the house. We were told to remain outside the house while my mother
and brother walked to a neighbors house to call the police…this was before
cell phones. The police arrived somewhere between a half an hour to an
hour later...an actual police report is documented concerning these events.
The police checked the doors and windows for signs of an intruder, dusted
for prints, talked to our neighbors, and checked the house thoroughly for
anyone who might still be lurking around. Their investigation turned up
nothing. My father ordered us all upstairs to pack up some belongings…we
weren’t staying. As I was heading into my bedroom I happened to glance
into my parents room and noticed that the lamp sitting on my father’s nightstand
was starting to burn the wallpaper behind it. I don’t know if this was
just my nerves or what but it honestly looked as though the pattern of
the burn was turning into a face…a face of none other then the old man
who had been haunting me for years. As I was standing there looking at
it…my mother came up behind me and gasped…I think she saw the same thing
as I did. When I arrived at my grandmother’s house later on that evening,
I heard my mom and dad discussing with my grandmother some of the things
that had happened to them while living in that house. If I had known these
things while living there, there is no way I would have gotten even one
night of decent sleep…not that I did anyways.</B>

<P><B>&nbsp; It’s now been over 20 years since I’ve lived in that house
yet it still continues to haunt me. Considering the fact that we lived
in that house for just over five years, numerous other events took place
that I haven’t included, but it’s hard to fit five years of living into
a single submission. The house is still standing and I occasionally drive
by just for kicks. The house has been almost completely renovated from
the outside. Often when I drive by I see a for-sale sign perched up on
the front lawn…it seems as though no one stays in that house for too long.
It’s interesting to note that I have never again experienced anything ghostly
or unworldly since leaving that house. That remains my one and only true
experience with the other side.</B>
