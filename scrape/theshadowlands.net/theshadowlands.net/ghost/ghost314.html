<br><b>More Rowdy Spirits</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: amberaxon@yahoo.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>The ghosts in my house have taken to talking. Just the other night,
I awoke with the strange feeling someone had been talking and that's what
woke me up. You've all had that experience. My mind was telling me that
it was true, someone had been talking to me. Alone at night, I can hear
people whispering to each other. There is definitely more than one voice.
Which scares me, for it leads me to believe that there is more than one
ghost. I'm wiccan, and we wiccans believe heavily in a spirit world, but
we believe that the spirits are nothing to fear. But tell that to my friend.
He has always been able to sense and see spirits, a gift he does not consider
a gift. I don't think the boy has had a good night's sleep in a long time.
One night he was walking past my house when he saw a woman dressed in white,
standing on my front porch. He called out, thinking it might be my mom
or at least a relative. He almost ran when the woman turned to face him.
She stared back at him with what he described as red eyes. As if that wasn't
enough for him, he just had to tempt fate and he walked past the front
porch toward my back gate. He told me he looked in my back yard and saw
at least three more ghosts wandering, with a forth leaning against my pool.
I heard someone frantically knocking at my back door. When I let him in,
I saw a long scrap on his left arm. I asked him what happened, and all
he could say was "it was the lady on the front porch"&nbsp; I looked out
and saw nothing there. By the time I came back to the kitchen, he had calmed
down enough to tell me all that he saw.</b>
<br><b>The ghosts also seem to have a playful side, and I often see my
kitten playing with them. You can see her chasing something that isn't
there at least once a day. As soon as she gets it under my bed, she will
come racing out, butt tucked under, running away from whatever she was
chasing.</b>
<br><b>Now, I'm not christian, nor do I believe in the christian notions
of god or satan. I have tried several times to expel the spirits myself,
but to no avail. It only seems to make them more active. But perhaps it's
time for me to suck it up, and call in a priest!</b><b></b>

<p><b>Touchy Objects</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: tbird_1981@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Touch lamps are supposed to be activated by the warmth of a human
touch...but when no one is in the room and they go on, something else must've
touched it.&nbsp; On numerous occasions, with a locked door, I'd return
to find my lamp on.</b>
<br><b>And there were other times when the calendar that I hanging on a
hook would fall down all by its self.&nbsp; This was not just the wind,
or a figment of my imagination, as my mother was also witness to the calendar
somehow lifting it's self off the hook and falling to the floor.&nbsp;
Seeing as tho it was hung right by my closet door, it was almost as if
someone's hand from behind my closet door was lifting the calendar off
it's hook.</b><b></b>

<br><b>My Husband's Uncle</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: SEvelia51@cs.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>As a wedding gift in November 1980, we received a house from my husbands</b>
<br><b>parents.&nbsp; The house was located in Humacao, Puerto Rico.&nbsp;
It was a standard three</b>
<br><b>bedroom cement house on about a quarter acre of land.&nbsp; The
house had belonged</b>
<br><b>to my husband's paternal grandmother.&nbsp; It was furnished with
lovely antique</b>
<br><b>furniture.</b>
<br><b>The master bedroom was too small for our needs so we doubled the
size of it</b>
<br><b>and added on a master bathroom.&nbsp; Before I moved to the house
I knew that my</b>
<br><b>husband's uncle had died in the back yard of the house.&nbsp; He
had major heart</b>
<br><b>surgery.&nbsp; And had been recuperating at home.&nbsp; According
to my husband he was very</b>
<br><b>stubborn and bored from over a month of total bed rest.&nbsp; So
when his sister who</b>
<br><b>was a nurse&nbsp; left to do some shopping, he got out of bed and
went into the</b>
<br><b>back yard to do some gardening.&nbsp; Which is where she found him
dead about three</b>
<br><b>hours later.&nbsp; He died of internal bleeding from the surgery.&nbsp;
Since the house</b>
<br><b>originally belonged to the grandmother and the uncle had died with
no direct</b>
<br><b>heir, the house had not been lived in for about four years until
the estate was</b>
<br><b>settled.&nbsp; We were actually the first people to live in the
house after his</b>
<br><b>death.</b>
<br><b>I thought is was kind of a tragic story but thought nothing of it.&nbsp;
Part of</b>
<br><b>the remodeling of the house was all new plumbing and a new electrical
system to</b>
<br><b>accommodate all the new electrical stuff most modern households
have.&nbsp; Among</b>
<br><b>the things we changed were the light switches from the old fashion
click kind</b>
<br><b>to the new silent ones.</b>
<br><b>We had been living in the house about two months when it happened.&nbsp;
I woke up</b>
<br><b>to the slam of the screen door in the kitchen.&nbsp; I looked at
the digital clock</b>
<br><b>which read 11:30 P.M.&nbsp; At first I thought it might be a robber,
but we had</b>
<br><b>iron gates on all the windows and chains on the front iron gate
door to the car</b>
<br><b>port.&nbsp; Which is where this person was coming in from.&nbsp;
I was sure I would have</b>
<br><b>heard something before this, if it was a break-in, unless the person
had a</b>
<br><b>key.&nbsp; I though maybe my father in law had an argument with
his wife and came to</b>
<br><b>sleep in our guest room.</b>
<br><b>Anyway, this is what I heard.&nbsp; The screen door in the kitchen
slammed shut.</b>
<br><b>I heard the click of the light switch in the kitchen.&nbsp; I heard
that switch</b>
<br><b>click off and than the hall switch click on.&nbsp; I heard footsteps
down the hall</b>
<br><b>into the original bathroom that was half way down the hall to our
bedroom.&nbsp; Than</b>
<br><b>I heard the click of the bathroom light and the water turned on
in the sink.</b>
<br><b>The person did not apparently bother to close the bathroom door.&nbsp;
Than I heard</b>
<br><b>the water turned off and the bathroom light was clicked off and
footsteps</b>
<br><b>toward our door and a click as the hall light was turned off.&nbsp;
Here is where I</b>
<br><b>realized this was not my father in law.&nbsp; When he turned of
the hall light I</b>
<br><b>suddenly realized there was no light coming in under our bedroom
door.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>remembered that our light switches didn't make the clicking sound
anymore. The</b>
<br><b>doorknob to our bedroom turned the door opened and the click of
the light being</b>
<br><b>turned on except the light didn't turn on.&nbsp; There was a full
moon so I could see</b>
<br><b>clearly and there was nothing to see.&nbsp; The footsteps went toward
the original</b>
<br><b>closet, the hangers started rattling, than the footsteps came toward
the bed and</b>
<br><b>"He" sat down on the edge of the bed, I saw the indentation on the
bed ON MY</b>
<br><b>SIDE.&nbsp; I heard shoes being taken of, I heard&nbsp; "him" get
up and put the shoes</b>
<br><b>in the closet, he came back to the bed and sat down again.&nbsp;
I saw the</b>
<br><b>indentation in the mattress.&nbsp; And that was enough for me, before
this thing climbed</b>
<br><b>into bed with me, I climbed over my husband to the other side of
the bed and</b>
<br><b>turned on the bedside lamp.&nbsp; This is when my husband woke up.&nbsp;
To see me standing</b>
<br><b>next to him with my eyes glued to the other side of the bed.&nbsp;
Where I had</b>
<br><b>clearly seen the indentation of a body lying on the bed next to
him until I turned</b>
<br><b>on the light.&nbsp; Than nothing.&nbsp; He said what's the matter
you look like a</b>
<br><b>ghost.&nbsp; I said still staring at the other side of the bed,
"I think your uncle just</b>
<br><b>came home."&nbsp;&nbsp; At this he turned pale and jumped out of
bed to stand next to</b>
<br><b>me, and said, "What do you mean?"&nbsp; I explained to him what
I described above.</b>
<br><b>At this point we both decided that perhaps we had not picked the
best</b>
<br><b>location for the bed and that it would be better off located against
the wall of the</b>
<br><b>new part of the bedroom.&nbsp; So we dismantled our king-size bed,
and put it back</b>
<br><b>together against the wall of the new part of the bedroom.&nbsp;
Neither of us slept</b>
<br><b>very well the rest of that night even though nothing else happened.&nbsp;
That</b>
<br><b>night.</b>
<br><b>After that occasionally either he or I would hear the clicking and
the</b>
<br><b>footsteps etc.&nbsp; But at least he didn't sit or lie down on our
bed anymore.&nbsp; That is</b>
<br><b>my ghost story.</b><b></b>
<p>
<hr width="100%"><b></b>
<p><b>It all Started</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:sloppypelican@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I guess it all started when I was in the 4th grade.&nbsp; We had
bought a rest/bar on Rt. 7&nbsp; it sat on approx. 4-5 acres.&nbsp; The
basement of this bar had rooms that were all different heights, and they
had dirt floors.&nbsp; I never felt very comfortable there.(We had built
a condo above the rest. and lived there until I was 16)&nbsp; One day my
cousin came over and we were bored we had no idea what to get into, so
we decided to go dig in the basement to see if we could find anything interesting.&nbsp;
The 2 of us each took a stick and started digging in opposite directions.&nbsp;
All of a sudden we heard this high pitch woman scream.&nbsp; We looked
at each other didn't say a word, and took off running upstairs to the bar.&nbsp;
We went up to our barmaid and asked if she heard anything she said no but
the t.v. turned off by itself.&nbsp; A few months went by and the phone
in the bar would just fly off the wall by itself.&nbsp; Then my father
was down in the basement one day and there was this one room he was trying
to get into he had to crawl on the dirt to get in, and once he was in there
he found a pair of shackles.&nbsp; The rumor is this rest. was built where
they used to have an underground railroad for slaves.&nbsp; A few years
later my dad decided to subdivide and build us a house on this property.&nbsp;
He had done construction all his life.&nbsp; So as they layed the foundation
they had to let it sit overnight, the next day the foundation had collapsed
for no reason at all.&nbsp; No one had an explanation for it.&nbsp; They
encountered many problems building that house.&nbsp; Once it was completed
I was 16 and we moved in.&nbsp; The first week in there I would sit in
my bedroom petrified to leave the room because I would see a shadow peek
around the corner and no one else was home.&nbsp; One night m ex-husband
was there and he woke me up in the middle of the night to every appliance
in the kitchen going off, the cabinets were opening and shutting, so we
got up to see what exactly was happening and as we turned the corner to
walk in the kitchen it stopped and everything was in it's place.&nbsp;
My mom was on the other side of the house and we would hear things in the
middle of the night being picked up and thrown across the basement floor.&nbsp;&nbsp;
But one ofthe scariest things that ever happened to me was I was sleeping
and in my dream I was looking out our front bay window and I saw this smoke
and it was actually a spirit, and it jumped into my body.&nbsp; I saw my
mother walk by and tried to scream and couldn't say anything.&nbsp; I tried
to wake myself up from this dream and couldn't&nbsp; finally after what
seemed like an eternity I woke up and called my mother(we had 2 seperate
phone numbers inside the house)and made her come sleep in my room because
I was to scared.&nbsp; I had some other strange things happen but these
were the scariest.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Bedroom Haunting</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: tbird_1981@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>It was late one night, I was lying in my bed trying to sleep, when
I looked over towards the corner of my room.&nbsp; There in the corner
was a small black figure just standing there.</b>
<br><b>I closed my eyes and tried to tell myself that nothing was there.&nbsp;
When I opened my eyes again, the figure was kneeling right beside my bed
looking at me with glowing red eyes.&nbsp; I turned over quickly and closed
my eyes again.</b>
<br><b>When I looked back it was gone, and I have never seen it again nor
do I ever want to see it again!</b>

<br><b>The Out House</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: SEvelia51@cs.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>In 1955 my mother was basically forced by my doctor to take me to
Puerto Rico</b>
<br><b>to live for one year because of my poor health.&nbsp; He told my
parents that if I</b>
<br><b>passed one more winter in NYC I would probably die.</b>
<br><b>I went to live with my mother in Las Piedras, Puerto Rico at my
Cousin's</b>
<br><b>House Fining (not her real name).&nbsp; Generally it was wonderful,
it was the first</b>
<br><b>year in my life that I could remember where I didn't get asthma.
Fining was one</b>
<br><b>of the nicest people you ever want to meet.&nbsp;&nbsp; Fining was
in the process of</b>
<br><b>converting her wooden house into a cement house and due to this
did not yet have</b>
<br><b>indoor plumbing, which meant she had an Out House.&nbsp; This was
my big problem,</b>
<br><b>the Out House, I hated the Out House, it was smelly, full of bugs,
and worst</b>
<br><b>yet had no electricity.&nbsp; As luck would have it I got sick to
my stomach and had</b>
<br><b>dysentery.&nbsp; Requiring many trips to the Out House, with an
oil lamp in hand.</b>
<br><b>It was late at night, everyone was asleep and I was once again for
what</b>
<br><b>seemed the&nbsp; hundredth time back in the Out House.&nbsp; Let
me describe it.&nbsp; It was</b>
<br><b>basically nine sheets of tin.&nbsp; Two on each side nailed onto
wooden beams that made</b>
<br><b>a frame. One piece of tin serving as a door on hinges with a slide
lock and a</b>
<br><b>piece of tin also served as a roof.&nbsp; With a hole in the ground,
some cement</b>
<br><b>blocks on top of a cement floor approximately the height of a normal
toilet</b>
<br><b>with a toilet seat on top. The light from the oil lamp was dim,
leaving many</b>
<br><b>corners in the Out House dark.&nbsp; Being a child of six, I could
imagine spiders and</b>
<br><b>water-bugs and such hiding in the dark corners waiting for the light
to go out</b>
<br><b>so they could eat me.&nbsp; To say I was nervous was putting it
mildly.&nbsp; I was</b>
<br><b>being brave about it, and I refused to use a chamber pot like a
baby.&nbsp; I got sick</b>
<br><b>if I had to clean it and I didn't want my mother to have to deal
with the</b>
<br><b>mess either.&nbsp; So there I sat listening to all the night bugs.&nbsp;
In a healthy</b>
<br><b>tropical environment there are lots of creepy crawlies.&nbsp; Bugs,
lizards, worms,</b>
<br><b>frogs and spiders.</b>
<br><b>Suddenly there was complete silence.&nbsp; My first thought was
what in the world</b>
<br><b>happened to the bugs.&nbsp; Than to my right seemingly far away,
I heard step-drag</b>
<br><b>and the rattling of chains.&nbsp; I thought how weird, it sound
like someone is</b>
<br><b>dragging something with chains on it or that...something...is attached
to ...</b>
<br><b>their leg.&nbsp; Oh no!</b>
<br><b>It's a convict.&nbsp; I had seen a movie where these men were dressed
in these</b>
<br><b>black and white strip pajama things and they had a ball and chain
attached to</b>
<br><b>there leg so they couldn't run away.&nbsp; I remembered thinking
when I saw the movie</b>
<br><b>that they must have been really evil men to deserve such horrible
treatment.</b>
<br><b>At this point I decided it was time to scream for my Mom.&nbsp;
But I couldn't I</b>
<br><b>was frozen in place, I couldn't move anything and my voice seemed
to have</b>
<br><b>disappeared as well.&nbsp; I kept screaming Mom, Mom in my mind
but my mouth didn't even</b>
<br><b>open.&nbsp; As the convict got closer step-drag, I was overcome
with feelings of</b>
<br><b>anguish and extreme terror.&nbsp; My body began to shake uncontrollably
and sweat</b>
<br><b>poured down my body along with tears from my eyes.&nbsp; But I couldn't
get my stupid</b>
<br><b>body to move.&nbsp; The convict was now right outside the door of
the Out House and</b>
<br><b>I heard a soft sob. Than another along with heavy labored breathing.&nbsp;
The</b>
<br><b>convict was crying and apparently exhausted from the sound of his
breathing.</b>
<br><b>Then I felt a wave of overpowering sadness and despair.&nbsp; The
convict kept going</b>
<br><b>of to my left step-drag.&nbsp; The sound continued fading away to
my left until it</b>
<br><b>seemed like he was very far away.&nbsp; Suddenly all the normal
night noises</b>
<br><b>returned along with my ability to move and best of all scream.&nbsp;
And scream I did,</b>
<br><b>over and over again until I heard my mothers voice outside the Out
House door.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>opened the door and jumped into my mothers arms hysterically crying.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Mom</b>
<br><b>did you hear him? Did you see him?&nbsp; My mother was trying to
calm me down, I</b>
<br><b>didn't normally become hysterical over nothing.&nbsp; My mother
said, See who, hear</b>
<br><b>who?&nbsp;&nbsp; The convict with the ball and chain.&nbsp; My mother
said, Who had a ball and</b>
<br><b>chain?&nbsp; I said the convict he was here right outside the Out
House in our back</b>
<br><b>yard he was crying didn't you hear him?&nbsp;&nbsp; I neglected
to mention that my</b>
<br><b>screaming woke up the whole neighborhood and everyone was crowding
around my mother</b>
<br><b>and me trying to figure out who was trying to kill me considering
how</b>
<br><b>distraught I was.&nbsp; When our next door neighbor hearing me,
said, "Oh you heard our</b>
<br><b>neighborhood ghost.&nbsp; What a privilege." I thought, "Privilege?&nbsp;&nbsp;
Ghost, did he</b>
<br><b>say ghost? Is he crazy?"&nbsp; I was scared enough when I thought
it was a living</b>
<br><b>breathing human being never mind a ghost.&nbsp; I was definitely
never going in this</b>
<br><b>back yard again at night.</b>
<br><b>Than he told this story.&nbsp; When Puerto Rico was under the&nbsp;
Spanish Government.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;They built the railroad.&nbsp; But they didn't have enough
laborers.&nbsp; So they</b>
<br><b>used prisoners.&nbsp; They put balls and chains on them so they
couldn't get away and</b>
<br><b>if they tried they could easily track them down and shoot them as
an example</b>
<br><b>to the rest. Despite this many still tried to escape, because it
was either</b>
<br><b>escape or die because of the harsh treatment they received.&nbsp;
The people in the</b>
<br><b>neighborhood who had been "privileged" to see or hear him believed
this man did</b>
<br><b>not know he was dead, and was still trying to get home to his family.&nbsp;
When he</b>
<br><b>said this I suddenly understood all the feelings I got.&nbsp; The
sadness,</b>
<br><b>despair, anguish and overpowering terror, were not really mine but
his and he had</b>
<br><b>somehow communicated them to me.&nbsp; I think he most have finally
found his way</b>
<br><b>home, because no one has heard him in years.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Menger Hotel Haunting</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: jedmonds@dhmtlaw.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I just wanted to let you all know of an experience I had while staying
in</b>
<br><b>The Menger Hotel in San Antonio, Texas in July of 2002.</b>
<br><b>I was staying at the hotel for a court reporter's convention.&nbsp;
I had just</b>
<br><b>arrived at the hotel during a late afternoon and my friend came
down to meet</b>
<br><b>me in an area close to the parking garage.&nbsp; As were were about
to enter the</b>
<br><b>hotel lobby from a long hallway entrance, I saw a man approaching
us coming</b>
<br><b>from the oppositie direction-so that we would have to pass by him,
face to</b>
<br><b>face.&nbsp; He had caught my eye from a distance because of the
way he was</b>
<br><b>walking--almost unaware of his surroundings but also walking as
if he might</b>
<br><b>have been a manager of some type.&nbsp; That is the feeling I got
from his walk.</b>
<br><b>I could see that he was a very tall man as he approached.&nbsp;
He wore a dark</b>
<br><b>suit and had red hair with spectacle glasses on and an old-fashined
"curly"</b>
<br><b>mustache.&nbsp; As he approached, I became a little scared but decided
that as we</b>
<br><b>passed each other I would just look up into his eyes.&nbsp; When
we passed each</b>
<br><b>other, he did look at me, very slowly turning his head and gave
a slow nod</b>
<br><b>and faint smile.&nbsp; I asked my friend who also saw him if she
had gotten a</b>
<br><b>weird feeling when wehad passed him and she agreed that she had.</b>
<br><b>I asked the front desk agent a little later--non-chalantly-- if
a "costume</b>
<br><b>party" or reneactment of some sort had taken place that day in the
area and</b>
<br><b>if they had a manger that fit the man's description.&nbsp; I received
a</b>
<br><b>resounding no to all of my questions. I did not want to tell them
that I</b>
<br><b>thougt I had seena ghost as I knew that the hotel is kown for sightings-but</b>
<br><b>I was not going to acknowledge anything of the sort.</b>
<br><b>My friend and I were staying on the historic side of the hotel.&nbsp;
Our room</b>
<br><b>remained FREEZING for all of the nights we spent at the hotel and
we could</b>
<br><b>not adjust the temperature.&nbsp; I had brought a wicker basket
of fruit and</b>
<br><b>snacks for us to nibble on and had set it on the bureau in our room.&nbsp;
Early</b>
<br><b>in the morning I was awoken by the sound of the wicker basket being
moved or</b>
<br><b>trying to be picked up.&nbsp; The sharp sound of the wicker weaving
is what I</b>
<br><b>heard.&nbsp; I would not look over at the basket.&nbsp; I did note
that my friend was</b>
<br><b>in bed asleep and could not have moved the basket.&nbsp; I remember
exiting the</b>
<br><b>hotel doors, which are plated with brass and are very heavy and
they started</b>
<br><b>moving to open seconds before I put my hands on them, but I know
they moved!</b>
<br><b>Then, I came back to my room and took a shirt off and placed it
on the</b>
<br><b>doorknob of the bathroom.&nbsp; When I got back to the room from
having gone</b>
<br><b>swimming, my shirt had been moved to the edge of my bed and I we
had already</b>
<br><b>had maid service that day and did not require anything new from
housekeeping</b>
<br><b>and my friend had not been back to the hotel room.&nbsp; Then, that
night, I was</b>
<br><b>on my way down to the lobby desk to find out about check out time
for the</b>
<br><b>next day.&nbsp; I decided to take the stairs instead of the elevator.&nbsp;
As I</b>
<br><b>looked over the mezzanine to the other side, there was nobody there.&nbsp;
Then</b>
<br><b>in a matter of seconds I looked again and there was the SAME man
I had seen</b>
<br><b>the previous day, standing on the edge of the railing, immediately
catching</b>
<br><b>my eye with his stare and smile, and lifted his eyebrows up at me
as if he</b>
<br><b>was flirting!&nbsp; I remember feeling scared and at the same time
dissappointed</b>
<br><b>because I had liked him better when I had passed him by in the hallway
the</b>
<br><b>previous day and he had just given me a nod!&nbsp; It was the same
person I had</b>
<br><b>seen the day before with the same suit on and same glasses, and
same</b>
<br><b>mustache!</b>

<br><b>My Own Experiences</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: charleysangel90@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I read your stories and I thought about my own.</b>
<br><b>When I was about two years old, just four years after we had built
our house, I saw a transparent womanly figure in a long black dress in
our dining room.&nbsp; I told my mom and she thought I was making it up.&nbsp;
A little while later, I saw a man with a cane outside in our backyard.&nbsp;
I again told my mom and she thought nothing of it.&nbsp; My mother worked
at a real estate agency, and one day a psychic came in.&nbsp; The first
thing she told my mother was, “You have two spirits in your house, one
is a man with a can and the other is a woman in a long black dress.&nbsp;
Don’t worry, they won’t hurt you.&nbsp; They are just here to watch over
the house.&nbsp; My mother had never told anyone about my sightings because
she, as I have said before, didn’t believe me.&nbsp; The sightings stopped
until just recently.&nbsp; About a year ago I was in my room, and I had
just cut my lights off and was about to get in the bed.&nbsp; When I laid
down, I saw a glowing pale white figure standing in the corner of my room.&nbsp;
I recognized the woman and she smiled at me.&nbsp; I just went to sleep,
too terrified to move.&nbsp; About six months after that I was outside,
because my mother had upset me.&nbsp; I sat down on a fallen log and was
crying.&nbsp; I felt a cold sensation run through my right arm.&nbsp; I
turned and I saw the man sitting beside me.&nbsp; I ran back in the house.&nbsp;
This has been the last of the sightings.</b>
<br><b>I have not shared my experiences with anyone else.&nbsp; I did not
believe anyone could help me.&nbsp; I am scared I will see these sightings
again, and I do not know what they want.&nbsp; All I know about the land
my house is built on that it used to be a school that was torn down in
the 1800s.</b>

<p><b>Broadripple Bridge Farm, Logansport, IN</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:&nbsp; jjmaccrimmon@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>In the early 90's my (ex) wife and I rented a turn of the last century
(1900) farmhouse at the NE edge of the town of Logansport.&nbsp; I was
assigned at what was then Grissom AFB, the place was a short drive to work.&nbsp;
Little did we realize that the house and the surrounding property (10 acres)
was already inhabited so to speak.&nbsp; The property has three very active
and mostly friendly spirts.&nbsp; There's an older woman, and elderly man
and a young (5-8 year old child).&nbsp; To explain...</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;One morning, we rushed out of the house to make an appointment
in Kokomo.&nbsp; In our haste, we left some plates and silverware out to
dry on the kitch counter.&nbsp; Additionally we'd left the bread undone,
but folded the end under the package.&nbsp; When we returned that evening,
we found the bread wrapped, tied and put away.&nbsp; Additionally the dishes
were put away.&nbsp; Like I said, friendly.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Another evening, we were watching TV in the living room, with
our wolf-dog laying nearby.&nbsp; Aburptly, his head popped up, hackles
raised and a low growl rumbled from his throat.&nbsp; We looked to see
if there was a squirrel or small animal in the darkened dinning room.&nbsp;
To our eyes, the room was empty, but he intently watched something move
across the room heading towards our berdroom.&nbsp; After a minute or so,
he calmed down, but this scene repeated itself several times while we lived
there.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;The basement of the house was "home" to the child.&nbsp; This
spirit stayed close to the stairs and particularly enjoyed hiding tools.&nbsp;
Frequently the tools would reappear stacked neatly at the entry to a small
pump room at the foot of the stairs.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Lastly the property included a large barn.&nbsp; It's residents
included an emnormous groundhog and the elderly man's ghost.&nbsp; While
cleaning out the barn of many years of accumulated debris, muttering and
an occasionally comment/compliment could be heard.&nbsp; Unless the groundhog
learned to speak, I think I was recieving encouragement in my endevors.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Sadly we moved out of the house when housing became available
on base.&nbsp; My wife was expecting and the one and 1/2 bedroom farmhouse
was going to be too small for our needs.&nbsp; According to the USGS aerial
map (1998) of the area, the house and property near the Broadripple Bridge
(CR 450) is still there.</b>

<p><b>i was born and raised in Salem , Ma. I have never seen a ghost and
even though i'm Psychic i don't really believe in most ghost stories and
i'm pretty much a skeptic..but as a child i had a very strang experience
in gallows hill park..which i believe is the real gallows hill though i
am not sure...</b>
<br><b>Anyway...</b>
<br><b>I was about 10 years old...my friend who was REAL weird and i'd
say evil,...claimed to be a witch, or to speak to the dead etc... shewas
my age as well....but of course i never really believed her...thought found
it interesting..Anyway one day at the park...we were out in the feild running
around...and She said something about doing a spell or something spiritual...</b>
<br><b>I went along with anything as i never really believed it.. Well...as
we were playing and running around....I looked behind me..and there were
3 unleashed dogs running full speed towards me..coming from the grassy
feild....they were snarling and i was SO scared oviously that i would get
bit etc i took off running like hell.....my friend didn't run and yelled
what's wrong i kept yelling DOGS DOGS......RUN..but she didn't after i
ran pretty fat and noticed she didn't run all would be safe i looked around
and there were absolutly NO dogs around at all....I have NEVER imagined
or seen anything that wasn't there in my life...So she caught up with me..and
i told her..i seen the 3 dogs running for me...and she said ''oh no the
spirits must be mad, now they're going to make a tornado'' i was like what?!!!!??????
it was a super calm day no wind at all..and ALL of a sudden it started
to get windy..then it got SO windy SOOOOO incredibly windy (of course we
don't have tornados in this area) that it was blowing the sand around from
the baseball area and everyone started running to their cars etc...We ran
like hell away from the place it was SO windy i actually thought there
was going to be a tornado and this was a sudden thing......now that i look
back at it...i sorta seen it as a warning from the spirits or from god

<p><b>Our house was one of the very first dwellings in the Town of Smyrna.&nbsp;
Built in 1792, it still stands strong to this day.&nbsp; The Stokesbury's
have held occupancy for well over 150 years.&nbsp; The first Stokesbury
couple to move in were William A. Stokesbury and Sofia</b>
<br><b>Barnes-Stokesbury.&nbsp; Sofia passed from an illness in the upstairs
front bedroom and we can still catch a glimpse of her walking the hall
from her room to the back of the home.&nbsp; Also, we've heard her walking
up the stairs (which are distinct in sound being hard wood!)in the wee
hours of the night.&nbsp; Lights are turned on in rooms when no one is
in there, doors open or shut on their own as well as door handles being
turned when the door is locked, knocking can be heard in the dining room
(this is recent), cold spots are frequent in the home (we have no window
a/c or central air), orbs are just about an everyday item.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;The house originally a Plantation home and the Stokesbury's
owned much of the sorrounding land which is now the heart of town.&nbsp;
The slaves quarters were back on the hill where St. Polycarp's church now
stands.&nbsp; The old bell in the driveway was rung at mealtime to call
the workers from the fields up to the main house to eat.&nbsp; In the backyard
and also in the detatched garage there has been the dark figure of a tall
thin man seen and felf.&nbsp; Many times at night if you walk in the yard
or into the garage (the "shop"&nbsp; as we call it) you have the feeling
of someone watching you.&nbsp; I have seen the man as well as Sofia several
times and they're not harmful whatsoever, but they do sometimes startle
you when it's dark.</b>

<p><b>the house is on Osbourne road which is named after the family that
died there, the story of the house is described in a movie and book called
"the burning bed" five of us traveled down the road until we found the
house on the west side of the road, the house had burnt down a number of
years ago but still stands. we walked in the front door at 3:30 am, and
explored the little house, to the left in the kitchen there was fridge,
opened, with what appeared like ice in the freezer but we didnt touch it,
there is a trap door that leads to a completely unfinished basement, the
stairs are broken so you can not enter there, the floor to the back room
is completely burned and can not be walked on, there is a room to the back
left side of the house that has no door to it, you can look through holes
in the wall and see beds turned over, you occasionaly hear a light yell
or squeel but, I took a shoe from the kitchen that i still have to this
day, after i put the !little shoe in my pocket My friend and I Doug heard
dragging foot steps, and the ree that stayed in the car said they saw light
on the northern side of the house, but there were no windows there so it
couldnt have been the flashlight, we are going back again soon with camaras
and video recorders to get more documentation,there are no tresspassing
signs, and we were in the house for almost an hour and no cops or anything
showed up so i assume it is ok to explore the house.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Belvidere Theater</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:&nbsp; mike420mayhem@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>This place is something else! I'm 36 years old and have always enjoyed
ghost stories, but this pretty much convinced me that we're not alone.&nbsp;
The town locals had mentioned that it was ironic we were filming a ghost
DVD thriller in the Belvidere Theater due to the haunt legends, but none
of us really thought much about it.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Anyway, I was an actor for the Denver based film and theater
company called Papercat Multi-Media 2 years ago.&nbsp; We were filming
a movie in the Belvidere called "The Monument" in Sept. 2002.&nbsp; Me,
along with approximately a dozen or more other people saw, VERY VIVIDLY
several bright, floating orbs over the inside balcony on at least two occasions.&nbsp;
They appeared to move in patterns of sorts. The 'orbs' or 'balls' looked
about the size of light bulbs and were only apparent in the film monitor,
not to the naked eye. They appeared above one of the producers heads as
he was standing in the camera sight in the balcony the day they were captured
on film. As far as I know, the director kept this footage and is planning
on including it in the final edit of the movie.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Other instances included moving chairs, DRAMATIC drops in
temperature, feelings of not being alone and slamming doors.&nbsp; On one
occasion, the local sheriff was summoned due to a stage door violently
slamming shut (we thought there was an intruder in the theater).</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Anyway, it's all true and I've got scores of witnesses to
back it all up.&nbsp; I just figured we should tell our story, because
it doesn't look like that flick is going to be released anytime soon.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;You can see the theater if you go to Google and look up [Paper
Cat Denver The Monument]&nbsp; I don't recollect the exact web site, though.</b><b></b>

<br><b>University of Tampa, UT Library, and Falk Theater</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:&nbsp; Courtney.E@att.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>I am an alumni of UT.&nbsp; I spent many a day and night in these
3 buildings, plus others on campus that are just as haunted.&nbsp; We'll
start with the University of Tampa:</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; -The second floor is NOT blocked off.&nbsp; All 5 floors
are still in use.&nbsp; The first 4 are classrooms and offices and the
5th is all offices.&nbsp; The servants quarters located on the North side
of the building are used for the sciences, as labs, classrooms and offices
(being a science major, I spent many a day and night there).&nbsp; I have
seen apparitions in windows, heard names being called and footsteps in
the hallways, though I'm the only one around.&nbsp; While in lab, I have
heard people talking in the hallways, though it's after hours and no students
were around.</b>
<br><b>Supposedly, on the 5th floor, someone hung themselves.&nbsp; I hated
to go up there and avoided it if I could, because I didn't like the feeling
I had and because the ceiling is only 7ft tall.&nbsp; Most students and
teachers have had some experiences, especially during the quiet hours of
campus, after 6pm.&nbsp; I've only had e encounter with an unfriendly ghost,
most just want to be known.&nbsp; The history of the building is that it
was!&nbsp; the Tampa Hotel at the turn of the century (built by Henry B.
Plant, the same gentleman who built the Biltmore.&nbsp; He was a railroad
tycoon, in competition to build a railway throughout Fla--he got down to
the Keys and actually built a few of the bridges there).&nbsp; Many famous
dignitaries stayed there, including T Roosevelt, the Queen of England and
Prince of Wales.&nbsp; It was quite the resort.&nbsp; During the Spanish-American
War, it was also used, partially as an infirmary.&nbsp; The building remains
mainly as it looked at the turn of the century, and while I was there,
a boarded up bathroom was found in an english classroom by a student because
he leaned back too far.&nbsp; The bathroom had all original fixtures.</b>
<br><b>Unfortunately, the minarets are only opened for Homecoming Weekend,
however, the view is gorgeous.</b>
<br><b>The library:</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -The Macdonald-Kelce Library was supposedly originally
built as a barn for the Tampa Hotel.&nbsp; Though the barn was torn down
and the library built in its place.&nbsp; While T Roosevelt stayed there
on his way to San Juan Hill, his horses were housed there.&nbsp; You can
hear horse hooves on the cobblestone streets, and stable sounds coming
from the area.</b>
<br><b>Falk Theater:</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; -Falk (not Frank) Theater is home to a female ghost,
who hung herself from the third floor (not abandoned because of structural
issues), right over center stage on a catwalk.&nbsp; She did so because
she caught her lover with someone else.&nbsp; All leading ladies are forbidden
to wear red (and the school takes this seriously... in my 4 years there,
and at least 8 productions later, no leading lady has worn red).&nbsp;
I couldn't stay in back center stage too long.&nbsp; I would move to a
side, while being backstage crew, because I thought something would drop
on me (I was told the story AFTER I worked there for a semester).&nbsp;
Supposedly, the woman the ghost caught wore red, and some past leading
ladies have gotten things dropped on them or near them if they are in red.</b>

<p><b>Pilots Knob - Marion, Ky.</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:&nbsp; jake@streetblast.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Description of Haunting: After reading your website (and obviously
not listening to the disclaimer - but being curtious) - my roommate and
I decided to take a four hour drive from Louisville, Ky. to Marion, Ky.
to visit Pilot's Knob.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;After reading about the "little girl" who was buried in rock,
and was surrounded by crosses - both my roommate and myself grew curious
to see if we could actually find such a location.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Our story begins here.....</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;As we approached the town of Marion (Taking Western Kentucky
Parkway to the Marion exit) - we ventured down US-62 until we came to a
quaint Mom &amp; Pop type of BP Gas station.&nbsp; Inside, we found three
very anxious young adults working behind the counter.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I had a book with directions from MapQuest inside, and I began
to ask (verify actually) the roads with the attendants.&nbsp; A young woman
spoke up and said "your going to Pilot's Knob?"&nbsp; I gave her a glance,
and then smiled.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;She immediately grew very pale and said "I never go there,
noone does - there is a lot of stuff that goes on up there."</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I asked, "Is it safe?"&nbsp; She didn't answer, but she said
that there was a lot of "wise tales" about that place, and since there
was just a cemetary up there - she went once and never ever again.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;A friend of hers came from around the counter, and as if we
were in a Scooby-Doo cartoon said "you both need to turn around and not
go into that cemetary."</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I chucked inside myself, took my directions that I was given
from one of the young men who worked there... and we went on to find Pilot's
Knob.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Venturing down the road (62) isn't that big of a deal, because
it turns into Main St, and kinda vears around a weird turn (we went straight)
to get onto Old Fords Ferry Road.&nbsp; Interesting to note, most of the
townfolk of this area had the last name of Ford, so it was natural that
Fords Ferry would contain "Pilot's Knob," which also contained "Fords"
deceased.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Passing cows, stray dogs, cats, and lots of people walking
and on bikes - we found a road on our right that had a sign "Pilot's Knob
Cem Rd."&nbsp; We turned right, and made our way down the modest gravel
road that leads you up into a hillside that almost swallows you with trees.&nbsp;
The atmosphere is very "strong" in this drive up the hill, the whole area
darkens from the thick cover of trees - the area is quiet, calm.... almost
too quiet.&nbsp; You round a corner, and run directly into a large wooden
cross with reflectors on it and a wire that stretches across the front
of an old cemetary that seems to be flagged with red flags that read "Do
Not Enter."</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Another truck was there when we arrived, and since me and
my roommate purchased two digital cameras for this trip, we decided we
were not going to let other visitors spoil our time.&nbsp; I got out, and
so did my roommate and we crossed over the wire.&nbsp; An elderly man and
woman stood looking at a grave and talking with each other, I smiled and
waved.... it's such a quiet lonely spot, I felt if I didn't wave - it would
be rude.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;They kept staring at us, and finally I said "I'm from Louisville,
it's a beautiful day, and we thought we would visit Marion."&nbsp; The
old lady smiled, and then I made the mistake of saying "We read about this
cemetary on the Internet, and wanted to come check it out."</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Now, understand I did not say "we are here to see the witch
kid and the Watcher ghost."&nbsp; Nor did I say "we are here to do large
amounts of herion and worship the Devil."&nbsp; I just said "we read about
this place on the internet, and wanted to come check it out."</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;The old man grabbed the woman by her arm violently, and said
"no, you can't.... they wouldn't understand."&nbsp; She was about to say
something to us, tell us something... but the old man she was with would
not let her.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;They both walked back to their truck, and drove off.&nbsp;
It was the most bizarre behavior I had ever witnessed, and again - I felt
as if I was in a Scooby Doo episode.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Remember, up until this point the townspeople were almost
"scared to talk about the place," and then the old woman was held back
from telling us something.&nbsp; A big weird town if you ask me.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;It gets much weirder..... as we strolled around the cemetary,
indeed there is a grave with a big iron crossed fence, and it is covered
(I should say lined) with gravel.&nbsp; It is framed (the gravel) in a
vault-like container that goes into the ground [legend says that she is
at the bottom in a steel lined grave covered in rock] - and in the rock
were several small footprints like "pacing" back and forth.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Now, I am a skeptical guy - and yes, I know people get freaky
and try to set stuff up - but there were actual little feet prints in the
gravel rock.&nbsp; Not to mention you can see that the iron bars are pulled
from the inside in a few places, and those bars are so very strong.....
supernatural strength could only mis-shape those!</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;It was getting later, and my roommate and I had to use the
restroom.&nbsp; We decided to leave and come back when it was dark.&nbsp;
Bad move.&nbsp; First of all, that cemetary road looks mighty freakin creepy
in the dark (it's still creepy in the light, btw) and further - it's not
the most fun to navigate when your on edge a bit.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Yes, I was on edge.&nbsp; The town seemed to vanish at night,
and further - noone was brave enough to talk about this spot we were visiting.&nbsp;
No kids were driving by the place, no vandals, no beer bottles, no pizza
boxes.&nbsp; This location was kept clean and vandal free - and there was
no security guard.&nbsp; So, what was it?&nbsp; Indeed, either they have
one hell of a security guard at night or - the town is just smarter than
us city ghost chasing people.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;At any case, our car pulled up and around the winding curve
and the darkened cemetary came into full view.&nbsp; I was aware of the
little girl who was a witch, and knew her grave location.&nbsp; I was NOT
aware of a "Watcher" at this time, so I was not looking for anything outside
of the iron fence.&nbsp; Wished I had been, because this "Watcher" thing
was looking for us - BIG TIME.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I had never seen a ghost, I still have never SEEN a ghost...
but there was something there in that cemetary when we walked up to the
iron fence.&nbsp; There was a large crackling sound in the woods, non-animal
like "you go there" voice and more crackling.&nbsp; Our lights illuminated
the area, but no teenagers or pranksters.&nbsp; We turned to leave the
area, only to</b>
<br><b>now be followed close behind by footsteps (loud thumping kind) and
when we turned, there wasn't anything there.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;My roommate wanted to run, I told him to just stay calm and
walk.&nbsp; I kept thinking "show no fear, walk, keep calm" - inside I
was terrified.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Unfortunately we didn't stick around to see any little girl
materialize, nor did we catch any images of this "Watcher" who we read
about when we got home on your website.&nbsp; I must have skipped the "Watcher"
part, and/or it didn't sink in the first time before we left.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Boy oh boy, I wished it had.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;There is something not right about Pilot's Knob, and whether
town legend or past injustice has caused this - who knows?&nbsp; The only
truth I know is... we were followed by a "thing" that wasn't there.&nbsp;
This "thing" did not want us there, and he didn't want us anywhere near
the little girl's grave.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Pulling out of that cemetary roadway and onto a main highway
was the best feeling in the world.&nbsp; Im sticking to daylight from now
on.....</b>

<p><b>Old Caddo Indian Museum</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:&nbsp; Vitebsk618578@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hello, I am familiar with this place mentioned below. I was quite
surprised to read about this place on your site. I would like to confirm
all information.&nbsp; The museum is located on Hardy</b>
<br><b>Street off of FM1845. (It is closed now for almost 15 years and
is not open to the public) I have seen the little girl myself. Also, several
residents on the street have seen this&nbsp; ghost girl&nbsp; walking threw
the neighborhood at night but she mostly appears in front of the museum
and inside the yard on they museum property behind the gate. Also, I would
like to mention the fact that happened about 1 year ago on this same street.
A young boy also committed suicide by hanging himself in a tree several
houses down from the museum. Hardy Street is not a long street and there
are only a few houses there. Most of the sightings of the&nbsp; little
ghost girl&nbsp; happen in the yard and in the front of the gate outside
of the museum. I have spoken with the neighbors there and also the owner
of the Museum and house next door. He has confirmed there has been many
unexplained things happenduring the years he has lived there. He has also
confirmed as well as his friends and family members there have been many
unexplained instances and (paranormal activity) within his home and on
his property.</b>
<br><b>Several neighbors who live on that street also have a nickname for
the little girl "Dorothy". She seems to be very playful and curious. Her
age is approximately 13-15 years old.&nbsp; Sometimes, you can see the
little girl late at night standing on the street corner of FM1845 and Hardy
Street. This&nbsp; ghost girl&nbsp; has been reported and seen for many
years since 1942. Many people claim they can actually have feelings of
"terror" or "anger" during the late night encounters walking down the street.
They also say, they can hear and "feel" somebody walking behind them during
nighttime walks.</b>

<p><b>The Crown Hotel in Blandford forum England</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:&nbsp; Anonymous</b><b></b>
<p><b>My husband and I were invited to a wedding in Dorset and stayed overnight
in room 24 of The Crown Hotel.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is an old coaching Inn.&nbsp;
I was told in advance the the hotel had one room that was known to be haunted
but was not told which it was or where it was located. As someone who is
very sensitive to such things, I requested that I be placed as far away
from the room as possible and was assured this would happen.&nbsp; Within
fifteen minutes of being in the hotel I had identified the haunted room
plus two other places, the stairs and the corridor outside our room. I
later found out that I was absoloutely right about these places.</b>
<br><b>When we returned from the wedding at about 11pm I had no ideas about
the other hauntings and was confident that I was far enough away from the
spooky room to have an uninterrupted nights rest.&nbsp; The room was very
pleasant though there was a chair in one corner I was not happy about.&nbsp;
I was fine until the light was turned off. Soon the floorboards started
to creak and we both heard heavy footsteps that come through&nbsp; the
door across to our bed underneath the place where our heads were resting.&nbsp;
Then they stopped.&nbsp; The room became exceedingly hot, and I was filled
with an overwhelming feeling of terror such as I have never experienced
in my life before.&nbsp; The foot steps were heavy enough to vibrate but
not shake the bed however my husband felt neither the vibrations or the
terror I was experienced.&nbsp; This sequence happened on and off until
about one thirty in the morning and the fear remained throughout.&nbsp;
At about half past one in the morning I suddenly became very calm though
I still felt very uncomfortable in the room.&nbsp; The heat remained until
about 4am though the central heating was turned off because it was summer.
I am used to seeing people who are dead, it frightens me but does not cause
me to feel such intense terror. I did not see anything because I was too
afraid to look and kept my eyes tightly shut.&nbsp; I wonder has anybody
else been affected in this way when staying at The Crown Hotel in Blandford
forum?&nbsp;&nbsp; The ability to see and hear things others don't runs
through my mothers side of the family.&nbsp; My youngest daughter has it,
I have it,my mother had it, her mother had it and mothers great grandfather
I am told was a famous victorian clairvoyant.</b><b></b>

clock turn from 11:59 to 12.&nbsp; I looked at the front window and there
was a man standing there.&nbsp; Ok someone might be looking in?&nbsp; No
the windows were so high that you would need to be on a ladder to look
in and this guy was standing where I could see his whole body.&nbsp; He
then started to disappear from his head down.&nbsp; Didn’t think much of
it… tho ht it was pain killers.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Until the next year I fell asleep in the front room and woke
up in the middle of the night.&nbsp; I started to pick up the blanket I
had used looked up at the VCR to see it blink.&nbsp; Okay our VCR was messed
up it didn’t blink 12:00 like normal VCRs do it just stayed on.&nbsp; I
thought maybe it was our cat had walked in front of it, but then remember
I had put them up for the night.&nbsp; I stood up and turned around only
to be stared down by the hazy simi glowing dark red eyes… ice ran through
my veins.&nbsp; I ran out of that room not turning back to check and see
if it was still looking.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I then mentioned something to my mother and step-father only
to find out in August they had there own run in mid day.&nbsp; They were
sitting in our dinning room which my bedroom door is off of.&nbsp; All
the doors were shut to help keep the main part of the house cooler.&nbsp;
My step-father said he watched the door knob turn and the door open.&nbsp;
My mother describes the feeling like someone opened a freezer.&nbsp; My
step-father got up and closed the door. Only for it to reopen when he set
down.&nbsp; He said “Go away” and the door shut.&nbsp; My step-father left
the house refusing to ever go to the house again.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;We sold the house about nine years ago.&nbsp; I still fear
that house and hate driving by it whenever I go back to that town.</b>

<p><b>Hi, My name is Tim Mitchell,I use to work at Holden 22, I use to
haul coal off the mountain where Mamie was supost to have been killed.
One night in august i started through the gate on top of the mountain,
coming off the hill to the truck dump, where i believe Mamie rode off the
hill with me, to the bottom,. when i passed through the gate on top of
the hill, I began to shake in a violent chill it felt like it was below
0, and my eyes watered so bad i could hardly see to drive. This lasted
til i got to the foot of the mountain, then stopped as fast as it started.
I told the guys on the strip job what happened and they said it was Mamie.
It turns out that i live right across from where Mamie lived when she was
living on Stratton St. in Logan WV, today.I have seen ghosts at holden
22 also, Among other places i have worked. I do believe in ghost, The house
that i live in has a spirit in it also, I have seen and heard it.</b><b></b>

<p><b>By: minstrelofavalon@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hello, I thought I'd share an experience that my girlfriend and I
shared not</b>
<br><b>long after I moved into her life-long home with her. Apparently,
over the</b>
<br><b>years, she's felt a presence in her house. Particularly in her dining
room,</b>
<br><b>she feels rather uncomfortable in here so it's fallen into disuse.
During</b>
<br><b>joyous occasions and holidays, she's sworn she's heard a child's</b>
<br><b>giggle/laughter. She'd always suspected it was the spirit of a sibling
that</b>
<br><b>she would have had, except sadly, it was stillborn. I make no claims
as to</b>
<br><b>having heard laughter or the like, but I too have felt that presence
and</b>
<br><b>have made some interesting connections, which I'll explain next.</b>
<br><b>One night in the last couple of weeks, she and I were standing on
the porch</b>
<br><b>stargazing and talking quietly. Behind us, in the family room, a
few notes</b>
<br><b>of "Hark, the Herald Angels Sing" played, and she suddenly looked
rather</b>
<br><b>spooked. She led me back into the house and showed me a wind-up
music</b>
<br><b>box/snow globe and explained that's what had made the sound. Except
that it</b>
<br><b>hadn't been wound for years. Now, I'm not a skeptic, but anyone
knows that a</b>
<br><b>little vibration is all it takes to squeeze a few notes out of a
music box</b>
<br><b>that still has some tension from its last wind. So I sort of dismissed
it.</b>
<br><b>(I'll mention that the cabinet which this music globe sits on shares
a wall</b>
<br><b>with the dining room in which we feel uncomfortable.)</b>
<br><b>So, a few nights later, after this had been weighing on my mind,
I asked if</b>
<br><b>I could wind it up. Getting the go-ahead to do so, I did. One turn,
and</b>
<br><b>nothing. Two turns, and nothing still. Three, and it remained silent.
It was</b>
<br><b>broken! I told her and she got a little worried, so I decided to
examine it</b>
<br><b>further. I set it down and stepped back to take a picture of it,
to see if</b>
<br><b>anything would turn out in the photo (orb, mist, etc). As I did,
it made a</b>
<br><b>single "ding" at me. I turned it over and found that the bottom
was somewhat</b>
<br><b>uneven with the frame, as if it'd been dropped sometime in the past.
So, I</b>
<br><b>took it apart carefully and was shocked to find that the cylinder
with the</b>
<br><b>knobs on it had come loose and was not anywhere near the keys at
all. It is</b>
<br><b>impossible that it could have made that ding, let alone played its
song a</b>
<br><b>week previous. It'd been broken and untouched years previous.</b>
<br><b>At this point, I'd begun to suspect it was being manipulated by
a spirit for</b>
<br><b>some reason. So I inquired what significance the object might have.
Her</b>
<br><b>mother told me it was a baby-shower present for the baby that was
stillborn.</b>
<br><b>I didn't mention my suspicion of it, and just acted as though I
was curious.</b>
<br><b>I put it back together carefully and replaced it. I feel as though
perhaps</b>
<br><b>it's not a good thing to play with.</b>
<br><b>If you have any thoughts on the subject, you might let me know and
I'd</b>
<br><b>appreciate it.</b>
<br><b>Ps. I also have taken pictures of the dining room and this corner
of the</b>
<br><b>family room and have captured a couple of orbs in the affected area.</b>

<p><b>Haunted House - Wellington, KS</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: MarilynHudson@msn.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>In 1966 we moved into an old farm house just off of HY 81&nbsp; of
Wellington.&nbsp; It included an enclosed chicken yard.&nbsp; One of the
upstairs bedrooms soon became a store room because of the strange cold
that was always there and the feeling of being watched when you were in
there.&nbsp; The sound of footsteps could be heard going down the hall
to stop at that door.&nbsp; At night the sound of the gate from the main
yard to the chicken yard could be heard to open and close (it was old,
heavy, rusted metal and leaned, making a distinctive dragging sound when
ever it was opened).&nbsp;&nbsp; I watched one moonlit night as the sound
of the gate being dragged open carried clearly over the night and there
was enough moon to show that there was no one there.</b>

<p><b>Ghosts Watch over the Dying</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Rosemarie.Finlay@cornell.edu</b><b></b>
<p><b>My aunt was diagnosed with terminal cancer, and decided that she
wanted to go into a hospice (basically a place for terminally ill people
to die in peace without the fuss of doctors or hospitals).&nbsp; The only
ongoing medical care that is given at a hospice is by nurses who give medication
to ease pain and to make things more comfortable.&nbsp; My aunt went into
the hospice in the summer of 2003, but the doctors weren't too sure how
long she had to live.&nbsp; My mom would visit her every night, and would
talk to me every once in while over the phone about stuff she had experienced
second-hand.</b>
<br><b>My aunt would see a female "angel" who would come and comfort her,
and she would see various people come into her room; people who were not
there.&nbsp; She would describe these people to my mom (who of course didn't
see them), but it made her feel good.&nbsp; My mom talked to the nurses
at the hospice and they reported that they would see people who weren't
really there, and hear from patients stories about hearing beautiful symphony
music that would stop once the nurse entered the room.</b>
<br><b>Since my aunt was so ill and couldn't really be moved, we decided
to get the family together to have Thanksgiving dinner at the hospice.&nbsp;
There is a large multi-purpose room on the bottom floor, with a kitchen
right off of it.&nbsp; Of course because it was a family occasion, we took
lots of pictures, which I really didn't get to see until I loaded them
on my computer later on.&nbsp; The room wasn't at all dusty (I have bad
allergies and I definitely would have noticed), and in some of the pictures
the spots disappear, so it doesn't seem that dust was on the lens.</b>
<br><b>After we had dinner, my mom took me and my husband and brothers
up to my aunt's room so I could see what it was like.&nbsp; As soon as
I stepped off the elevator I had this overwhelming feeling of peace, but
definitely felt a presence there.&nbsp; It made me feel a lot better that
she had people on the other side to comfort her in her last days. She passed
away at the hospice this past April.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Cat Ghost</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: birdwatcher@globalecinc.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I had a cat that use to love to go outside and run around, and everytime
she wanted to go back inside, she would climb the steps of the deck and
scrach the door. Well, a month after she died, I noticed small cat pawprints
in the mud leading up to the steps of the deck, and ending there. A little
while after that, I found muddy cat paw prints on the stairs of the deck
going up to the deck, then ending when they got to the door. a couple months
after that I was downstairs watching the t.v. when I looked out of the
window, and saw a cat (that looked just like her), climbing the steps to
the deck. My first reaction was that is was a poor stray looking for food,
so I ran outside and up the steps behind the cat. But when I got up to
the deck, there was no cat. I looked around the furniture, ran back down
the steps, looked in the back yard, but found no trace of the cat anywhere.
It's been about a year since she died, and I'll often have the feeling
of her whiskers, tikeling my leg, but everytime i look, there is nothing
there. I'll also have slight sightings of her out of the corner of my eye,
and sometimes when I'm in my bed, I'll feel her jumping on my bed, and
will even feel the vibration from her purring.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Cocoa Village, Florida</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: arphie@cfl.rr.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I resided within this complex for about a year, first in an efficiency,</b>
<br><b>then in one of the one bedroom apartments, both on the same floor.
I've</b>
<br><b>always been a little 'sensitive' to spooky things, but the entire
complex</b>
<br><b>was subject to one particular oddity towards the end of my stay
there.</b>
<br><b>A panic knocking came to the door one night. We opened it to someone
trying</b>
<br><b>to ask if we had something burning. The hallway was filled with
white</b>
<br><b>smoke, though there was no smell. It clung to the upper level of
the</b>
<br><b>hallway for about five minutes while I went to call the Fire Department.
By</b>
<br><b>the time I was done with the call the 'smoke' had all but faded.
Before the</b>
<br><b>Fire Dep arrived, it had come back again and had started to fade
once more.</b>
<br><b>I knew it wasn't smoke, though I thought perhaps it was a water
heater that</b>
<br><b>blew and was filtering steam. I got the chance to walk down the
hall,</b>
<br><b>towards the back part of the building and was bent on figuring it
was</b>
<br><b>steam. No one ever figured out what happened, what caused it, to
my</b>
<br><b>knowledge. It was just really creepy to not see the other end of
the hall</b>
<br><b>one moment, then things be perfectly normal in the next, only to
repeat</b>
<br><b>itself. There was no odd smell, nothing sticking to clothing from
moisture.</b>
<br><b>About three years later, I related this and other experiences I'd
had to</b>
<br><b>someone who said they also lived there. I was informed the place
had caught</b>
<br><b>fire a number of times in its history. I don't know the validity
of this,</b>
<br><b>but apparently I gave this guy chills by mentioning the 'smoke'
incident.</b>
<br><b>Next, we exchanged experiences with bug infestations. He had trouble
with</b>
<br><b>tons of flies along his windowsills that would just be gone the
next day</b>
<br><b>without him sweeping them up. I had issues with subterranian ternmites.</b>
<br><b>(Yeah, on the second floor.) One night, they seemed to just come
out of no</b>
<br><b>where. We'd seen a few here and there ever since we moved in, but
the</b>
<br><b>swarmed one night. After that, we never really had issues again.</b>
<br><b>When I moved into the one bedroom apt, I'd go to sleep, cabinets
closed,</b>
<br><b>only to wake up to anywhere from 2-4 of them opened during the night.</b>
<br><b>Then there was the other hallway experiences.. Many times I would
swear I</b>
<br><b>saw someone down the hall, towards the back of the building. I'd
turn to</b>
<br><b>look and see what looked like a human's shadow fading into the wall
next to</b>
<br><b>wear it stood. On another occasion, I was returning from a smoke
on the</b>
<br><b>fire escape to go back in and this shadow-thing did this no less
than two</b>
<br><b>feet in front of me. (This made me wonder about my prior notions
that the</b>
<br><b>hallway just had a strange light effect towards the back part. the
fire</b>
<br><b>escape, however, was on the side, down a short second hallway.)
My</b>
<br><b>boyfriend at the time saw the figure a number of times as well,
and was</b>
<br><b>there the night of the smoke, and experienced the non-too-pleasant
invasion</b>
<br><b>of ternmites.</b>
<br><b>The 'spirit' felt to both me and my boyfriend to be a male presence.
I felt</b>
<br><b>it seemed 'curious' but my boyfriend had argued that he felt as
if it just</b>
<br><b>didn't like him. Eventually, the malicious feelings he was getting
from it</b>
<br><b>went away. If going by the shadow, the spirit seemed of average
adult</b>
<br><b>height, perhaps a little on the short side, average frame. Seemed
to stand</b>
<br><b>up straight when not seen already halfway into the wall. The most
sharp</b>
<br><b>edges wear around the head and shoulders, then faded to be barely
noticable</b>
<br><b>at the waist. You'd never see the legs. Most of the time, he was
seen</b>
<br><b>towards the back of the hall, though at times he'd be as far as
the middle</b>
<br><b>of the hall. (There was/is a curious 'lump', like a speedbump, under
the</b>
<br><b>carpet in the middle. I'd only seen him passed it once, that night
on the</b>
<br><b>fire escape.</b>
<br><b>I know this is getting long, but I have one more weird experience
from</b>
<br><b>living there. One night, my boyfriend and I had a spat while living
in the</b>
<br><b>smaller apartment. (Small space, go fig we'd have a spat. ;>) I
needed to</b>
<br><b>go sit somewhere by myself for a while and let off some steam. So,
I exited</b>
<br><b>our apartment door and went into the hall. There are stairs at both
ends of</b>
<br><b>the hall. I went for the closer ones down to the first floor, then</b>
<br><b>proceeded to the back of that hallway. At the end of it, was another
set of</b>
<br><b>stairs leading out to a lower exit. (Technically, I was on the second
floor</b>
<br><b>at this point but there were shops under the 'complex' itself.)
No one even</b>
<br><b>hung out at the bottom of the lowest level stairs, so thats where
I went.</b>
<br><b>Once I cooled down a bit, I went back to talk to my boyfriend and
make</b>
<br><b>things better without all the heated emotional crap. He looked at
me when I</b>
<br><b>got back in, asked where I'd gone and told me he'd gone looking
for me</b>
<br><b>because he was worried. He then informed me he went to the back
of our hall</b>
<br><b>first, then down the stairs and also checked the bottom stairs,
where I</b>
<br><b>actually was. I wasn't seen by him at all but he did tell me that
he saw</b>
<br><b>other people in the other hall. I tld him i did as well, as I passed
them.</b>
<br><b>It was very strange.</b>

<br><b>Ghost Story</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: larrypowers515@MSN.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>It is my belief that my house is haunted.&nbsp; Certain places in
my house have always freaked me out (particularly the dining room, my room,
and occasionly the basement esspecially the back rooms.)&nbsp; First I
find this to be something creepy, I didn’t not know this until after I
started telling my mom about strange things happening but when I was three
I once claimed I had seen a little boy in our dining room(the by far scaries
room of our house) and that he knew my grandpa(who had not much earlier
died) but it was only once that I saw him.&nbsp; Now onto the things that
makes me believe that my house is haunted.&nbsp; I first suspected it one
night when something very weird happened.&nbsp; It was about 10 o'clock
in my dining room when I was on the phone.&nbsp; Some weird banging noise
came out of the phone and I heard something behind me.&nbsp; I turned around
and out of the corner of my eye in the window I saw my own reflection and
something else behind me running past me.&nbsp; I went completely cold.&nbsp;
The phone went instantly back to normal and I left that room and called
back my friend and he claimed he was disconnected.(I still get chills thing
about that time.)&nbsp; It was not for monthes that I told anyone the story
of that night.</b>
<br><b>When I did finally tell the story it was when I had three frinds
spent the night(ryan,mitch, and austin we're there names.)&nbsp; I told
them and we walked into the dining room and got terrified.&nbsp; Mitch
got freaked out enough to pick up a cross that was on the ground lean it
against the dining room table and say something like be at peace and go
or something to that effect(he had more experience with this then I did
because his old house was haunted.)&nbsp; We left the room but were spooked
the rest of the night.&nbsp; We had to turn on music videos and try to
calm down.&nbsp; That was it for that night but this wasn’t done for me.&nbsp;
They could let it rest but I couldn’t in my oy own house.&nbsp; I was incredibly
interested in this paranormal activity in my own house but still not quite
sure that it was all real.&nbsp; The next time convinced me for sure.</b>
<br><b>The next time I had people spend the night was just ryan and mitch.&nbsp;
Mitch and brought a digital camera so we could try to get pictures of anything.&nbsp;
After taking pictures for a while we realized the area around a lamp was
black(not just dark but litterally black) we took about 4-10 more pictures
all turning out the same way(I would have given the pictures but unfortunatly
his father deleted them from the camera.)&nbsp; Then standing by the small
enterance from the kitchen(the other is large and from the front door)
the camera just died being on full batteries.&nbsp; We kept charging the
batteries to full and walking through the same spot did this about 5-7
more times that one night.&nbsp; Once Ryan said he felt something grab
the weight of the camera and just drain the energy from his hand and then
the camera died. The windows in that room were all fogged up.&nbsp; Parts
of the room were so cold that just by walking through them you would come
out shaking.&nbsp; Other stang things that night were this plant fell over
twice and we thought we saw a shadow run across our family room.&nbsp;
I was terrified so much I didn’t want to walk through the kitchen to get
to the bathroom but I did anyway.&nbsp; And out of not the corner of my
eye but more of to the side of it still in fairly good eyesite.&nbsp; At
first I thought it was my dog.&nbsp; It was either a dog or a raggy child
dressed in old dirty clothes. That was it I stayed in my family room the
rest of the night and curled up and wouldn’t leave that room.&nbsp; After
that whole night I was convinced something wasn’t right about that room.</b>
<br><b>The next morning Mitch left early and it was just me and Ryan.&nbsp;
A friend of mine was on-line(her name is jenni) and gave me the idea or
trying to make these metal things out of a hanger (dousing rods) that detect
ghosts by points to them and crossing over there exact position. The last
time ryan said he saw the shadow of a human figure on the wall behind me
but I did not notice it. Every time we did it(about five times) we found
in slightly different spots but relativly the same area. always over a
chair or couch.&nbsp; I also tried it in my room and found that there was
nothing until I put it over my bed and it crossed(o great I've been sleeping
on a ghost! I thought)&nbsp; as ryan was leaving the same plant which had
fallen over before did so again, but this time no one was in there and
I dared not enter the room and fix it alone so I left.&nbsp; So I sat in
my house terrified for a good portion of the day until my mom and sister
returned home.</b>
<br><b>By the way I should also mention that at Ryan's house ghosts have
been seen and before he got a pssword lock for his garage door it would
open on it's own.&nbsp; His mom has claimed to see a little girl holding
a candle and other strange things like the tv being turned on the front
door slightly open and things moved about but nothing gone when they returned
home.&nbsp; And matt (another friend) has seen ghosts in his house and
had doors open.&nbsp; His grandparents have also seen them.&nbsp; They
both live just across the street from me.&nbsp; Mitch's new house is normal
and just down the street roughly 10 houses down.&nbsp; His old house was
very strange but a story better told by him then me.</b>
<br><b>Also twice I've heard dogs sniffing me when my dog was once aleep
in another area of the house and another time on a completely different
floor.</b>
<br><b>I should mention that me and my friends are all 14(except for matt
and ryan who are 13)and not crazy or paranoid.&nbsp; Really weird things
happen around her that you just can't explain the feeling you get when
it happens.&nbsp; Scary but the addrenalin rush is amazing.&nbsp; Please
tell me what you think.</b>

<br><b>clairsentient I am finding out (didn’t know the word for it), and

<br><b>I never felt comfortable walking in the main auditorium or downstairs;

<p><b>My Experiences This Summer</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Chev4171@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Just this summer my family and I visited Tombstone Arizona.&nbsp;
I had heard all about the famous birdcage theater and I had to see it.&nbsp;
My sister and I took a tour throughout the theater and expierienced something
very odd.&nbsp; When we went downstairs to walk through the area where
the rooms were that the girls used to "do their business" My sister and
I were both looking into the room and suddenly I was frozen, I couldn't
move.&nbsp; My sister then saw the items on the dresser move around and
when she turned to look at me she said I was extemely pale and looked like
I was going to faint.&nbsp; I can only describe the feeling I felt as well
it felt like someone passed though me.&nbsp; All of this would seem strange
but it all happened at the same time.&nbsp; The feeling I had and that
of my sister.&nbsp; I have always believed in ghosts, having lived in a
home that we were told my many people was haunted. In fact a priest actually
said that it was the first time he felt "unsafe" in a home and that he
couldn't bless the house.&nbsp;&nbsp; But this was the first time that
it actually scared me. I will never forget that feeling.</b>

<br><b>House Haunting?</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: ryan_loftis@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hi, my name is Ryan&nbsp; and I have a few stories about a house
that I lived in with my parents and two younger brothers from 1994 until
1998 in Mt. Prospect, IL.&nbsp; Alot of weird things happened in this house
that we absolutely could not explain and honestly, really didn't want to.&nbsp;
LOL.&nbsp; It's weird, you hear all of these ghost stories from people
and it scares the bejesus out of you, but when it happens to you, you really
aren't that scared.</b>
<br><b>First story:&nbsp; The Blinds</b>
<br><b>One day after school in 1996, I was a freshman in high school.&nbsp;
My younger brothers, Chris, 14, and Josh, 7, and I just arrived home from
school on a typical cold Northern Illinois November afternoon.&nbsp; We
always, as most kids, would get home before both of our parents after school.&nbsp;
Chris, Josh and I got home and we were doing normal kid things after school...
TV, food, homework.&nbsp; Well around 4:30 p.m. we settled in finally in
the living room downstairs for some R &amp; R around the TV.&nbsp; I remember
I was sitting in the large lounge chair, and my two brothers were on the
couch while I controlled the remote.&nbsp; The setup of the living room
was simple, there was a large bay window about 7 feet long and about 4
tall which took up most of wall with long vertical blinds that almost touched
the floor.&nbsp; The blinds were open so we could see our back yard because
it had been snowing most of the day and we liked to watch the snow fall.</b>
<br><b>While we were watching TV a little argument broke out because me
being the oldest I got to control the remote and pretty much watch what
I want, LOL.&nbsp; While we were arguing for some reason we all had our
attention drawn to the large bay window at the same time and we experienced
one of the many craziest things we've ever seen.</b>
<br><b>At the exact moment we looked we saw a dark image fly across the
bay window moving extremely fast.&nbsp; We would've put this out of our
mind normally, but as the dark "blob" moved across the window it moved
the blinds rocking them violently.&nbsp; We all shut up for a second and
looked at each other in disbelief.&nbsp; I jumped up quickly and ran outside
to the back of the house where the bay window was so I could peer in where
my brothers were.&nbsp; I search the snow covered ground to find no foot
prints.&nbsp; I came back in, sat down and said,"Well that was weird and
I have no explination, so let's just ignore it."&nbsp; We did so, but that
was just the beginning of many more things.</b>
<br><b>Finally, I told my father of the incident and to my surprised he
was not surprised.&nbsp; He went on to tell me a few other stories of things
that were happening in the household that he chose not to tell us.</b>
<br><b>My father, in his late 30's at the time, had been in a bad car accident
in 1995 and was forced out of work for a long period of time because of
chronic back problems from the accident.&nbsp; He spent most of his time
in the living room watching TV waiting for his back to recover from the
eventual 4 back surgerys.&nbsp; He told me of this one story that to this
day makes me cringe because my bedroom was the center of attention for
this happening.</b>
<br><b>The White Faced Man</b>
<br><b>In the fall of 1997, my father was still recovering from his back
surgeries and was home alone except for our Brendle Pitt-Bull dog that
we received after my uncle passed away in January of that year.</b>
<br><b>It was another typical fall early afternoon in the Chicagoland area.&nbsp;
Bright and sunny, chilly with a hint uneasiness in the air.&nbsp; This
part of the story is hard to explain without pictures but I will try to
the best of my ability.</b>
<br><b>The way the living room is set up at this time is a little different
than the previous story.&nbsp; When you walk into the back door of the
house you walk into the kitchen which has two entrances.&nbsp; As soon
as you walk in the house you can go right into the dining room and follow
the wall, on your left, to the living room.&nbsp; At the end of the wall,
you turn left and the TV is set in the center of that wall.&nbsp; To the
right of the TV is the second entrance to the kitchen.&nbsp; As soon as
you walk into that entrance you can make a right into stairwell that leads
to the basement, which is where my bedroom is located.</b>
<br><b>My father had a moveable chair he liked to sit in while his back
was messed because it made his back feel good while resting.&nbsp; He had
the chair placed directly in front of the TV in the living about 6 feet
away.&nbsp; My father being a avid gun collector had his prize handgun
sitting in his lap because he just finished cleaning it while watching
TV.&nbsp; Also, our Pitt-Bull name "Piggy" was laying at his feet while
he watched TV and cleaned his gun as she always did.&nbsp; While my father
was flipping through the channels he happened to look down at Piggy and
noticed her attention was fixed on the the stairwell going into the basement
and began growling.&nbsp; My father being an extremely cautious man grabbed
his gun immediately and put his attention to her and was saying,"What is
it, girl?"&nbsp; "What's wrong?"&nbsp; After a few quick que ions he looked
up at the stairwell and there was a man with an ice white face and long
black curly hair (like that of Slash from Guns n Roses) crouched down on
the stairs, looking around the corner, smiling as if he was playing with
the dog.&nbsp; As soon as my father jumped up, gun in hand, the man flipped
his hair back, grunted loudly and ran down the stairs.&nbsp; My father
ran after the man he thought was an intruder downstairs only to find there
was absolutely no trace of the man.&nbsp; He searched the bathroom and
the utility closet, where the water heater was, and under bed only to find
nothing.&nbsp; He double checked the windows to make sure they were secure
and their security was confirmed.&nbsp; He stood there in the middle of
the basement wondering what had just happened and realized we live in a
haunted house.</b>
<br><b>If you have any questions or want some more of my accounts, I have
many more.&nbsp; Just e-mail me here.&nbsp; Thanks.</b><b></b>

<p><b>The Last Farewell</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: kreck12@comcast.net</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>When I was a youngster, I always loved to hang around with my grandfather.&nbsp;
He was a surly old guy who cussed, chewed, spit and smoked, all of the
great attributes of a young boys Grand-dad.&nbsp; He was in his late sixties
when I was born, as a matter of fact, my wife was born on his 64th birthday.</b>
<br><b>We used to do a lot of things together, we fished, farmed in his
little acre garden, fixed his old motor boat and went fishing in the Absecon
bay behind Atlantic city, chewed tobacco and smoked a pipe.&nbsp; He would
keep me enthralled with his stories of when he was young.&nbsp; He was
a real story teller, and some of them were not too flattering to say the
least.&nbsp; I loved that old guy.</b>
<br><b>As long as I could remember, he smoked his pipe, whether he was
watching TV, farming his garden, working around the house, whatever he
did, his pipe was always in his mouth, whether it was lit or not.&nbsp;
He started me smoking one of his pipes at the ripe old age of 12.&nbsp;
He smoked so much, you could tell when he was around because he reeked
of the sweet smell of stale tobacco.</b>
<br><b>When he reached his 90's, he was reluctantly placed in a senior
home, since he became uncontrollably senile and could not take care of
his bodily functions.</b>
<br><b>At this time, I was married, a father, and in the Army, stationed
in Arizona, some 2,500 miles from Pennsylvania where he was living.</b>
<br><b>I remember getting the call on October 30th, 1969 .&nbsp; It was
my Dad who told me that Grand-dad had passed.&nbsp; During the call, he
urged me to come home for the funeral, but I was still in the Army and
had no money for the trip, plus my wife was a week overdue for the birth
of our second child.&nbsp; There was no way I could go.</b>
<br><b>Two days later, the day of the funeral, my wife, who was still hanging
around as we called it, and I were planning to play cards with the next
door neighbors, another Army couple.&nbsp; When I went into our bedroom
to get the cards from the dresser,</b>
<br><b>I was stopped dead in my tracks when I entered the room.&nbsp; I
hastily asked my wife to come back into the room to find the cards.&nbsp;
When she entered, I asked her, do you smell anything.&nbsp; She looked
at me astonished and said&nbsp; yeah..your grandfather.&nbsp; That sweet
stale tobacco smell engulfed the entire room, and I hadn't smoked a pipe
in years.&nbsp; We checked the windows, they were closed to keep in the
air conditioning.&nbsp; There was no place that smell could have come from,
except from him.</b>
<br><b>To this day, we never forgot that last farewell.</b>

<p><b>Foosball</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: kheadley@Route24.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>My wife and I raised four kids while living in a haunted house for
twenty years. The kids were small when I bought the house at a public auction
from an estate. This was a big old house built around 1918. It was two
stories with walk in attic and full basement. The perfect home for our
family.The kids grew up with ghostly experiences. At first they didn't
realize that the weird things that happened were caused by ghosts. Many
things happened over the twenty year period but I will just touch on a
couple of them. We had a recreation room in the basement.</b>
<br><b>I purchased a coin operated commercial Foosball table and put it
on free play. Our son was&nbsp; sixteen at the time and had a few friends
over one evening. They gave the Foosball game quite a workout. They closed
thev rec room and came upstairs for refreshments. They were sitting around
the kitchen table when they heard this loud crash in the basement. They
all ran down to the rec room and turned on the lights. There was the heavy
Foosball table upside down in the middle of the room. It took all of them
to set it upright.</b>
<br><b>The two older girls were married and had moved into their own homes
when this other incident occurred. We always traveled for several weeks
during the summer and locked the house. As usual, when the girls moved
out, our attic was where their excess baggage was stored. One of the girls
wanted something from the attic while the house was locked. Knowing&nbsp;
the house was haunted, she didn't want to go up there alone so the two
girls went togerher.</b>
<br><b>They made the trip to the attic by the back stairway and came back
the same way. As they passed by the upstairs bathroom on their way back,
both faucets were running full stream in the bathroom sink. They shut them
off and hurried down the back steps to the kitchen. There were the faucets
in the kitchen sink runnung full stream. They turned them off and as they
exited the kitchen they had to pass the gas stove. All four burners were
burning on high. They turned them off and left very quickly.</b>
<br><b>This is just a sample of the twenty year's events that we lived
with. After the kids all moved out we sold the house and bought one with
everything all on one floor. The people living there now have not experienced
any unusual activity.</b>
