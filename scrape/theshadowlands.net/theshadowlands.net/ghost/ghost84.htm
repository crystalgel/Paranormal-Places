</H3><P>
<P><B>By: yolandav2@yahoo.com</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B>When I was a child I was always afraid.  In the daytime a sound or</B>
<P><B>something would trigger visions in my mind that scared and confused
me</B>
<P><B>and at night I would be awaken by sounds from sluggish foot steps to</B>
<P><B>high pitched whistles or low tones with caused a vibration around me.
</B>
<P><B>I even experienced a tug war with something that wanted to pull my</B>
<P><B>blanket off me.  But for the first few years I could not see anything</B>
<P><B>that my other senses felt until I as around 10 years.</B>
<P>
<P><B>When I turned 10, I was given my own bed.  We were a poor family of
8</B>
<P><B>in a 4 room home.  Our 4 room house had only a front door and a side</B>
<P><B>door but there were  no doors inside.  It had arched openings from
one</B>
<P><B>room to another and one could see from one room to another.  The
house</B>
<P><B>was made of cement blocks in a perfect square.  My mother, 3 younger</B>
<P><B>siblings and myself slept in one room and in one bed until I was 10.</B>
<P><B>Our room was south and 2 brothers slept in the north side our room
and</B>
<P><B>east from our room another brother slept.</B>
<P>
<P><B>My grandma gave me an army cot which was placed where I could see my</B>
<P><B>brother from the north and see my mom's bed next to our entrance. 
One</B>
<P><B>summer night I was awaken by some low vibration.  I just felt</B>
<P><B>something.  I remember my heart pounding and wishing I was in bed
with</B>
<P><B>my mom and brothers and sister.  I could not move. I was able to turn</B>
<P><B>my head to look at the entrance to our room from the north.  I saw
a</B>
<P><B>white figure gliding slowly in.  It was like looking at a negative</B>
<P><B>photo film. I shutted my eyes to see if it would disappear but when
I</B>
<P><B>opened them again it was still gliding in.  I could not see any legs</B>
<P><B>and I could tell it was a man dressed in a suit.  I could not see his</B>
<P><B>face but I could tell the darkness of where his eyes were and he was</B>
<P><B>looking around.  He stopped in front of the bed where my mom and</B>
<P><B>brothers and sister were sleeping.  That's when I pulled my sheet
over</B>
<P><B>my head because I was so scared it would know I was awake.  I prayed</B>
<P><B>and prayed until I finally went to sleep. </B>
<P>
<P><B>Next morning I talked to my mom about it.  She told me it was
probably</B>
<P><B>a dream but I knew better.  I made my sister sleep with me and I put
a</B>
<P><B>chair with a towel beside my bed so I would never have look at the</B>
<P><B>entrance.  Shortly around that time, my mom received a telegram that</B>
<P><B>her father in Mexico had died.  It was mentioned that he died asking</B>
<P><B>for her.  Years later she told me that when I told her what I had
seen</B>
<P><B>that night, she was dreaming about her father.  That she and he were</B>
<P><B>walking on this long lonely road and that she has gotten too tired
to</B>
<P><B>go on.  He told her to sit by the road and rest but he could not
stop,</B>
<P><B>he needed to go.  I guess it was him who came that night. I never saw</B>
<P><B>him again.  We lived in Texas so he came from so far away.</B>
<P>
<P><B> Athens OH</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: ap860096@oak.cats.ohiou.edu.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Firstly, I live in Athens Ohio, which is said to be extremly </B>
<P><B>spiritual/haunted.  Around the city are cemeteries that make a pentagram
in </B>
<P><B>an arial viewing.  We have an old insane asylum which was built in
the </B>
<P><B>1800's, that was completely self sufficient and therefore cut off from
the </B>
<P><B>rest of the town, it sits high atop a hill, and when it was in use,
had its </B>
<P><B>own power supply, water supply, food supplies etc.  Behind the facilities
is </B>
<P><B>a particularly sad cemetary that stretches into the surrounding brush.
 The </B>
<P><B>cemetary consists of small rectangular head stones that have only numbers
to </B>
<P><B>distinguish one grave from another.  I have never witnessed any phenomena
</B>
<P><B>ther, but I have never visited the grounds at night.  There is a lot
of </B>
<P><B>feeling there, but no specific cases.</B>
<P><B>    Outside of the Ridges (the asylum), I have had my share of
experiences</B>
<P><B>in Athens.  My freshman year, I lived in a dorm where a dear friend
refused to </B>
<P><B>sleep in her room because a spirit would constantly turn her stereo
on and </B>
<P><B>of, blaring, in the middle of the night.  I had no idea about the mists
or </B>
<P><B>orbs that are seen in some of the pictures in your website, but she
had a </B>
<P><B>picture with a grayish mist hovering over her head as she sat in her
bed.</B>
<P><B>    I now live in a house in Athens, and have had a few subtle instances
of </B>
<P><B>ghosts. I have heard heavy footsteps in the upper level, enough to
make me </B>
<P><B>call out to my house mate to see what she was doing, no one was there
as I </B>
<P><B>heard a door open and shut that leads to a porch with no way down except
a</B>
<P><B>10 foot drop.  My shower curtain has opened and shut on its own, something
has </B>
<P><B>entered the kitchen from outside, opening the door, turning on the
light,</B>
<P><B>and then off, and then shutting the door, when all of my housemates
and I where </B>
<P><B>concentrated in one room.  A male voice has been heard coming from
the </B>
<P><B>downstairs bathroom, keys have disappeared without a trace, only to
leave me </B>
<P><B>ready to tear my hair out as they reappear in an obvious location,
that was </B>
<P><B>already checked.  I am not sure, but I read that one of your web people
has </B>
<P><B>electromagnetic surges, our electricity goes out as much as five times
in</B>
<P><B>one day, much to the electric companie's dismay and confusion (as I
call and </B>
<P><B>complain weekly), and our phones ring with no one on the line regularly.
 I </B>
<P><B>am sure that there are reasonable explanations for all these things,
but I'm </B>
<P><B>not convinced.</B>
<P><B>    I know my story is pretty tame compared to many that you have likely
</B>
<P><B>received, but it is still interesting.  If you know anything about
Athens,</B>
<P><B>or if you have studied here before, I would love to hear from you.
 I am a firm </B>
<P><B>believer in the supernatural, as I have two particular friends who
are </B>
<P><B>exteremly sensitive to this phenomena, and have amazing stories of
their</B>
<P><B>own. </B>

<P><B>Charlesgate  </B>
<P>
<P><B>By: Pam Tapia </B>
<P>
<P><B>I don't know how much you can add to the brief description but there
is more than I listed. First</B>
<P><B>of all, you have to see this place, a gothic victorian castle-like
structure it was built as a </B>
<P><B>hotel which served as a brothel. In the lobby there are large tiles
surrounding a mantel which </B>
<P><B>feature little naked babies frolicking with phallus shaped dragons.
The original sign is a </B>
<P><B>carving over the beacon street entrance which reads simply Charlesgate
with little demons poised</B>
<P><B>among the letters.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The place was known for all forms of prostitution, female, male and
unfortunately child, and was </B>
<P><B>a haven for turn of the century heroin and opium addicts. It was closed
down and seized by the </B>
<P><B>state and was turned into housing for the poor and destitute. There
was a gas leak and many of </B>
<P><B>the families perished, so apparently there are spirits of children
existing among the spirits of</B>
<P><B>prostitutes and drug-addicts. Emerson College bought the place in the
70's and converted it into</B>
<P><B>a dormitory primarily for freshmen. Reports of sightings became so
common that a team of </B>
<P><B>parapsychologists came into investigate and film. Story has it that
when they filmed in the lower</B>
<P><B>basement, known as the stables, they captured the spectres of horses
standing in their stables. </B>
<P><B>Who knows what else they caught on film because fearing bad publicity
Emerson College confiscated</B>
<P><B>the films.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Emerson had some pretty strange policies concerning the residents.
A fire drill was called and </B>
<P><B>he building manager addressed the group telling them that a search
of all rooms was going to be </B>
<P><B>conducted and anyone found in posession of a Ouija board would be expelled.
If a resident had a </B>
<P><B>sighting that became known to the RAs they were summoned to tell their
story to the manager who </B>
<P><B>would recommend them for psychiatric examination. Many students had
nervous breakdowns while </B>
<P><B>living there each year and had to drop out. </B>
<P>
<P><B>What were they seeing? The spirits were not friendly specters that
dissapeared upon examination </B>
<P><B>but rather persistent and rather solid in appearance. There were plenty
of stories of sightings,</B>
<P><B> but I believed the ones told by the simple and trustworthy kids I
knew were not interested in </B>
<P><B>such things, and of people who were positively freaked out by what
they saw:</B>
<P><B>* The old sea captain, a short bearded old man, often appeared in the
closets of young girls. </B>
<P><B>* The witch who lived there in the 60's who appeared surrounded by
a circle of candles (like the</B>
<P><B> horses in the stables, more of an impression than a spirit) </B>
<P><B>* The dandy, GGF, a notorious male prostitute/junkie who persistently
haunted freshmen until they</B>
<P><B> either became suicidal or dropped out of school altogether. </B>
<P><B>* The flapper whose disembodied head hovered in one room on more than
one occasion staring down </B>
<P><B>the residents. Her eyes would leap out like two balls of light at the
terrified witnesses. </B>
<P><B>* The blue specter, just a human like form of blue light which hovered
eerily in darkened rooms. </B>
<P><B>* Some elemental spirits, you might call them, or demons as they are
known in Hollywood: </B>
<P><B>* A piglike very solid-looking critter that was known to simply sit
on the bed in one room </B>
<P><B>staring down the witness. </B>
<P><B>* Two humanoid solid-looking mail imps that peformed sexual acts on
each other in mid-air in full</B>
<P><B> lighted view always staring down the witnesses. </B>

<P><B>Colorado Stories</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: DDDacko@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>Hi my name is Denise and I have had quite a few experience's. My first
</B>
<P><B>experience was when I was 9. Two of my brothers shared a best friend
and his </B>
<P><B>name was Robbie, Robbie had got killed pushing his bike on a busy
street</B>
<P><B>by a drunk driver. Of course my family was devistated because he was
always at</B>
<P><B>our house, and he was treated as part of the family.The incidents followed
his </B>
<P><B>death.  My sister and I shared a room, she had a full size bed that
would </B>
<P><B>creak if you sat on it, and I had a twin bed right across from hers.
In </B>
<P><B>between the two was a old metal table that would creak if you leaned
on it. </B>
<P><B>Well anyways, I had gotten up around 9 am and was brushing my hair
in the </B>
<P><B>mirror, and I heard  the table creak. I thought one of our cats was
in the </B>
<P><B>bedroom so I ignored it.</B>
<P><B>Just a few minutes later, the table creaked again, so I looked to see
if it </B>
<P><B>was one of our 2 cats. Still nothing there. I looked and the bedroom
door</B>
<P><B>was shut. I sluffed of the second incident and thought I heard it all.
Just a</B>
<P><B>few moments later I heard the bed creak, so I looked in the mirror
and I saw the </B>
<P><B>bed had a sag in it like someone or SOMETHING was sitting on the edge.
Now I </B>
<P><B>knew I was seeing things. So curiosity got the best of me and I sat
on the </B>
<P><B>sag. The weirdest of feelings went through me at the moment I sat on
the</B>
<P><B>sag. </B>
<P><B>I looked across to my bed and whatever and whoever ( I assume it was
Robbie) </B>
<P><B>went and sat on my bed. Needless to say I was out of there very quick,
I </B>
<P><B>didn't want to stick around to see what happened next.</B>
<P><B>//////////////////////</B>
<P><B>Shortly after that incident my dad had told me to go get my brother,
who had </B>
<P><B>a trailer on our property, maybe 300 yards away from our house. We
had a old </B>
<P><B>garage in between the house and trailer, the garage didn't have no
garage </B>
<P><B>door on it and it was very spooky at night. So it was night out, and
you </B>
<P><B>always done what my dad told you to do. I was scared of the dark as
a child, </B>
<P><B>so I stood on the back porch to find a path I could take. It was night
time, </B>
<P><B>but there was a full moon out. So I didn't get to freaked about it.
We had</B>
<P><B>10 acres in the country and my brother lived within the fenced 9 of
them. I had </B>
<P><B>just walked past the gate, and I heard footsteps like somebody was
running</B>
<P><B>up behind me. I thought it was one of my brothers trying to scare me,
but I </B>
<P><B>turned and look while I still heard them, and no one was there except
for</B>
<P><B>the shadow of someone on the house, that wasn't there in body only
in spirit.</B>
<P><B>   I had numerous experiences like these for six years up until my
parents </B>
<P><B>seperated when I was 15. when I finally moved away with my mom.</B>
<P><B>/////////////////////</B>
<P><B> More incidents was after my brother-in-law had commited suicide. I
was </B>
<P><B>staying with my sister in the mountains to help her deal with the loss.
I</B>
<P><B>was 21 at the time.</B>
<P><B>My brother-in-law killed himself in the house. One night my sister
had</B>
<P><B>wanted just to get away for a little while, so I stayed to watch my
nephew. It was </B>
<P><B>around 11 pm my nephew was asleep in his upstairs bedroom. I was doing
the </B>
<P><B>dishes before I went to bed, and I felt a cool breeze on the back of
me. I </B>
<P><B>thought one of the windows were still open even though I had closed
them all </B>
<P><B>earlier. So I looked at the dining room and no windows were open there,
and </B>
<P><B>as I walked down the hall to the living room, I could still feel the
breeze. </B>
<P><B>In the hall there are no windows. I had the feeling come over me again
as my </B>
<P><B>first experience. As I was walking past the stairs that lead downstairs
I </B>
<P><B>heard footsteps coming up, needless to say I didn't want to know what
was </B>
<P><B>coming up. All I knew was it didn't feel right. So I stayed in the
room with </B>
<P><B>my 3 year old nephew until my sister got home, and everything was
fine.</B>
<P><B>Shortly after that incident, I was sound asleep and it was about 1
am, I</B>
<P><B>woke up and I was wide awake, I looked at the bedroom door that was
closed and I </B>
<P><B>could see a blueish light on the door and within the bluish light was
my </B>
<P><B>brother-in-laws face. I was not scared at all. I knew then, like he
told me </B>
<P><B>telepathically, that things are going to be allright. After that I
fell</B>
<P><B>right back asleep.</B>
<P><B>////////////////////</B>
<P><B>One last story. My dad had passed away in 1993, and I am now a jeweler.
2 </B>
<P><B>weeks after he had passed away, I was polishing some jewelry on a buffing
</B>
<P><B>machine. I was in the studio. I was standing and I had a old bar
stool</B>
<P><B>that I use to sit on next to me. I heard it creak, like someone had
sat in it. So I </B>
<P><B>asked "is that you dad?", and I thought I was crazy for asking such
a silly </B>
<P><B>question. I had a overhead lamp on and left it on as I went over to
my desk </B>
<P><B>to finish the fine detail. My husband came in and he was in the room
with me </B>
<P><B>for about 5 minutes. The lightbulb above my buffing machine had shattered.
</B>
<P><B>The same feeling came back to me from when I was young.</B>
<P><B>I knew it was my dad. My husband does not believe in ghost and he says
that </B>
<P><B>the light was just a bad bulb. But of course I think otherwise. I have
many </B>
<P><B>more stories to tell but I don't want to bore people. If anyone can
explain </B>
<P><B>why the light bulb shattered please e-mail me at DDDacko@aol.com. Thanks
for </B>
<P><B>listening :)</B>

<P><B>Many Scary Experiences</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: Bogie39999@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>I've had quite a few, at least I think so, not being familiar with</B>
<P><B>others encounters....I have encountered my grandfather, a witch on
a spinning</B>
<P><B>wheel, an indian, ( many years later my brother woke up one nite and
saw an indian </B>
<P><B>standing over me when I was asleep...he jumped out at the indian who</B>
<P><B>vanished into thin air)....I lived in a haunted house where there were
crashes in the </B>
<P><B>night, voices...in a language I did not understand until later I found
out </B>
<P><B>the words meant hello in that language that I did not speak....I lived
in an </B>
<P><B>apt where I woke up one early morning to see a young, somewhat crazy
lookin </B>
<P><B>boy demonstrating to me how to hang himself with a tie?...he had a
funny </B>
<P><B>smile and hung his tongue out of the side of his mouth as he tugged
the tie </B>
<P><B>that he had put around his neck.....many times...just as I am falling
</B>
<P><B>asleep...I will be awakened by a "swishing" sound ...like a spirit
is </B>
<P><B>speeding past me......</B>
<P>
<P><B>Now..dont get me wrong...I work in an engineering environment.....but
these </B>
<P><B>things did indeed happen.....this of course is over a 40 plus year
</B>
<P><B>timespan....these things do not happen on a regular basis...but I have
come </B>
<P><B>to the conclusion that spirits do undoubtedly exist..some very </B>
<P><B>friendly...some a little not so friendly.....I think some of them watch
over </B>
<P><B>you.....while others, the minority..like to create unpleasant effects
on </B>
<P><B>you.....</B>
<P><B>I also believe one is more "in tune" to the spiritual world while in
a </B>
<P><B>relaxed state...ie just prior to falling asleep, or when
asleep........</B>
<P>
<P><B>Ghost Phone Call?</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: NJac934162@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>I have been reading your site and I must say I'm impressed. However,
I don't </B>
<P><B>know if what happened to me would or could be considered anything "ghostly"
</B>
<P><B>but it definately got my attention as well as that of my bosses.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>I work for a labor organization that represents over 200 employees.
 Part of </B>
<P><B>my job is to handle death benefit claims for the members who pass away.
 I </B>
<P><B>had a member that died and his widow came into my office to find out
about </B>
<P><B>benefits due her.  Imagine her surprise when she was expecting some
</B>
<P><B>outrageous amount of 90,000 dollars and we all she was entitled to
was</B>
<P><B>2,000! </B>
<P><B> The widow, upon hearing this became enraged and a bit of tussle occurred
 </B>
<P><B>(nothing physical just yelling  and such). Well after attempting to
explain </B>
<P><B>to her that at no time was anybody entitled to that amount of money
and she </B>
<P><B>had obviously been  misinformed (her fault-not ours) she threw some
papers </B>
<P><B>off my desk and stormed out.</B>
<P>
<P><B>As soon as she left I went into my own tyrade about how rude she was
(much </B>
<P><B>more colorful though) and basically mimicked her immature hissy fit.
I</B>
<P><B>ranted </B>
<P><B>for a good five minutes, then my phone rang....  </B>
<P>
<P><B>It sounded like someone was calling me from an airplane.  It was a
hollow </B>
<P><B>sound and I could just make out someone calling my name and every hair
on my </B>
<P><B>body stood straight up.  I hung up the phone and turned to my boss
making </B>
<P><B>some smart alec remark about I had overstepped my bounds by argueing
with</B>
<P><B>and then ranting about what a witch the woman had been and her husband
"heard"</B>
<P><B>me and called me to let me know he didn't appreciate it.  Mind you
I was not </B>
<P><B>kind to her and espeically not behind her back after she threw my
paperwork. </B>
<P><B>I remember making a remark like "no wonder John died, I'd have died
too to </B>
<P><B>get away from her".  The phone rang again. This time my boss answered
it. </B>
<P><B>Same thing; tunnel noise, the faint calling of my name and the noise
like </B>
<P><B>someone was being sucked back in time.   the only thing i can figure
is John </B>
<P><B>must of loved his wife a lot in life and felt the need to defend her
in his </B>
<P><B>death.  Could've been a bad connection, my gut tell me it wasn't. </B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>Picture from the Bible</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: "Robin Cole" </B>
<P>
<P><B>As a young child i often stayed at my grandmothers house in the holidays
( west midlands UK ) . </B>
<P><B>I was always really bored on my own and usually messed about, breaking
things etc. Anyway I threw</B>
<P><B>a ball at a picture of my great grandfather , cracking the wooden
frame(accident, really ). As a </B>
<P><B>punishment I was not allowed to go with my mum to the local shops,
and was left all alone in the</B>
<P><B>house. I sat watching telly for about half an hour when I noticed that
the picture had turned </B>
<P><B>around a good two inches to face me. Fearing further retribution, I
turned it back around, not </B>
<P><B>thinking anything of it. </B>
<P><B>The next morning I came down to brekfast, I had had a late start to
the day and ate on my own.</B>
<P><B>It was after breakfast that I noticed the picture had again turned
to face me, this time having</B>
<P><B>moved a good six inches. I never spent another night in that house
( day trips only ).</B>
<P><B>I was really scared ( being only 11 at the time ) and told my grandma
about this bizzare </B>
<P><B>occurance. She put it down to an over-active imagination, but did tell
me a bit about the photos</B>
<P><B> history. Apparently it was the only picture she had of my great
grandfather, having lost the </B>
<P><B>rest whilst moving house. She found this picture tucked away in a copy
of the old testament. </B>
<P><B>I also learned that my great grandfather recieved a fatal shrapnel
wound on the western front in</B>
<P><B> WW1, at roughly the same moment that my grandfather was born. Curiously
enough he had suffered </B>
<P><B>alarming headaches frequently until the day of his death.</B>
<P><B>I was only reminded of this all when my grandmother passed away a few
weeks ago, leaving many </B>
<P><B>questions unanswered . To this day a do not know if my experience with
the photo was the </B>
<P><B>punishment of an agonising soul, or just the wild imagination of an
adolescent boy. </B>

<P><B>Ghost?</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: Clare.Aliberti@wl.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>We recently purchased an 1850 carriage house (we have been in the house
for</B>
<P><B>a little over a month).  The first few weeks we were in the house I
felt as</B>
<P><B>though there was someone near me and everytime I started to turn to
look I'd</B>
<P><B>see a shadow out of the corner of my eye.  I didn't mention it to my
husband</B>
<P><B>(felt a little foolish) but he happened to mention that he experienced
the</B>
<P><B>same thing when he was in the cellar.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Then when I was in the barn replacing the nails with screws in the
floor the</B>
<P><B>overwhelming smell of livestock was so strong that I had to go outside
for</B>
<P><B>some fresh air - A few minutes later I re-entered and there was no
odor</B>
<P><B>whatsoever (there hasn't been any livestock there for nearly 30
years).</B>
<P><B>That odor hasn't returned since.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Now here's the reason why I'm writing to you....Last night I had some
very</B>
<P><B>terrifying nightmares (I don't usually have dreams and when I went
to bed I</B>
<P><B>was exhausted), anyway, I awoke with a start to find this man standing
in</B>
<P><B>front of my husband's armoire smiling at me - He wasn't surrounded
in a</B>
<P><B>cloud of smoke or little beams of light...I can still see him (Red
hair,</B>
<P><B>bushy red mustache, plaid shirt).  I didn't feel threatened, don't
remember</B>
<P><B>feelings of cold (like everyone seems to say they feel).  Anyway, my
husband</B>
<P><B>doesn't believe in the paranormal and said that my brain could have</B>
<P><B>projected the image (is this possible?!).</B>
<P>
<P><B>On a last note, I'm 41 and consider myself fairly clear headed and</B>
<P><B>reasonable but this whole experience leaves me a little unsettled.
 To make</B>
<P><B>matters worse a friend of mine told me that they use to bury their
dead in</B>
<P><B>the cellar in the winter months (Is this true?).  I didn't venture
down the</B>
<P><B>cellar before this statement because it was so cold - Now I'm real
leery</B>
<P><B>about going down there!.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Anyway, the house is a very warm inviting house and I love it -</B>
<P><B>Unfortunately I'm a little scared now.</B>

<P><B>Gram's Visit</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: melissa@languageline.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>I just wrote yesterday but one of your stories reminded me of something
I</B>
<P><B>was told by my natural mother. My natural sister (also adopted at birth)
and</B>
<P><B>I met mom in May of 82 and visited separately her home in Reno. My
mom had</B>
<P><B>been caring for her blind mom and uncle (our great-uncle) for some
years -</B>
<P><B>bad eyes run in the family and she was responsible for them as her
father</B>
<P><B>died when she was 9 and her older sister had married and moved out
of the</B>
<P><B>family home soon after. Well needless to say she was not really very
sure of</B>
<P><B>how to break the news of two grown daughters to her family and so for
the</B>
<P><B>first while (until Dec 82) when we visited we were just friends up
for a</B>
<P><B>visit. The only people who really knew who we were - were my Grandmother
and</B>
<P><B>Great-uncle Bob. Once the family knew who we were there was a reunion
of</B>
<P><B>gigantic proportions where we got to know all of our cousins, uncles,
aunts</B>
<P><B>etc and as we got to know every one bonds started to develope. Well
a couple</B>
<P><B>of years went by and my natural sister moved up to Reno and got a house
and</B>
<P><B>job there. My sister and mom got together alot as my sis has Lupus
and I</B>
<P><B>think just needed to know someone was there if she needed them. They
have a</B>
<P><B>very close relationship and Gram was a part of that. When Gram passed
on in</B>
<P><B>early 1988 - it was a very stressful time for our family. And this
is where</B>
<P><B>the story begins. Gram had a favorite chair that faced the "picture"
window</B>
<P><B>in the living room. One night when everything had "settled" down and
the</B>
<P><B>decisions regarding Gram's estate had been made. My sister was outside
next</B>
<P><B>to a tree that was in the yard asking mom where she wanted her to plant
some</B>
<P><B>flowers (I think) and mom sitting in the chair next to my Gram's
favorite</B>
<P><B>chair looked up to see Gram's reflection in the window. Mom called
out "Do</B>
<P><B>you see what I see?" to my sister. Sis came up and looked through the
window</B>
<P><B>once she realized that mom was not talking about something outside
and could</B>
<P><B>not see anything. So Mom asked her to come in for a moment. Mom had
looked</B>
<P><B>directly at Gram's chair and could not see her except when she was
looking</B>
<P><B>into the window. Sis came in and said "I can't see anything." To which
mom</B>
<P><B>replied "Come over here honey and look at the window." When she did
she</B>
<P><B>could see Gram smiling in her chair and then Gram just faded away.
As far as</B>
<P><B>I know they have never seen her again. She probably just came back
to let</B>
<P><B>them know she was okay and happy where she was. I know that even though
mom</B>
<P><B>doesn't live in that home anymore and even though she doesn't even
have the</B>
<P><B>chair her mom's presence is there in times of stress or trouble because
she</B>
<P><B>feels she is with her.</B>

<P><B>Grandma comes to Visit </B>
<P>
<P><B>By: "Lewis Foster" </B>
<P><B> </B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>I submitted this once before then changed internet servers so it was
never posted.</B>
<P><B>Its a story that I have been wanting to tell for many years to people
who will</B>
<P><B>believe me.</B>
<P><B>When my son was still an infant I believe I had a visit from my
grandmother.</B>
<P><B>In life her and I were very close. we did alot together. I use to call
her my</B>
<P><B>marshmellow because she was so soft.</B>
<P><B>One night after an extremely hard day with my son I put him to bed
and wound up</B>
<P><B>his night light. It was one of those dream screens they use to sell.</B>
<P><B>I turned on the monitors and went to bed. I always stayed awake til
it was done</B>
<P><B>playing because he had a habit of not falling asleep right away.</B>
<P><B>When it stopped and I was sure he was asleep I drifted off. I was startled
back</B>
<P><B>awake by the sound of twinkle twinkle little star coming through the
monitor.</B>
<P><B>I layed there for a few moments listening, til I heard my son gurgling
and cooing.</B>
<P><B>I got up and started down the hallway still hearing the music coming
from his room.</B>
<P><B>When I got closer to his room I started feeling a warm comfortable
feeling surronding</B>
<P><B>me.</B>
<P><B>I started crying as I went in his room because I felt something warm
and soft surround me.</B>
<P><B>My son was laying in his crib playing and talking up a baby storm.</B>
<P><B>I just stood there while the music from the dream screen ran out almost
in disbelief.</B>
<P><B>when the music stopped the feeling went away.</B>
<P><B>I picked my son up and said "what did you think of your great grandma
sweetie"?</B>
<P><B>Yes I checked the dream screen to make sure he didnt start it by kicking
it with</B>
<P><B>his foot or something. I shook it and rattled it but nothing
happened.</B>
<P><B>I very much believe that my grandmother came to visit us that night
to see the</B>
<P><B>great grandchild she missed in life.</B>

<P><B>By: "JAMES R HUEY" </B>
<P>
<P><B>I have to share atleast one more eperience except this one is my mom
and grandpa's experience. </B>
<P><B>My mom is 38 now but when she was about 17 and still living with my
grandpa, about 6 months after</B>
<P><B> her mom (my grandma) died they were feeling a prescense in the house.
They said when she was </B>
<P><B>still alive, right before bed she would eat butter on crackers. One
night they heard something </B>

<P><B>Haunted Hallway</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: bzebe@hotmail.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>I was about 7 or 8 years old. Two of my sisters and I were all sleeping
in </B>
<P><B>one room becasuse we all had this feeling that we didn't want to be
alone. I </B>
<P><B>was on the edge of my bed and my room was right across the hallway
from the </B>
<P><B>bathroom. I was laying down and it was about 2:00 in the morning and
I </B>
<P><B>though that my sisters were asleep. I was gonna get out of bed to go
to the </B>
<P><B>bathroom when something told me to stay in the bed. I didn't want to
listen </B>
<P><B>to it so I started to get up but then something pushed me back down
and kept </B>
<P><B>me there. I couldn't move and I couldn't speak. I was trying to make
just a </B>
<P><B>little noise to wake my sisters up but nothing came out. I wanted to
close </B>
<P><B>my eyes but I couldn't move my eyelids either. Then all of a sudden
I </B>
<P><B>watched a very tall, skiny figure with a white glow around it walk
through </B>
<P><B>the hall and into my other sister's room. The room it walked into was
the </B>
<P><B>sister that wasn't sleeping in my room. The next day I was talking
to my </B>
<P><B>younger sister and it came out that she saw the same figure. Then my
older </B>
<P><B>sister that was in the room with us walked up and asked us if we saw
the </B>
<P><B>tall man walk into Jennifer's room. I thought I was dreaming but that
</B>
<P><B>confirmed I wasn't. We all went and found Jennifer and asked her if
there </B>
<P><B>was anyone in her room the night before. She said yes and described
the tall </B>
<P><B>white glowing man to the "T". So we all saw it so we ran to our mom
and told </B>
<P><B>her what happened. She asked us who it was and we told her we had no
idea. I </B>
<P><B>am 18 now and still talk about it with my sisters and family. We still
don't </B>
<P><B>know who the tall man was.</B>

<P><B>Haunting in Maine</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: becky@skow.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>Hi!  My name is Becky.  I live in Central Maine.  To put it bluntly,
I</B>
<P><B>live in a haunted house!  It's a very long and twisted story, but
i'll</B>
<P><B>try to explain it the best I can.  The house was built in the</B>
<P><B>1840's....but I have a feeling that this house has been here since
the</B>
<P><B>late 1700's.  It's a typical farm house, built by a Quaker colony
that</B>
<P><B>settled in this area.  The house has 3 additions.  The front half</B>
<P><B>(facing the road) is the original, both upstairs and down.  The
second</B>
<P><B>half was built in the 1930's (which is both upstairs and downstairs</B>
<P><B>kitchens) around that time is when the upstairs was divided into a</B>
<P><B>separate apartment from downstairs.  Then the back half is where the</B>
<P><B>bathrooms are located and the stair well.</B>
<P>
<P><B>There have been hauntings here well before I came to live here in
1995.</B>
<P><B>My boyfriend's family has lived here well over 50 years and has seen,</B>
<P><B>heard, and felt spirits living here.  I think one of the eeriest
things</B>
<P><B>is that when I come home from somewhere, and I head upstairs to our</B>
<P><B>apartment, it feels like i'm walking into someone else's home, like
I</B>
<P><B>don't belong there...</B>
<P>
<P><B>I have had several encounters with the spirits that live here.  From
my</B>
<P><B>own experiences, i have seen three different spirits.  One is a
little</B>
<P><B>boy, whom i only saw once.  Second is a young man, average height,
dark</B>
<P><B>hair and wearing a dark suit.  The third, and by far the scariest,
is</B>
<P><B>the Farmer.  He is a rugid older man, somewhat long silver hair,
wearing</B>
<P><B>overalls and a long sleeve shirt, and is very angry.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The majority of the sounds that I hear are a husky man laughing, a</B>
<P><B>pocket watch ticking, footsteps, knocking on our door.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Things that i have seen:  dark shadows in our kitchen, a dark shadow</B>
<P><B>pacing in our kitchen one morning!  A coffee table in our living room</B>
<P><B>shaking.  Little objects missing, such as necklaces, little bottles
of</B>
<P><B>shampoo/conditioner, cigarettes, cups/papers being in one place when
you</B>
<P><B>leave, and then coming back and finding them in a different place.</B>
<P><B>By far the most terrifying experience i've had is I was taking a nap
in</B>
<P><B>the living room, I felt something wake me up...I felt this pressure
all</B>
<P><B>around me, it felt like I was putting weight on my chest and side.
I</B>
<P><B>couldn't fully wake up, and all I remember saying is "Leave me alone,</B>
<P><B>get off of me, you can't scare me".</B>
<P>
<P><B>I am in the process of trying to take some photographs of this house,</B>
<P><B>and see if anything "develops".  I have also been in touch with a</B>
<P><B>reverend about religion matter, especially in ridding the house of</B>
<P><B>spirits, if that's possible!</B>
<P>
<P><B>But I also want to say this is a truly excellent site!!  It's really</B>
<P><B>reassuring to know that me and my boyfriend's family are not psychos!</B>
<P><B>And this kind of thing happens alot.</B>
<P>
<P><B>A couple of questions i do have is: 1.  What is the best way to take</B>
<P><B>photographs of spirits, and when is the best conditions to take</B>
<P><B>pictures?  2.  Is there any way of telling if you have a good or bad</B>
<P><B>spirits in your house?  If so, can they effect a person in
particular,</B>
<P><B>like if they're depressed or upset?</B>
<P>
<P><B>Thank you sooooo very much for your time and the opportunity to tell
my</B>
<P><B>story and I truly truly believe in the supernatural, and of course
the</B>
<P><B>paranormal!!!</B>
