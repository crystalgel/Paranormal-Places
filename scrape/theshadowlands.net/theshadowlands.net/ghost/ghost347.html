<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">My
best friends mom just died last weekend, and I've<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">been
helping her go through all of her things, to get<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">them
out of the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her mom wanted her to
keep<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">everything,
and not throw anything away, but she kept<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">telling
her that it was impossible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So we were<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">getting
started, and I was putting Easter decor. away<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">and
I needed a trash bag, and so my friend got me one<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">and
set the trash bags in front of thier fish<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">aquarium.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then while we were going through her<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">clothes
we needed trash bags for things that weren't<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">donatable,
so I went to go get the bags and they were<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">gone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We looked everywhere in the house, top to<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">bottom
and couldn't find them, so we had to go buy<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">more.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then the next day we stopped back at the
house<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">to
get the boxes of clothes, and my friend left her<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">keys
in the ignition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After we got all of the
boxes<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">loaded
up we couldn't find the keys.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
retraced her<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">every
step, looked under the seats, in all of the<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">boxes
at least 5 times, in every floor of the house,<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">under
furniture. And then she said"mom just give me<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">back
the keys, they're not even mine." Then she looked<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">under
the driver's seat one more time (we both looked<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">a
combined 7 times under that seat).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
there they<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">were,
and they were in a place that if she'd dropped<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">them,
or they fell out of the ignition, it was<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">impossible,
it couldn't of went down the side either. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Her
mom didn't want her stuff donated, and she was<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">trying
to stop it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">my
story begins when i lived in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt;">ohio</span></st1:place></st1:State><span style="font-size: 14pt;"> </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt;">USA</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 14pt;">. I was driving back to my
house one day with my friends when i saw a girl visiting a graveyard. She was
right at the top by a statue of an angel. The girl looked very young about 11
years old. She was wearing old fashioned clothes. I went up to the grave the
next day. The inscription was writen on the angel's bible. It said In Memory of
****** ****** died 1832-1845 died of tuberculosis. I did not use the girls name
for her respect. I now realized that yesterday i had seen a ghost. I can see
the grave yard from where i live and i always see a girl visit the grave. One
time i went up there to see if I could catch a glimse of the girl. This time
she was bending over two other graves. I went away because i thought the girl
was starting to sense my presence. I came back though and found the two graves.
These two were her mother and father. They had died of tuberculosis too.I
looked like no one came and took care of this grave so i would come up there
sometimes and clean the graves. When i had finished cleaning the girl's grave
one day i looked up and saw the girl watching me. She was smiling. She followed
me home. I wasnt bothered because i knew she was harmless. It was almost like
she was an old friend. I have lots of alphabet magnets on the fridge. I was
upset that the girl had gone (she left soon after coming) i went to the fridge
to get some food. The magnets were spelled out and it read
"thankyou". All the ghost of the girl wanted was someone to pay
attention to her family's graves.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The
Ranch<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">By:
jfoster7497@sbcglobal.net<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">For
years the ranch my grandpa owns has beent the center of many disturbing
experiences. Though I did not experience them first hand, I am going to tell you
some real stories about this place. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Now,
I'm going to start with this ranch was built on an Indian burrial ground... Or
this is what my mom tells me. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">My
mother, Grace Tietje, lived there with her dad, sister, and two of her
brothers. They only lived there part-time, they lived in </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt;">San Luis Obispo</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style="font-size: 14pt;"> with my grandmother. They'd
go to the ranch on weekends along with my Grandfather. My Grandmother would
stay behind because she hated the ranch. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">On
the fourth of July, my mom had her friend come over (and this is when they were
older, maybe in their 20's) and she let her stay in her bedroom with this guy
she got close to. So my mom ended up on the couch. In the middle of the night,
she sat stright up, like in the horror movies, where people sit straight up all
the sudden in the middle of their sleep. She had no clue why, but she was
scared to death. She started looking around, and out of no where, she started
seeing little dashes and whisps of silver light. They would fly right over her
and there would be deep whafts of cold air. She got up and ran to the bedroom.
The guy my mom's friend 'got close to' worked at the ranch as a gardener and
had had experiences like this before seeing he'd worked there a long time. He
said he thinks it is on an Indian burrial ground, but couldn't be sure. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">When
my mom was young, not such great things happened at the ranch. I only know of
one, but I'll tell you about it. My grandpa would bring wierd friends that he
met to the ranch. Their was one guy in particular who came, and ever time he'd
play a game where all the boys including my Uncle's freinds would have to play.
It was basically a hide-and-seek game, but when he found them, he would pretend
to torture them, and he'd throw them in a pool (which definantly wasn't a
pleasent thing). <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">My
Uncle Martin was so scared of this guy, and he had good reason. This man was an
old Vietnam War veteran. You could pretty much call him crazy. My Uncle spent
most of his days at the ranch preparing for when he came. He did not want to be
found. He had a place ready on this tree with a little stash of candy bars and
packet drinks and a ladder that he could pull up after him. When the man came,
he found everone but Martin and looked for him till it was well past dark. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Finally,
he found him, but he wouldn't come down, and didn't. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I
had lived at the ranch for about six months, and my mom was scared to death of
it, so we moved. (My dad had lived with us) There was no power, so matches were
common. After we had moved, my mom's younger brother, Nick and his wife
Shelley, moved in. They had my little cousins Larry, the oldest, Amanda,
second, and Monica, the youngest. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">My
cousin Larry had gottten ahold of matches when he climbed out of the crib he
was in with Amanda. He climbed back in and started a fire not knowing the
cosequences, being as young as he was. My Aunt Shelley was upstairs taking a
nap with Monica, and my Uncle Nick was at work. Shelley came running out of the
burning building and left Monica outside, running back in to get Larry. It was
too late for Amanda, and they still have her ashes. Larry lived but he has 3rd
degree burns that have scarred him permanantly. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">My
Uncle divorced Shelley due to other problems in thier marriage. He got
remarried to another woman named Tracy and together, they had a child named
Kaitlyn Elizibeth. Just a while ago, they figured out she was deff.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">My
grandpa lived at the ranch regularly till he broke his back. He was riding his
horse on a mountain by a steep ravine. Being an experienced rider, he didn't
have much of a risk factor. No one knows what, but something spooked the horse
and he fell off, down the ravine and broke his back. Now he is in a wheel
chair, and he seems like he'd rather die, than not be able to live at the
ranch.So far he is not there, but he is trying to get there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Another
bit that interested me about my family's ranch is that it tore my mom's side of
the family apart. There have been endless fights about it and pretty much
everyone is turned away from eachother. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">All
these things coincedence? I don't know, but I find it hard to think of it that
way.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

Dorm Room<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I
went to Santa Catalina Summercamp, but it was also a bording school.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">For
some reason, there is one room that is never open for borders. It's at the end
of the hall in the fourth dorm and the story about it was that a girl who was
going there for Senior year was trying to get into Harvard. When she got the
rejection letter, she OD'd on sleeping pills. This happened a year or two after
my mom had gone there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">When
I went there for summercamp, there was a girl who said she had gone in there to
turn off a light that was on. this was odd because no one was aloud to go in
there. the two girls were curious about the room and snooped around. when they opened
the closet, there was red writing all inside the walls of the closet. They
screamed and ran out, telling the counselor what they saw. the counselor was
clearly scared out of her mind to go into that room. Before she turned off the
light, she checked the closet. The walls were clean. Throughout the nights and
days at Catalina, the light would turn on without anyone there. The presence
was overwhelming and strong, sometimes just an eerie feeling. You can't prove
it, just feel it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">My
sister is the youngest in the family and she was pretty close to my dog Max.
She was so young that she didn't really understand what death was when Max
died. One night, a little after he had died, she woke up and looked at the
dresser. And there Max was, but only for a second. I wish it could have been me
that saw him. I prayed that I would see him, and I finally did, in my dream,
but only for a split second. I think my sister needed to understand that he was
gone. And Max made sure of that<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I
used to live at my grandma and grandpa's house till about a year ago. We had a
dog named Pepin, and we weren't aloud to have him in my mom's room. I was alone
in the house and I was doing my homework in there and Pepin was scratching at
the door to get in. Since I was lonely, I opened the door for him, but when I
did he just stared past me. I could see him shaking! Then he started turning
around, then took off through the kitchen. It was cold in that room, and it was
a warm night. I was so scared, I just stood there for a moment, looking in the
direction my dog had. Since then I've been convinced that there is some type of
supernatural out there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

I was visiting a grave and
on the way out, I decided to take some pictures of the old graves. Civil war
time graves.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After each picture they
seem to have come out well, as I got closer to the church I continued to take
pictures and my camera suddenly went off. It would not go back on. After I
pulled out of the cemetery, I was able to turn the camera back on, so I decided
to review the pictures that I had taken and I just got a message that said file
format not valid. I checked to see if the memory card was in the camera, and it
was, so I decided to try and take a picture while driving. I did and it worked
fine. I was able to review the picture also. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I
lived in </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Springfield</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style="font-size: 14pt;"> for five years and have been a frequent visitor to
the </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Wilson</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style="font-size: 14pt;">'s Creek battlefield. The place has a presence that
you can feel day or night because it was the sight of a good sized battle and
the park rangers will tell you the same thing of sightings while they patrolled
the park or hearing gun fire and cannons going off. One of the most active
spots on the battlefield is the farm house that doubled as the field hospital
were the wounded were brought for amputation in the house, but I believe it was
a confederate hospital if my memory serves me correctly. Last year in June
myself and a few friends were given permission to camp the night at the
location so that we could experience the events reported ourselves, one of my
friends got his degree in psychology and wanted to see if the reportings were
due to the history of the area, and we confirmed every thing the park ranger
had told us. At </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="0"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">midnight</span></st1:time><span style="font-size: 14pt;"> we began to hear what we
could have sworn to be low moani! ng from the house and what we could have
sworn were the shadows of several people passing the windows as well as
footsteps on the front porch. The footsteps would either sound like someone
pacing as if on guard duty or waiting, or it would sound like someone running
into the house such as an orederly or the surgeon, but the one thing that
remains in my mind was a smell that suddenly just arose around us of blood; it
was a heavy smell that lingered in the air that just made you almost want to
scream because it had an incredible sadness and pain. There was also a constant
presence being verified with cold spots that would allow us to see our breath
and this made is very uncomfortable because it was an 85 degree night!! The
presence would get stronger throughout the night and finally when we composed
our selves I looked at the house and said as loud as I could, "We know you
are with us. And we honor the sacrifice that you made. Please leave this p ce
in peace." My f! riends, of course gave me a look like I had lost it, but
they immediat ely noticed that there was a calm feeling now instead of
agitation and sadness. We stayed up the rest of the night to "chat"
with the presence assuring it that the dead her have been honored and
rightfully given their dues. Before we left we placed a small confederate flag
and an American flag that we brought and placed them on either side of the
front porch of the field house and gave a salute out of respect for the
soldiers. I have since moved to </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Florida</span></st1:place></st1:State><span style="font-size: 14pt;"> but still keep in contact
with my friends as well as the park ranger and we still talk about that night
as well as other occurrences they have seen on return visits. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I
hope this helps to prove the sceptics that there is a presence of lost life on
that site and they want us to know how so what happened to them will not be
repeated to others<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Hi
my name is Tess.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I dont really know if I
have a ghost in my house, but I <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">think
maybe I do.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Me and my little brother are
convinced something's not <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">right.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">You
see, our house is quite old and right next to a cemetary and a church.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Almost
everynight, my brother hears strange voices saying his name over and <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">over.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have never heard yoices, but I have heard
footsteps in the <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">mezzanine
(attic) almost every night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I tell myself
it's just the wind or <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">the
birds on the roof, but i get a feeling its some sort of spirit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">My
things keep going missing too.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I've lost
pairs of earrings, necklaces, <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">CD's,
trousers etc... once i even took some bracelets off, put them safe on <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">a
table and fife minutes later they were gone.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I found them about ten <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">minutes
later under the table.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The weird thing
was, they werent there when <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I
looked before..... hmmm...<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I
also barracaded my door once with my dresser so my dad couldn't get in (he <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">was
drunk again) and it worked, he couldn't get in, but like ten minutes <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">later
the dresser just slipped out from under the door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I dont think that's <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">got
much to do with things.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Maybe it just
slipped, but it's still all very <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">weird.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The
most amazing thing that happened once was I woke up in the middle of the <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">night
and I saw a white kindof transparent figure hovering at the foot of my <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now this was when I was very little and
living in a different house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I
still remember it to this day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I sat up
in bed and got a clear view of <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was just a mass of like gas or something,
but it kidof had a human <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">shape.
I was very little and my mum always told me that if i ever saw a <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">ghost
i had to say BOO.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I wasnt afraid of the
ghost.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I just said BOO and <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">it
kind of evaporated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I don't know, I
dismissed that as a dream, but it's <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I&#8217;ve
lived in my newly built house for one year now. It all started when I awoke
groggy from sleep. I heard a woman crying, and thought perhaps it was my child
or neighbor. Her husband would travel often. I realize now that it was a linked
experience. It was a couple of days ago, and I had stayed up late watching T.V.
started to get tired, and decided to go to sleep. So I walked up stairs and
went to my bed room laid down and was fast asleep. I remember dreaming and the
woman that I had heard For a year crying, came to me. She came over me and put
one hand on my throat, and the other on my mouth and face. She began to
strangle me. All I can remember after was willing myself to awaken. I was
flailing, kicking and trying to scream. That is when I finally awoke. My
husband was laying right next to me the whole time. He also was awake after the
episode. Scared and wondering &#8220;WHAT THE HELL!&#8221; he told me that I was really
screaming and tossing all over. You know when you watch someone sleep, and they
say they were screaming its always muffled (I wasn&#8217;t). Tonight me and my sister
we&#8217;re making dinner for all the kids (hobo dinners, to be exact) and we had
made all the kids come in one at a time to pick out their ingredients in their
own hobo dinner. If you don&#8217;t know hobo dinners have an assortment of
vegetables and meat or chicken and condensed soup wrapped in aluminum foil. We
made the first three, no hitches. Then came little A(we&#8217;ll call her that) she
picked her foods and we argued that she had to have more than chicken and
broccoli, she didn&#8217;t want to but agreed. So I folded hers up and put it into
the oven with the other three, realizing that when I put in the fifth one I
would have to move them all. We proceeded to make the last one and we never
left the kitchen. Upon finishing I opened the oven and found that Little A&#8217;s
dinner was gone. I put it in there myself, and it was not small, not something
you could misplace. We searched the entire kitchen and surrounding areas, no
dinner. We made her another one, but could not get over the lost hobo dinner.
We talked about it for a few hours while our husbands researched the kitchen.
Then we started talking of related stories and the woman came up, we joked that
she ate it(or our deceased gma did). Then I told my sister and her husband of
my dream experience. My husband chimed in and finished the dream but I didn&#8217;t
even know the end. He said that after he had gotten up the next morning, I came
out of our bedroom crying and saying that the ghost tried to suffocate me
again, then he said I proceeded to get a glass of water and went back to my
room( that happens to be on the top floor, and my kitchen on the main.). I
didn&#8217;t know that happened. Then he also started talking about old forgotten
coalmines and how a girl died in one, here in Littleton, Colorado. So we went
online and somehow in our mine searches came to this site. Do you think that
maybe the death&#8217;s of the miners and their families are still here reminding us
of all the injustices they faced in their lives? Or are they just wanting us to
take notice, and change things&#8230;.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Early
last year,me and my youngest daughter was cleaning a<span style="">&nbsp; </span>empty house to make extra<span style="">&nbsp; </span>money.Being sensative to spirit guides,I
pickled up a presence but choose to ignore it and cleaned the house.My daughter
kept hearing someone tell her to come upstairs and she wouldn't do it.As
evening approached,we headed upstairs to vacumn the bedrooms.What ever the
presence was kept unplugging the<span style="">&nbsp; </span>vacumn
from the wall and threw a marble<span style="">&nbsp; </span>at the
wall also.I also felt cold hand attempt to push me down the stairs as i was
going from one bedroom to the other.I dropped the vacumn and fled down the
stairs,telling what ever it was that we would be back the next day.As we were
locking the door,we felt someone one the other side trying to stop us from
locking up and leaving.The next day,I lite a white candle and stood at the foot
of the stairs.I simply stated we were here to do a job and mean no harm to
them.I also said that we would leave as soon as the house was clean.After that
,we felt them but they let us do our job.The house is rented now and i wont
step foot on the property anymore.I had a very tall black shadow step on the
houses porch and speak to me using telepathy.It told me<span style="">&nbsp; </span>to not come back to its teratory or else it
would push me down the stairs next time.Meaning i have small grankids,that's
fine by me never to go over there again.Im still not sure what i
encountered,but i didn't like it.The new tenets can deal with it and the bloody
vision of a murdered woman in the basement.As for me,I dont need the money that
bad to come in contact with whatever lives in my neighbors house.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Hello
my name is heather and i would like to share my story with you that is
completly true. My grandfather passed away when i was in the 5th grade. My
grandpa and i were always very close. My mother, my brother, and my grama all
lived together when my grandfather died. After he died my mom and my brother
and i moved out, as we were only there to help her take care of my grandpa. A
few years later after my grandpa had died and we had moved back home, i was
sleeping in bed on night. I woke up into one of those half asleep half awake
dazed and i saw my grandpa standing about 2 feet away from my face. I was very
scared even though it was my grandpa i know he would never do any harm to me.I
couldnt move, and i couldnt say anything because in my mind i wanted to yell
for my mom or my boyfriend.But i couldnt something wouldnt let me. He didn't
say anything just stood there looking very ashamed. after about 2 mins (which
seemed like forever) i women wearing orange with brown hair that was up in a
bun. She came to me and said "Dont worry your grandfather's with me
now" I didn't know who this women was because i had never seen her in my
life. My grandfather didn't say anything. She said "I want you to know hes
alright, tell your grandma" After this i think the women knew what i was
thinking wich was who are you? She then said "I'm your great grandma"
Then the disappeared. The next day i told my mother about this and before i
said the lady tole me she was my great grandmother, i described the women to my
mother. She said "Oh My gosh! That was your great grandmother Pearl!"
(My grandfathers mother). I know this couldnt have been a dream because my mom
showed me a picture of her, and it was the woman that came to me with my
grandfather. And before i saw the picture i had never seen her before. I ha one
other quick story to tell. When i was living at my grandma's before my grandpa
died i was laying in my bed room with the door opened. The end of my bed was
right in front of the door. As i was laying there something made me look at the
opening to my door. I look for<span style="">&nbsp; </span>quick
second and i saw what look like<span style="">&nbsp; </span>black
shadow move across the opening. The black shawdow kind of reminded me of the
Grim Reeper. About a week later, my grandfather died. Those are the only
encounter's i've had with ghosts, but i've always been very interested in them.
I plan on taking Dave's advice and going ghost hunting some time. Of course
i'll be as safe as i can. Please send me any feed back you would like. I would
love to hear from what you think. Thanks!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">We
were living in<span style="">&nbsp; </span>a house on Seymour Street
in Syracuse . It was my step fathers family home built around the turn of the
century . This was in the early 50's. At night (at random times)when we were
sitting around the downstairs we would hear a woman in a swishing log skirt
walking around in high heeled shoes in an upstairs bedroom. If anyone started
up the stairs to investigate the sounds would stop. We never could figure out
who it might be , since many of our step fathers relatives had died in the
house of natural causes as was the normal practice in the early twentieth century.
There was one Great Aunt who was found dead in the house under clouded
circumstances. The house was raised by the City in the early 1960's as unsafe
and unfit . <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">When
my family and I lived in Manchester MN (a very small town 200 or less people)
back in 1991 to 1994, we had rented this 5 bedroom home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When we first moved in, my 2 boys were 1
&amp; 21/2 and every night at 1:00am they would wake up crying. I would take
them downstairs and rock them back to sleep. After 2 months of this, we moved
into the bedroom downstairs and they slept all night. When my youngest was
about 2 yrs old, we were in the living room watching a movie and the lights
were turned down low and out of the blue my son sat up and was looking towards
the dining room and he started laughing. I asked him what he was doing and he
said that &#8220;the man&#8221; was funny; I couldn&#8217;t see anyone so I thought he was being
silly. Episodes like that happened frequently but no one else had seen the man until
about 1 &frac12; years later when a niece that was 8 yrs old was over to play with the
boys. They were upstairs, which we only used for storage and a playroom and out
of the blue she started screaming and ran down the stairs and said &#8220;there is an
old man upstairs&#8221;. My son said that&#8217;s my friend the man, he won&#8217;t hurt you.
Needless to say, the niece wanted to leave immediately. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I
had my sister in law come over to bless the house and while she was doing it,
she said she felt someone pushing her. When she was blessing, she had to bless
each doorway and she started upstairs, the downstairs and then on outside doors
and when she got to the last door all of the doors upstairs started slamming
simultaneously and then everything got quiet. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">We
lived there for about another year and I thought the blessing had worked until
we moved out and drove up to our new house and my son started screaming &#8220;I want
to go back to the man, he&#8217;s my friend&#8221;. It turns out that he continued to see
&#8220;the man&#8221; but didn&#8217;t say anything.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I
still get the chills to this day, every time I think about it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">We
stayed in the Farnsworth House twice. The first time my two neices were in the
Jenny Wade room and my sister and I were in the room accross the hall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We heard doors slamming at </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="1"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">1:00am</span></st1:time><span style="font-size: 14pt;"> but the people in the room
next to us did not hear anything.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">On
our second stay hubby and I were in the Jenny Wade room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I heard what I described as 'bullets pinging
off of rocks.'<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And shuffling noises in
the room at night.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Also
at the cellar storytelling I could smell flowers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">It's
a lovely, quaint place to stay!<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Soon
after moving into the subdivision, Terramar (67th &amp; Happy Valley in </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Peoria</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style="font-size: 14pt;">), I had several strange
things happen. Toys, some completely broken, would go off at night. Boomboxes
and lights would go on or off for no reason, sometimes right in front of you.
The TV receiver will turn up real loud sometimes with no one touching it. On
two occasions a very loud door would slam shut with no possible air suction
source (windows, AC), but then all the doors would still be open. Then when our
youngest girl was just able to walk and talk (about 15 mo.) she would talk
about her friend,"shadow." I would find her laughing and
babbling/talking in a dark room in the middle of the night (she used to sleep
right through the night). She would always say it was Shadow. One night I slept
in her room to see "Shadow," she kept going to the end of her bed all
night long laughing (I counted 6 times that I woke up) and talking at nothing
in the dark corner of her room. Yes, she said it was Shadow and I never did
that again. As she got to be 3 - 3 1/2, her encounters tapered off and I never
could get a satisfactory description. I might have seen "him" though
one windy 2002 November evening just past </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="23"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">11 PM</span></st1:time><span style="font-size: 14pt;">. I was driving down our
street with 3 sleeping girls after a Backstreet boys concert, when I spotted a
jogger with dark spandex pants and a red shirt jogging on the right sidewalk
toward me. I was two houses from him (about 150 feet) when he crossed the
street right in front of my house, I slowed down out of courtesy and he kept
jogging onto my property and disappeared. I stopped in front where I saw him
run and ran to see if someone possibly jumped the 6 foot fence and there was no
one and not one sound. I expected to hear the walking on the stones because I
didn't think at first it was a ghost, he was as solid as anybody. After that I
didn't care if I sounded nuts, the experience was nuts and I told many
neighbors. I learned that many residents have had some strange experiences
here.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Hey,
you guys have an awesome website, pretty freaky actually.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well I am here to tell you of one of my
experiences as well as close family that lived with me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well it all occurs at my old house in </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt;">West Covina</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style="font-size: 14pt;">. The address is 1401 </span><st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt;">S. Frandale</span></st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt;">, </span><st1:place><st1:City><span style="font-size: 14pt;">West Covina</span></st1:City><span style="font-size: 14pt;">, </span><st1:State><span style="font-size: 14pt;">CA</span></st1:State></st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt;">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well at my old house if you step inside you
get an eerie feeling as if there was someone there when there isn't
anyone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once I sat on my couch and
turned around to look out the window, suddenly this cold shivering feeling was
felt and I could of sworn that there was someone there breathing on my back. I
asked my whole family about this and they all said that they have felt this
feeling before.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Another incident at my
old house was on an afternoon afterschool.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Me, my nanny brother and sister were watching a soap operah on the
television, suddenly while my nanny was up between the door way the whole house
shook, it seemed to have been at least a 3.0 however the next day when I asked
all my friends about what had happened none of them said that they felt
anything.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An additional incident at my
old house was that my cousin who was living was us slept in his room, at around
</span><st1:time minute="0" hour="0"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">midnight</span></st1:time><span style="font-size: 14pt;"> he went into the kitchen for a </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="0"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">midnight</span></st1:time><span style="font-size: 14pt;"> snack, he saw a transparent
white light in the kitchen in an untangible form. The light moved towards him
and my cousin could make out the face like features on the transparent
figure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He ran away into his room and
quickly hid under his blanket.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He said
nothing of this but told us when we mentioned our other weird occurences at our
old house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also my uncle who slept in
the same room as my cousin received scissors.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Which is known as the jumping demon, late at night my uncle was sleeping
suddenly he felt hands grasping his neck and choking him to the point where he
couldn't make a sound, he also said that he felt a heavy substance on his chest
as if someone had sat on him he tried to hit the unseen figure hoping that
maybe he would be set free, after a while he was released, he never mentioned
this to any one in my family so that he wouldn't scare us also he thought that
he was hallucinating because how could something like that happen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Another story about my old house which makes
it old because we moved was when my grandmother came over and brought some
monks who were looking at the house for any mystical forces.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The monks had told my parents that there are
ghosts at my house, they said they were old like grandparents who once lived in
that house after my grandmother had told this to my mom, she quickly looked for
a new location and now we are living in Diamond Bar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If you were to ever go into my old house, you
can feel the cold shivers hear the creekings in the walls and for some reason
you can feel as if there was someone living up in your attic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hopefully I didn't scare you too much but these
are actual stories of what had happened at my old house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thanks for listening Bye<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I
saw the link<span style="">&nbsp; </span>for "Personal
Experiences" on your website and I wanted to<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">share
not only a personal experience, but a further clarification of one of<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">the
places mentioned on your list of haunted locations in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Colorado</span></st1:place></st1:State><span style="font-size: 14pt;">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Specifically,
I wanted to address the one about the ghost in the Boulder High<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">School
theatre.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I
graduated from </span><st1:place><st1:PlaceName><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Boulder</span></st1:PlaceName><span style="font-size: 14pt;"> </span><st1:PlaceType><span style="font-size: 14pt;">High School</span></st1:PlaceType></st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt;"> in 2001, and as a lucky
coincidence, I<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">did
theatre all four of my years there. I worked many late nights in that<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">theatre,
and I definately had moments during which the hair on the back of my<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">neck
stood up, or where I felt like I was being followed or watched. I was<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">excited
to see mention of the haunting at Boulder High's theatre, but I was a<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">little
disappointed that the whole story hadn't been revealed - of course,<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">there
wasn't room for all that, so I understand. I just thought I would write<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">and
share the detailed legend of how the theatre became haunted in the first<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">place.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Of
course, there are different versions of the story - urban legends tend to<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">change
a little bit with every telling. What I have below, however, is the<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">version
of the tale I most commonly heard during my time at Boulder High:<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Back
in the 1930&#8217;s, Boulder High was a smaller school, yet it still had an<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">active
student population with blossoming social lives. As one knows, dances<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">are
one of the most social events for high school students, and this dance was<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">no
different. It was Homecoming, and the dance itself was being held in the<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">gym.
Some of the attendees might slip outside for some fresh air that night,<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">or
even sneak into other parts of the school for some fun. This night,<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">however,
a small handful of students decided to sneak down into the boiler<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">room
beneath the main body of the school and enter the tunnels to have some of<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">their
own fun.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">There
were maybe six of them; three boys and their dates, wandering the<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">tunnels
in very dim light in their formal attire. They were laughing and<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">talking
and telling jokes, and for the most part you wouldn&#8217;t be able to tell<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">one
of these people apart from the others &#8211; except for one girl. She was<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">unique
because she wore a lilac perfume &#8211; not very strong, but not completely<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">invisible,
either. Wherever the group of students went, a small trail of lilac<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">scent
would follow, wafting silently through the tunnels.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">There
came a point when the students who had ventured into the tunnels got<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">bored,
so they decided to play hide and seek in the darkness. Laughing, five<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">of
the students scattered and went into different directions in the darkness,<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">hiding
from the one who had been selected to do the seeking. After a short<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">time,
he set out looking for the others, eventually finding four of the five<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">hiders
&#8211; all but the girl wearing the lilac perfume.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">As
they followed the scent of her perfume, one of the students stumbled and<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">fell
to the cement floor. Upon lighting a match, several gasps and screams<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">rang
out as the five discovered the girl wearing lilac perfume in a pool of<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">blood,
dead upon the ground. The official police report that was filed states<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">that
this young woman was murdered by a janitor who slept in the boiler room &#8211;<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">a
man who didn&#8217;t quite have all his eggs in one basket. The janitor, however,<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">escaped
into the tunnels and was never seen again, thereby preventing the<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">justice
system from taking retribution for the untimely death of the young<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">woman.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Perhaps
most eerily of all, however, is that the woman&#8217;s spirit still roams<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">the
tunnels beneath Boulder High, waiting to be found by her friends. It is<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">said
that, when seen, she is wearing a formal dress and walking slowly with<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">her
head down. If you are unfortunate enough to be working late at night under<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">stage
in the theatre, sometimes a faint hint of lilac will waft through the<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">air,
a chill will run down your spine, and you will no longer be alone in your<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">work&#8230;<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">As
for the tunnels beneath Boulder High, they are no rumor. The tunnels<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">actually
exist. I have personally been in a few of them, along with several<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">other
people who worked on theatre. There is an access point to the tunnels at<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">one
end of the area beneath the stage, and another access point in the boiler<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">room.
Other entrances to the tunnels, however, have long been lost. Legend<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">says
that somewhere there are tunnels that lead all the way up to the<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><st1:place><st1:PlaceType><span style="font-size: 14pt;">University</span></st1:PlaceType><span style="font-size: 14pt;"> of </span><st1:PlaceName><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Colorado</span></st1:PlaceName></st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt;">, but nobody has found the
entrances to those tunnels<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">yet.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">My
own personal story involves a late night working set construction for a<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">show
in the fall of my junior year of high school, sometime in October of<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">1999.
There were about half a dozen of us working late one night, and we were<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">closing
down shop to go home at around </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="22"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">10pm</span></st1:time><span style="font-size: 14pt;"> or so. I was understage
alone in a<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">storage
area directly beneath the stage known as Hell (the area directly above<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">the
stage in the catwalks is, appropriately, known as Heaven), putting away<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">some
materials.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">As
I flipped off the light and closed the door behind me, I suddenly felt a<o:p></o:p></span></p>

and began feeling very uncomfortable. As I walked somewhat quickly<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">toward
the stairwell that leads down from the left side of the stage, I caught<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">a
faint hint of something that didn't belong - something strangely flowery. I<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">took
a couple steps toward the tunnel and smelled again, and instantly<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">realized
the smell was lilac. At that, I ran up the stairs as fast as I could -<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">taking
them two or three at a time - until I finally was back up on-stage<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">within
sight of other people.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Our
house is over 100 years old. It is a one and a<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">half
story farm house with some beautiful old thick<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">timbers
that some idiot painted over at some point<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">before
we moved in about 6 years ago. Anyway in the<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">upstairs
master bedroom I saw a dark man dressed sort<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">of
like Abe Lincolon. I thought I was probably<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">dreaming
but it seemed really real at the time. Soon <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">after
my son who is now only 9 so was about 7 or so<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">asked
why George Washington was in the house. I showed<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">him
some pictures of the presidents and instead of<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><st1:State><st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Washington</span></st1:place></st1:State><span style="font-size: 14pt;"> he picked out LINCON. He is
just a little<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">kid
and I had never told him what I saw.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">My
husband has seen a short heavy set woman at the end<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">of
the bed in the same room. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">My
grandfather Jeroham died a few years ago and his<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">last
words were to me oldest son. He said he wanted to<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">watch
you boys grow up and now he won't get the<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">chance.
He knew somehow that he was going to die in<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">minutes.
I loved him very much and so did my boys. My<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">youngest
son was sleeping in my bed one night after a<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">night
terror and I was awake just watching him sleep.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">My
grandpa leaned over my boy and was watching him<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">sleep
too like he was protecting him. It was early<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">morning
and the sun was coming in through the window<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">and
it glinted off of my grandpa's glasses. I turned<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">to
look at the clock behind me and when I looked back<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">he
was gone. I wish I had never looked away. I have a<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">picture
of my grandpa in my bedroom which is now<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">downstairs
due to health problems and my inability to<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">climb
the stairs very well anymore. This picture is in<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">a
stand up frame on my dresser and it sits pretty well<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">back
from the edge. It falls off all the time. I think<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">it
is my grandpa's way of telling me he is still<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">watching
over my boys. My grandmother(his wife) has<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">felt
him sit down beside her on her bed too so we know<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">he
is still around.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Ok
one more story then I'm<span style="">&nbsp; </span>done.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">When
I was not quite two<span style="">&nbsp; </span>years old my mom
gave birth<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">to
my brother Shawn. He was three months premature and<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">died
the same day he was born, </span><st1:date year="1971" day="4" month="2"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Feb 4, 1971</span></st1:date><span style="font-size: 14pt;">. He has<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">been
a part of my life and my guardian spirit since I<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">was
little. When I gave birth to my second son I had<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">post
partum depression and my son had colic. There<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">were
several times when I just couldn't stand the baby<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">crying
anymore and was afraid I would hurt him. I<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">would
call out to my brother to take care of the baby<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">and
suddenly my son would just stop crying with no one<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">comfoting
him or anything. I know Shawn was taking<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">care
of my baby so I wouldn't hurt him and I wouldn't<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">go
crazy. When I was little I would put pinecones on<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">his
grave because it was all I had to give when the<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">adults
were putting flowers on the grave and being<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">sad.
I still go to his grave and put pine cones on it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I
love that grave yard and it has a very positive feel<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">to
it. There are these sement slab things over a<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">couple
of the graves and I love to go sit on them and<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">lean
against the headstones and read or write. I<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">always
feel very invited and comfortable there. When<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">my
parent's divorced they gave my brother Kyle and I<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">their
cemetary plots in the cemetary with Shawn and I<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">plan
to be burried there beside him under the pine<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">tree
when my time comes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I
lived in a house in </span><st1:place><st1:City><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Bartonville</span></st1:City><span style="font-size: 14pt;"> </span><st1:State><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Il</span></st1:State></st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt;">. with a roommate and we
started noticing different things happening.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">#1
Me and one of my best friends were in the basement playing pool when we heard
someone holler down to us. Due to the fact that many people often stopped by we
went upstairs to investigate to find no one there. We went back to playing pool
and only about 5-10 minute's later we heard it again. Thinking someone was
playing a joke on us we investigated it further checking rooms, closets,
outside, etc. to find absolutely nothing. We locked all the doors and went back
to playing pool and again heard someone holler at us. At this point we turned
off the music stopped playing pool and just sat there very puzzled about what
we know we heard and could not explain.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">#2
There was a light at the bottom of the stairs that would blow bulbs very often,
and would flicker just about all of the time when we were down in that area of
the basement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">#3
When we started talking to one of our next door neighbors we found out that
there was a fire in the house and the cause of the fire was from an old man
whom fell asleep in the basement while smoking in bed. He was burnt to a crisp
and had to be pried off the basement floor, some of the concrete came up with
him and the spot still remained on the floor. At that time thinking it was a
little freaky we thought nothing of it. Late one night we had a friend over (we
got back late from the bars) and he decided to spend the night on the couch in
the basement. The next morning we found him wide awake just staring at the
wall, we asked him what was wrong and he said he could not sleep because every
time he feel asleep he had a nightmare that a old man was burning in a fetal
position in the corner of the basement. Me and my roommate just looked at each
other in aw because we never told him the story about the old guy dying in the
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Weird Huh! <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">When
we moved into the house the neighbors said that people only live in the house
about 6 months at a time before they move out, but didn't really tell us why at
that time. It was 6 months to the day when me and my roommate went our separate
ways. Coincidence? I think not.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I
just thought I would share this story with you , I am very fascinated with the
supernatural and read anything I can find about it. I just found your web address
in a book I was reading in the library and I am glad I did.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">P.S.
I have been in the Peoria State mental hospital in Bartonville and it is a very
fascinating place, I wish someone would do a documentary on the site I think it
would be very interesting. While going thru the hospital me and my brother
happened upon a book from the scientific library that was part of the hospital.
It had different case studies on many patients problems and how they dealt with
them shock therapy , isolation , lobotomy's , etc. very fascinating stuff.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Thanks
for reading<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">My
name is Judy and I want to share my story of my visitors.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">We
had been living here for about 5 years when I first saw the little girl in the
long white dress. Our house was brand new when we moved in so there was no way
it was haunted as an old house might have been.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The
tiny girl appeared to me in my living room by a sliding glass door. I mentioned
it to my husband who didn't take me very seriously. We left a light on in the
upstairs hall so the staircase would be lighted. The house is open with a
balcony over the living and dining rooms and I would see a shadow pass back and
forth on the opposite wall of the living room at night. At times I would stand
in the dining room and a feeling of cold and the smell of damp earth would
circle me. I would step back a few steps and the coldness and smell would be
gone. It was always in the same spot. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Weeks
after I saw this beautiful child the first time, my son came to me and said he
saw 'something'. We had never told him about what I saw. I asked him to tell me
about it. He told me about a little girl who probably was about 3 or 4 years
old dressed in a long white dress. My husband started taking us seriously then.
Two of us had now described the sighting the exact same way.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I
have a very large doll collection and they are placed throughout the house. I
noticed that they were being moved to the middle of the floor like someone was
playing with them and a porcelain one was one day about to fall from an antique
baby carriage I had just purchased it from an antique store before I started
seeing the little girl. It all began to make sense then. I think she came with
the baby carriage and it was probably her carriage. I felt it was important to
talk to her so I told her that she could play with all the other dolls but she
should not touch the porcelain dolls because they could break. From that day
forward the vinyl dolls were the only ones that was ever out of place. Somehow
I always knew when she was in the room with me and I would talk to her. She
seemed to be obedient. She never did anything that seemed destructive to me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Weeks
after the doll incident I came home from the grocery store. There looking out
at me from the garage window was an impish little boy with ears that stuck out
really bad. He was smiling at me. I was shocked and wondered if I had an
intruder. Then I looked again and he was gone. I took a deep breath and went
into the garage and looked around. I could find no one. After I took the
groceries in, I started to talk very calmly about 'her brother' being with her
now and the same rules apply to him, too.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Then
one day, months later, in my living room, in front of the fireplace there stood
a tall lean man. He was a grey color and as quick as he appeared he
disappeared. I didn't mention it to anyone. I really didn't mind the children
but this man was making me uneasy. The following weekend my husband came in the
back door from his work shop and whispered to me that we had an intruder
because he saw a man going up the stairs. I told my husband the man had been
here all week but he still went upstairs to confront him. No one was there. I
explained that I had seen the man and he was dressed in grey. My husband saw
him in brown. I don't know why.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">A
few nights later I was awakened suddenly and there standing by my bed was the
man and the two children. The man was in the center with the little girl on one
side of him and the little boy on the other. He was holding their hands. They
stood there looking at me for a few minutes and they faded away. In my heart I
knew they came to tell me goodbye. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I
never saw them again. I went for about a year feeling a loss because the
children were not here anymore. No more cold dampness in the dining room or
dolls being left in the middle of the floor. I knew they were gone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">This
is my story. It happened and I know what I saw and experienced. I am grateful
for the experience. I know now they are real.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">While
the farm is gone, Sheehan HS occupies the land where the farm once stood.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The farm, a dairy farm, burned down in a
horrible fire years ago.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Many of the
building stood for a few years after the fire and once my uncle (1 year older
than I am) and I decided to investigate an old storage shed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It had two stories and you could only reach
the upper story by a ladder and trap door.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We were both about 10 years old and should have known something was up
with neither of the two dogs we had with us would enter the building, and both
seemed very nervous when we did.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Immediately upon entering the building we started to hear things from
the upstairs, sort of like footsteps.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
called out and no one answered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We went
outside, where you could look into the upper floor through a large door
(apparently like a hay loft) and we could see no one up there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again we entered the building and again the
dogs refused to enter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again we heard
footsteps.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We figured it was just kids
and decided to climb the ladder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
trap door was against the wall at the top of the ladder and clearly in plain
sight as you climbed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My uncle got me to
climb first and just before I got to the top of the ladder, looking up the
whole time, the trap door came slamming down.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I lept from the ladder and ran out of the building with my uncle right
behind me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was no way anyone could
have closed that door without me seeing their hand reaching over to it and no
one could see down to the level we were on without being seen but that trap
door slammed shut just before my head would have popped out of the hatch and
just before it would have hit me as it slammed shut.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">We
both stayed outside for some time afterward waiting to see if someone came
out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No one ever did and the dogs would
never go in that building even when we went back later the next day and nothing
happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Investigation of the top floor
found nothing but talking with a descendant of the family who owned the farm
said that it was commonly believed to be haunted, not just this building but
the whole place.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Now,
I don't believe in ghosts, but was never able to explain what happened that
day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sure, it could have been older kids
up there, but why would the dogs not enter the building, and how did that trap
door slam shut without me being able to see anyone close it?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Hi
Ive been reading your website for a while now and cant seem to get enough<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">of
it. Im not sure what this experience was but it certainly freaked me and<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">my
friends out. It happened about two years ago, i was at university in<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><st1:City><st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Chester</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style="font-size: 14pt;">, a city in the north of </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt;">England</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 14pt;">, i was in my second year
and living<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">in
an student house with 7 other people. The house we lived in was very old,<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">i
think it was from the victorian era, it had a cella and huge back garden.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Anyway
we always played cards in my room which was on the second floor, we<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">were
playing the game 21's which is when you have all the cards out on the<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">floor
facing up with the ace of hearts in the middle. We had just finished a<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">game
and everyone was sat on the floor, i think there were about five of us<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">playing,
one of my friends began to shuffle the cards and we began to play<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">the
same game again. When we got to the end we realised that the ace of<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">hearts
was missing and we couldnt understand this as we had just played and<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">all
the cards were there and no body had moved. We didnt really think<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">anything
of it thinking that it had just been dropped but when we began to<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">look
for it we got a surprise. It took us ages to find it and when we did it<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">was
on my desk under all my papers. How did it get there? We began to get<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">really
freaked out as no body had moved so i couldnt be any of us playing a<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">trick
on each other. I got so freaked out that i went to stay at my<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">boyfriends,
of the time. We all tried to forget this however a few weeks<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">later
more things went missing and we found them all in the back of one of<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">my
friends wardrobe and he swore he didnt put them there. Maybe it was a<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">ghost
plying tricks on us. Thanks for reading.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Well,
it happened about two years ago, at my old house in Texas. I was <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">asleep
in my room, (and I was dead asleep) when all of a sudden, I woke up <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">drenched
in sweat.I tried to sit up, but I felt like something heavy on my <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">chest,and
it kept pushing me down. Then, I felt something leap off my chest <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">and<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I felt this whooshing sensation surround me.
After that, strange things <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">started
to happen, like feeling I was watched.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">(I'm
sure it has to do with something paranormal)<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">when
i was young my father built a home on crowsmills road.Since the first day he
started to build, strange things started to happen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once the basement was finished he seen a
little girl standing where the back door was going to be, he went towards her
and she vanished.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the house was
built, lots of things happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our
electric organ played by itself (not plugged in), all the kitchen cupboards
would open and close by themself, furniture would move, and the scariest place
was my room and the basement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had
impressions of something sitting on my bed, chains rattling, my door would
never stay open and the room was always cold, eventhough it was heavy insalated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the basesment we had a ping-pong table and
i use to play for hours but, one day something scared me so bad that i never
went to the basement again. i still to this day have no idea what happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You can just imagine the arguments that i had
with my parents since the laundry room was down there. When we moved and the
new people moved in are realitor told us that the new owners belongings were
thrown around as if a tornado hit it. i had other experiences afterwards but
nothing since i moved to bc.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">There
is (or was, it might be gone now) a house in Mathis, TX .<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I lived in it for 2 or 3 months.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Several ghostly things happened to me
there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It might have been my age (I was
13) that triggered these things.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I hated
the attic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I would never go into
it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was one tinted window in the
attic that looked out over the front yard.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I always felt as if someone (thing?) was watching me from there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My grandmother lived with us there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was a hallway between my room and hers
and a print of the Lord's Last Supper hung there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I woke up one night to see two dark smallish
figures, midair, holding my door shut.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My other set of grandparents lived in Lubbock at the time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I again woke up one night, along with my dog,
and saw the figure of a man floating about a foot off the floor standing by my
bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It happened 5 minutes after my
grandpa died, according to the police officer who came by to tell us of the
death an hour later (we didn't have a phone yet).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One day, my dad was up in the attic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He wanted me to go up and help him with
something.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I begged him to come down and
actually nearly went into hysterics.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For
some reason I never knew, we moved a week later.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I don't know if they saw anything or what.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Just that one day they were talking about
buying the house and the next we were packing to move.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only history I had on this house was that
it was built during the Depression.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">A
few months before this, when we still lived in Lubbock, I had an experience.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One night I was woke up by a huge CRASH.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The mirror above my dressing table was in the
middle of the floor, unbroken, and nothing on top of the table was disturbed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">When
I was about 5 years old, we lived in Ft. Huachucha, Arizona.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My baby brother was having seizures due to
fever.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My mom was sleeping with him just
in case he needed her in the night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
woke up, saw a hooded, cloaked figure that appeared to be a woman, holding her
arms out as if to say, "Give him to me."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mom said, "No, not yet."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The figure turned, and my mom followed her
into the hall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She went into my room and
disappeared.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I
married a Navy man and we were living in Pensacola, FL.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our son had just turned 2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was in the kitchen doing dishes when I saw
my son come in and stare at me and then run off down the hallway.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I followed, thinking he wanted to play.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was sound asleep in his room.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">My
stepdad and I both saw, at different times, a black cat under our dining room
table.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We never had a cat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also at this residence, my sister would be
half awake and she'd hear weird chanting.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Then she would start to feel all tingly and the chants would get louder
and she'd astral project.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I believe this
because she was really scared when she told me about it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To this day, she experiences that.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I
am a firm believer in ghosts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I've seen
enough of them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now days, I try to
ignore the shadows I see.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I try to
ignore the chills and cold spots I feel.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I attract stuff like this and I don't want to, because to tell you the
truth it scares the hell out of me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If
there's anyway you know of to turn this off, please let me know.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That's why I've submitted my short
tales.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My grandma says I'm a natural
medium and that's why this happens to me.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My own parents said it was my imagination, but they couldn't explain the
mirror in the floor and how I knew people had died before they told me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It started while I was going through puberty,
and I thought that it was just that stage in life.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But it continues off and on and I'm 36 years
old now.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Please edit this section
out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Please feel free to use any of the
stories I've told to you if they will fit into your site.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They aren't like the rest of the stories I
read there, so I won't be offended.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
feels good to have told them finally.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Hi
i am Dawn and live in Kentucky when i was a teenager i lived in Leslie County
which is a very small place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We lived
close to this old one room schoolhouse that was haunted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Heres the story.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I'm afraid it won't be much of a story but,
when i was fourteen years old some of my friends and i decided to stay
overnight in this old one room schoolhouse that was "supposedly"
haunted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Time went by slowly at first
before anything happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then we saw a
bright light coming from the back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
checked to see if it was anything but nothing was there not even windows or a
door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We waited for a while and then
heard three distinct voices calling our names.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After a while of that we were huddled together scared and trying to
decide whether to get out of there or not to when my friend started
praying.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Somehow with the praying going
on the unknown voices got louder, and finally stopped.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Minutes after they stopped the door
closed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We tried to get out but it was
jammed, then smoke or something appeared and thats when we all ran to the door
and somehow it opened for us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We haven't
been back since that day.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thanks Dawn<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">My
name is Emily<span style="">&nbsp; </span>in the school of Mesquite

at our school.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The
Girls Bathroom:<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">One
day when I had to go to the bathroom I went in one of the girl's bathrooms, I
forgot which floor it was on but anyway so I went in.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">There
was no one in the girl's bathroom so I went into a stall and then all of a
sudden the stall next to mine flushed the toilet even no one was in there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I
told myself, maybe the toilets are broken or something.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">When
I was done going to the bathroom I went out of the stall to wash my hands, but
even before I got there I turned around and saw that the stall's door next to
mine was closed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">So
I hurried to go wash my hands and all of a sudden that stall's door creaked
open so tried to hurry to wash my hands cause I started to get scared.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">When
I was about done washing my hands the sink next to mine went on and then a few
seconds later it went off so I frozed in fear and looked into the mirror and
saw a girl standing right behind me so I quickly ran out of that bathroom and
never went back there again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">My
friend, Katelyn also told me that she saw the very same thing in that bathroom
the very next day so we both told eachother to never go back in again if we
only knew which bathroom it was in...<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I'll
send more new ghost stories in my school later, Thanks!!!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Well,
its not that I believe in ghosts, I more believe in demons and angels. So ill
be referring to every apparition as demon or angel depending on the
situation. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I
was young when it first started. I dont have a memory for dates. Just
experiences. My family moved a lot, my dad was a master of fraud in carpentry,
and we were always moving. I believe that he not only believed in demons, not
only saw demons, but was possessed and haunted by demons. I could rattle off
hundreds of events, but ill just pick a few. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">We
were living at this one house. You walk in the house and the bottom of the
stairs were right there. They went up and slightly to the left. Thats where
the hall way forked. My room was right there at the top of the stairs. I was
somewhere between 6 and 10 years old. The second we moved in I felt horrible.
Stressing out, not sleeping well, being scared of everything. Well, at night, a
little while after we moved in, I was walking up the stairs, looked up and saw
something in my room. It was a tall thin black demon (Even though I didnt know
at the time). And it was one of those things were you could feel more then you
could see that it was smiling at me. My dad was a very scary mean man. No way I
was 1:Going to wake him up because I think I see something. 2:Believe in this
thing because that would make me a wuss. So I sucked it and told myself it
wasnt there..every night. And every night he would turn and walk into the
closet as I got close to my room. And every night, when I didnt sleep in my
sisters room from complete fear, I would be near suffication. I would lie in my
bed and feel the whole room spinning, but not moving. The ceiling closing like
a coffin lid, but when I went to touch it, it was normal. My lungs felt
compressed, my whole body did. I had horrible nightmares every night in that
room. Well. It went on and on till we moved.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">My
dad slept on the couch every night. Would never go to his bed. When my parents
divorced, I would visit his houses. Big and empty. He got a dog that would
never EVER sleep anywhere besides the closest it could get to you. On the bed,
next to you on he couch, whatever. I was in my room upstairs, the dog awake at
arms reach, and I looked out into the hall, and there was a man. Big man pacing
extremely fast in the hallway. My dog was wimpering. It was dark and the whole
whatever it was, was very shaky like. Transparent like. My dad slept
downstairs, and according to my mom, never sleepwalks.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">One
time he ran into the pastors office at my church. Scampered under his desk
screaming Their going to get me! Theyre coming to get me!<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">When
I was younger, my dad got a new house (after the divorce) and honestly believed
that we were going to Be a family again so he started taking random things
from my moms house. Well I called him on it and found out for sure. So I told
my mom, she got the stuff back, and he called the next day. After he was done
talking to my mom, she gave the phone to me. His voice was different, deep,
raspier. He yelled at me, calling me names, just being a jerk. It wasnt what
he said that made me cry, but how scared I was of this person coming to kill
me. It wasnt my dad. I have heard him angry before, and this wasnt him.
Thats the last time I talked to him. And thats the last time I had a
nightmare. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I
have not had a nightmare since. I never slept good before then, hated sleep. I
just knew every night would be the same. Sleep, wake up scared out of my mind.
Well after not see g my dad for a while, I started losing this constant strain
on my heart. Until one day.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I
was a Janitor for about a 2 months until this happened. At this small Christian
owned company building, small two stories. The first floor was fine, it scared
me a little bit but I was fine. Up stairs was good though. Well lit, warm,
comfortable. But upstairs scared me down to my heart for some reason. It took
me a while, after the last event to realize why I knew that feeling. It was the
same feeling I had when I was young seeing that stupid demon in my room. But at
this time I hadnt but 2 and 2 together yet. The second to last day I worked
there I was upstairs in a closet getting something. Happy, a little scared, but
singing a song to myself to feel better. Writing this whole thing just makes me
cry a little bit because of how scared I was and still am. I was in the closet
and I heard sort of a woosh, but felt I more then heard it, shoot from my back
left to back right. Went down the hall. Then as I started getting up, a laugh
rang out In my head from a voice I had never heard before. This voice circled
me and just rang out in the building then stopped. I dropped everything and ran
out of the building, instant tears in my eyes. I never cry. Not even at the end
of Armageddon, which is a really sweet movie. Or even at Milo and Otis, poor
cat in a box down the river. But I was balling before I even got down the
stairs. I got outside and looked up at the second story and saw a small black
type thing. It was at the window. And it said one thing to me. Not from the
building, but rather like the voice was right in front of me, inches from my
face. I have never heard this phrase before this d I will ruin you. And that
was it. I got in my car and took off. This was all at about, 900 at night. So I
told myself it was just fear. The whole ride home crying telling myself it was
just fear. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I
went the next day, brought some people with me, and went during the day. It was
a Sunday so no one was there. I went upstairs by myself to see if it was just
fear. I felt the suffication tight on my chest, and heard something, I dont
know what. I yelled out , saying Leave! This is a house of God with good
people! You wont ruin anyone, now leave! I went downstairs. My friends heard nothing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">My
sister was walking home once from my dads house. We lived only a block away,
and she was 17 or 18 at the time. She had to walk by a park at night though,
and there were a whole bunch of semi gang like guys there. She said they were
gangs, but I think it was just a group of guys getting drunk. But anyway, she
started getting really scared. We heard about someone getting raped there a
long time ago, and she knew that at the time. She got close to the park and she
looked over and saw a huge white wolf type dog walking towards her. She just
kept walking trying to avoid the dog but it came up and walked right next to
her. It walked with her right up to our front door. She turned to give it a
treat (She had chips in her bag) but it was gone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I
was talking to my m about a year ago, asking her if there was any kind of
demonic presence that she ever felt, or seen around my dad. She said right off,
that he had a demon always with him. I never told her of any of my experiences.
Never. She said he had a demon, tall, skinny and always smiling.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
