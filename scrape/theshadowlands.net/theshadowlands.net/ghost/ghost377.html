<p class="MsoNormal">When I was alittle girl my grandmother passed in our home. I
remeber how she looked and what she wore. I remember as they put her on a cart
her arm falling out from underneth the cover they had over her. I remember
walking over to my grandma while no one was around and slipping her hand back
under the covers.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">That night while in bed my grandma came to say goodbye to
me. She was so beautiful and all in white and in aflowing gown. I remember her
smile and her goodbye, she turned and paused at the door then turned she was
gone.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My mom and dad took the death very hard. My mom opened all
the windows the night of her passing, never understood some of the things my
mom did until I got older. Anyway, our home was a two story with 3 bedrooms,
and always full of people. My mom came from a family of three brothers and
seven girls whom all had kids and moms sisters liked to hang out at our home so
it was always full.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My aunt was one who did not believe in ghost or spirits and
she liked to argue over my mom's beleif.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My grandma loved roses and my mom in memory of her would by or pick from
her garden 12 red roses and put them in a vase on the table.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My aunt was doing my mom's hair and telling my mom there was
no such things as ghost, I being bold as I was came out and told my aunt that
she should not kid about ghost,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>my mom
told me to get down go play and before I had time to go out the back door my
aunt started screaming and ran passed me out the door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The red roses lifted out of the vase and
layed a perfect circle around the vase . My mom went to calm my aunt down
before<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the nieghbors called the police.
My Mom told her that grandma spirit stayed with us and that she told my aunt
that it happens alot. We were so use to it as kids that it was part of us and
thought anyone who did not believe was weird. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">When ever I see a red rose it reminds me of that story and
my grandma's smile I was about 7 years old at that time<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thanks for letting me share </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Haunted Home</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">In September 1981 I rented a Victorian house in <st1:place><st1:City>Santa
  Rosa</st1:City>, <st1:State>California</st1:State></st1:place>. If you are
interested in checking on it, I could probably find you the address (the house
is still there, my son went by it about a six weeks ago). In the dining room,
in front of the fireplace, both my wife and I often seen a young boy of about 9
or 10 years old laying on his side with his head propped up by his arm, warming
himself. This always occurred when either of us was passing through the dining
room to or from the kitchen to or from a hallway directly across. The boy, very
visible, always turned his head toward my wife or me and smiled. We were there
about three months when work called me to another state--during that time I saw
the specter at least eight times, and my wife saw it a similar number of times.
It never made us feel uneasy, we just accepted it as part of the house.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Haunting in <st1:place><st1:City>Elizabethtown</st1:City> <st1:State>PA</st1:State></st1:place></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: craze4fashion@yahoo.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My name is Amy and I worked back in 1994-96 at a restaurant
called the Black Bear Inn in Elizabethtown, PA that I believe is haunted. It
was built in the late 1700's and is the 2nd oldest building in town. The
current name is Flaver's Food &amp; Spirits, <st1:Street><st1:address>45 N.
  Market Street</st1:address></st1:Street> in <st1:place><st1:City>Elizabethtown</st1:City>,
 <st1:State>PA</st1:State> <st1:PostalCode>17022</st1:PostalCode></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(717) 361-2115. I have written authors and
other websites in the hopes of having a story done or an investigation
performed, but no luck yet.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">At the time I worked there I attended <st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Elizabethtown</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType>College</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>(which has some haunted
buildings itself!).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I mainly worked till
close at night, which is when most of the activity happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am very sensitive, I hear things and see
things some other people do not.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But I
can honestly say, mostly all the people that worked there at the time, had some
experience.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The owner's wife was
extremely afraid to be in there alone after close.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At <st1:time minute="0" hour="21">9pm</st1:time>
or so every night there would be loud banging underneath the bar, I felt heavy
presences behind me, near me, heard footsteps upstairs when no one was up
there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We saw a whole heavy tray of
silverware flip over onto the floor as a dark shadow disappeared out of the
kitchen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was locked in the walk in
freezer when the door had been carefully propped open. I has a glass fly right
off the counter and smash into a million pcs onto the floor. The swinging doors
to the kitchen flew open and closed with such force all by themselves.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The basement-the one section has no lights, I
would run like hell out of there, it feels very heavy and scary down there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The other section has a well and a underground
passageway big enough for a horse that leads to the oldest building in town
across the street. People in town had commented they thought there was parties
at night upstairs, sometimes they would see lights and shadows moving about in
the window.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I clearly heard children
laughing, and went to investigate to find not one child in the whole
place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the ladies room, the light
goes off by themselves and I have even heard some people have seen a face of a
woman in the mirror.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I could go on, but
stories are too many!</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I happened to re-visit the restaurant last summer and ate
there, they have since renovated knocked down the one wall and added a deck
outside, I am sure that must have stirred up something too.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I still felt it as soon as I walked in there,
I got the same chills, but I didn't want to ask the server about the place for
fear she might think me crazy! It's might sound nuts, but it felt like whatever
was there, something knew I was there before and I was back, I got a strong
chill right outside the ladies room which would be hard to do since the kitchen
is right there and normally is warm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
felt like something was watching me as I left.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">It is such a great old building, I really hope that it makes
a website or book, I would love to hear or see what is found thru
investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I only hope whoever owns
it now would cooperate!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thanks so much
for listening, if you need any further info , I would be more than happy to
talk to you about it.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The Gentleman Ghost</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: Knechtjen131@aol.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;</span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">For two years, my children and I lived in a Victorian
merchant-style house in northeastern PA that was haunted by a very gentlemanly
teenage ghost. My son's girlfriend was the only one to actually see him, but
everyone had some kind of encounter with him at some point. The ghost was
definitely a tease. I think he did most of the things just to let us know he
was there.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">During the first year we lived there, my then-17yo son used
the basement as his hangout - and eventually turned part of it into his
bedroom. The other side of the basement had a walkout to the backyard, and the
kids (mine and those visiting) would park their bikes in that section, all
lined up against the back wall. Well, the ghost didn't like it when the boys
would curse in front of any of the girls. If someone let a cuss word slip, the
ghost would tip over all the bikes, one by one. Not like dominoes, but
deliberately pushing each bike over AWAY from the others still standing.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">One night, my son's girlfriend was spending the night while
my son was out of town. She woke up to see a boy not much older than herself
(maybe 18 or 19) standing at the foot of the bed, then realized she could see
through him. Her screams probably woke people four counties away. After she
calmed down though, she said the interesting thing was that as she first bolted
up out of the bed, he gave her a big grin and winked at her. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My son had a collection of old-fashioned liquor bottles he'd
inherited from his great-grandfather. These sat on a long shelf approximately 8
feet up - high enough that no one could just reach up and touch them. My son
kept the bottles lined up in a particular order, but now and then, the ghost
would turn all the labels to the wall and switch the order.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Another thing the ghost did, that we could all hear, was to
play with my windchimes after we were all in bed. I'd hung windchimes in three
rooms downstairs, which hung two or three feet down from 12-foot ceilings. As
soon as we'd all shut off our lights, we'd hear someone get each chime ringing,
one after another as if someone was walking quickly from one end of the house
to the other, swinging each chime. However, that would have been impossible.
Not only were the windchimes hung too high for someone to just reach up and
ring them, the three rooms with windchimes were connected only by a hallway.
You could not walk from one room into another...unless you walked through the
walls.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Soon after we moved into this house, I began having a
terrible nightmare about my son being accidentally stabbed in the stomach by a
close friend of his in the hallway outside my room. It was very vivid and
extremely intense - I'd wake up sobbing and have to go check on my son just to
be sure it was a dream. Even after we'd lived there a few months, the dreams
didn't go away. I'd have them every few nights.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">After we'd lived there six months or so, I joined an email
list for writers and got the shock of my life. One of the women had mentioned
being psychic several times, but I pretty much ignored it as an
attention-getter...until she sent me an off-list message that mentioned some of
the things my ghost was doing - like the bikes and windchimes. I'd never said a
word about the ghost to anyone outside of family and friends. When I asked if
she could tell me more, without mentioning anything, she replied that the young
man didn't mean to frighten me with the dreams. He was just trying to
communicate what had happened. She also said that he hoped my son's girlfriend
was too upset about his "little scare". </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I did some research on the house and came across an article
in the local newspaper's archives from 1963 that said a 19yo man had been shot
and killed accidentally in his home by a friend playing with a loaded gun. The
article said the boy had died in the upstairs hallway. My guess is, right
outside my room.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">GHOST LADY FROM THE 1700'S </p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: theres_only1_rachel@yahoo.com </p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The story I will tell you about is true and it happened back
in early December of 1982. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My husband and I bought a lovely old 2 story house about 1
year prior to the event. My husband and children and myself moved into this old
house that actually sat on land that once had a house that served as refuge for
escaped slaves through the underground railroad. This house was located deep
back in the woods, in the state of <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>.
I could tell right from the beginning that there was a creepy feeling about the
whole place; like a sadness. It's hard to explain. But anyway, on that
particular night, it was very cold and deep snow on the ground. I was feeling
very exhausted, as I was pregnant with my son, and he was due to be born in
about one week. I had a very busy day throughout that day, so I was glad for
nighttime to finally come, and all of the children were now fast asleep in
their bedrooms.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I was feeling uncomfortable, so my husband was asleep in the
next bedroom down the long hall, so I could have the big double bed to mys f to
try to rest easier and get some sleep. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My bedroom was on the first floor, right by the bathroom.
The children all slept upstairs on second floor. I had a bassinet waiting for
the baby when he was born in my bedroom, sitting right next to the wall, close
by the doorway at the foot of my bed. A lot of new baby blankets were folded
very neatly and were laid on top of the bassinet. Before I retired for the
night, I walked to the back of my bedroom and looked out into the crisp cold
night. A bright moon was shining and casting shadows from the many trees that
surrounded our house. The white snow glistened in the moonlight. I slipped into
my long flannel warm night gown, and crawled underneath my warm blankets, and
fell right fast asleep. After about 3 hours, I awoke suddenly. I opened my eyes
and looked down past the foot of my bed, and there I saw very plainly a young
lady just sitting in the center of the bassinet on top of the bunch of folded
baby blankets, with her dainty hands folded on her lap. The moonlight was
shining in my window, and I could see her very clearly by the light of the
moon. She was just sitting there looking at me. I looked at her, and I noticed
that she appeared to be very solid and life like. She was slim and frail, and
her skin color looked very pale white. Her age I believe was young, as she
looked no more then a young lady of 19 or 20. She had a very pretty face, that
wore no make up, or lipstick or such. Her eyes were light blue, and her hair
hung in long golden ringlets to just past her shoulders. She wore a long, light
blue dress to her ankles, with long sleeves and high button neck, with white
cuffs on the sleeves, and white collar. I could see the black toes of her shoes
just barely sticking out from underneath her dress as she sat quietly watching
me. She had on her head a white bonnet, with the neck ribbon untied and just
dangling loose on each side. I was thinking by her all dress or appearance she
must of been from the 1700's, and so THIS I thought. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">After we stared at each other for at least a couple minutes,
I just closed my eyes and drifted right back to sleep. I slept for a few more
hours, then I woke up again because I needed to go to the bathroom. When I
opened my eyes, I saw she was STILL sitting there looking at me in the same
position and spot. I got out of my bed and proceeded to walk towards the door,
and right past the girl. She did not vanish or move. She sat deathly still,
looking straight ahead towards my bed. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I walked the short distance down the hall to the bathroom. I
used the bathroom, and while walking back towards my bedroom, I was thinking
that this ghost apparition must be gone by now? But upon entering my bedroom, I
found to my surprise, the ghostly girl was STILL sitting there in the same
place and position as before. I walked back past her and I sat down on the side
of my bed. As I stared at her sweet, soft, pretty face, I decided to try to
communicate with her. So I asked her, "What are you doing here in my
bedroom?" To my surprise, she replied in a very soft calm sweet voice,
"Looking at you." I asked her, "Why?" She said,
"Because I'm lonesome." Then she asked, "Can I sleep with
you?" After she asked that last question, I got irritated or angry, then I
replied in a stern sharp voice, "Well, NO! Can't you see I'm pregnant, and
I'm miserable, and my husband had to sleep in the other bedroom. That's why I'm
sleeping alone in the first place!" Then there was a pause of silence, as
we stared at each other. Then I heard her reply in a sad quiet voice,
"OOOOhhhhhh." Then she immediately started to fade away (not vanish).
She first started fading from her face, then the rest of her just faded on away,
and she was gone forever. I never saw her again, but I had other encounters
since then. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">A friend of my parents (who shall be called <st1:PersonName>Bill</st1:PersonName>)
has lived in a house for many years, but just recently did we find out that
there is a spirit living there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We think
that he didn't want to believe it, so that's we never knew until now.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Luckily his wife revealed it, haha.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>First before I tell you that story I must tell
you another:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He has a young daughter
(let's call her Haley), and one day his wife (who was just his girlfriend at
the time, we'll call her <st1:City><st1:place>Jena</st1:place></st1:City>)
heard her talking in her bedroom. She asked "Who are you talking to, <st1:City><st1:place>Jena</st1:place></st1:City>?"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and she replied "Nobody".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After asking this question several more
times, Haley finally said "I'm talking to a little girl who looks just
like me."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You would think that this
was just Haley using her imagination, but not if you knew that she had a twin
who died as a baby.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Now onto the other story:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><st1:PersonName>Bill</st1:PersonName> and <st1:City><st1:place>Jena</st1:place></st1:City>
suspected that something was strange in their house, because objects would
disappear for days and then suddently show up on the living room floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also, one day <st1:City><st1:place>Jena</st1:place></st1:City>
had a strange feeling that somebody was with her, and got a vivid image of a
man in her head, and also got his name.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She told a friend, who knew the man who used to live there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:City><st1:place>Jena</st1:place></st1:City>'s
description and name of the man matched her friend's description
perfectly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She had seen the man who used
to live there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The man had hung himself
in the basement, but surprisingly he is a very kind spirit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He has never hurt anyone in the family and
sometimes talks to Haley.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One day, the
smoke alarm went off and they could not find out why, so they went searching
for the fire.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They went to the garage
and found that a gas tank was leaking, and believed that it was the spirit of
the man helping them out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I hope that Haley will keep her psychic abilities, because
as you know most children grow out of it when they are older.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Just goes to show you that spirits are our
friends and are here to help us sometimes.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">This is a very short story. One late night my father and I
were on our way back from the gold coast. After having a nice dinner. There are
a few bridges that you have to drive over. Anyway we are driving along and dad
said to me ''look at that''. at first i just thought it was weird to see a young
child walking along the side of the highway wearing nothing but black. In the
middle of night. As we drove past i turned around to have a look. The child was
no longer walking they had just disappered...</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Two days later I read in the newspaper that a women and her
three children drove off the side of the bridge in that same spot. The mother
and her 10 year old son had died instantly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">It was on a cold night in January, my sisters and I were
watching a scary movie and all of a sudden our dogs (pitbulls) started barking
like crazy including the neighbors dogs in the backyard. Well the dogs had been
barking for awhile and that was weird. So my sister and I went to go check in
the back yard and we stood there a couple of seconds, and looking in the
direction my dogs were barking. When all of a sudden, at the corner of our
backyard in the alley a cluster of lights appeared. They hovered forward, They
were the size of golf ball. They lasted about 10 seconds. The dogs stopped barking
the second the cluster of lights disappeared. When they disappeared my sister,
and I went inside the house immediately and said nothing the whole time we saw
the lights. Ok we went inside and told my little sister to come out to the
front of the house. We were near of our mailbox because we were confused and
scared at what we had seen. At first I thought someone was playing with white
Christmas lights. But there was no one in their backyards like usual. Then I
thought about aliens. Then I realized they were some sort of orbs. I wanted to
talk about what we had seen but my sister was too scared to talk about it. My
dad got home and I told him what had happened and he said that I should check
the back alley and see if the lights left any marks. The next day my dad
checked but he said he saw nothing. The next couple of days we didn&#8217;t go into
our backyard at night alone we&#8217;d go with someone.</p>

things happen to me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first thing to
catch my attention was the bathroom. When we first walked through the house
before taking it we notice that it was very cold compaired to the rest of the
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We thought that was weird due to
the fact that all the windows were closed and there is no A/C.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We took the house anyway not giving it
another thought.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Our first night was pretty restless.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was incredibly hot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We decided that a bath was just the thing we
needed to cool off. Well my husband was the first to take a bath and he could
not sit in the tub.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He claimed that the
water was hot when he filled the tub and when he tried to put his foot in the
tub the water was freezing! I thought maybe he was crazy and we ran the tub
again filling it with nothing but hot water.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And to my surprise, the water had turned ICE COLD!!!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We could not explain this so no one bath that
first night.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">This was just the beginning of a list of strange
happenings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A week later my daughter
kept running in the kitchen to ask if I was calling her name.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I told that I hadn't and she came back three of four times
saying that she heard me call her name.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I never called her once.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A month
passed and the next incident scared me to death!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was home alone with the dog watching T.V.
when my 7mo. old puppy started barking at something in my bedroom.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">She was terrified.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She ran and jumped in my lap and continued to look towards the bed room.
I got up and looked but saw nothing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
I sat back down she lost it again and became louder with her barking.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I swear it was as if what ever she saw was
coming into the room with us because she followed it till it was on the side of
me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She took off running towards the
door and wanted out of that house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As I
opened the front door it was as if I lost my breath.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I ran out of the house as well!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I sat on the porch with her until my husband
returned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When he entered the house the
T.V. was off and there was a smell of burning wax.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">All three of my family members would experience things being
moved out of place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We would blame one
another for the miss placement of thing like keys or the remote control.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After searching all over for the lost item it
would just appear in the middle of the floor hours later, sometime days
later.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We still smelled the scent of
burning wax.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I have to admit I'm really nervous about sending this story
because I really don't believe in ghost. I feel crazy for even thinking it!</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Well we moved out of the house three months after moving
in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It became to much of a problem.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Even the movers smelled the burning wax!)</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Am I crazy?</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Thanks!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">My story happened in the summer of 1998.I was sleeping over
at a friends house. We went to bed at <st1:time minute="0" hour="0">12am</st1:time>
and it was my friend and her twin sister in a sleeping bag and me in another
right by the AC vent. The balcony window of her house faced the playground and
at <st1:time minute="0" hour="2">2am</st1:time>, I had to go to the bathroom.
There were some rumblings outside her window and I was curious and decided to
peek. I saw these 18th century men with mustaches playing golf. They had a
light green tint to them and once they saw me, I looked away unaware of what I
had just seen. I was scared and tried to wake my friend up, but she didn't
budge and once I looked back, they were gone. When I went home earlier that
afternoon, my friend asked me about the ghosts and I told her as she had
confessed to me that she indeed saw them to. No one knows the story or why they
were there but I do believe in ghosts now.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">What did I see?</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">By: Anonymous</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;</span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I spent some time in hospital in <st1:City><st1:place>London</st1:place></st1:City>
last year,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>in a public ward.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I found that I slept very little<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and was grateful for all night television and
a pair of headphones.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Occasionally I
would snatch a few minutes sleep,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>but I
was always aware of Big Ben chiming the hours.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>One night just after I heard Big Ben strike 4 in the morning,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was aware of a very tall hooded figure
moving along the ward.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was unusual
because very little happened in the ward during the night,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>except the occasional visit from a nurse
taking yet another blood sample.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
figure stopped at the end of my bed,<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>turned towards me and I felt rather than heard &#8220;No,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have not come for you!&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I couldn&#8217;t see a face,<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>hands or anything - just this black robed
hooded figure about 7 feet tall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It then
continued silently along the ward,<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>leaving me<span style="">&nbsp; </span>wondering whether I
dreamed the incident.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Later that morning (before <st1:time minute="0" hour="6">6
 am</st1:time>),<span style="">&nbsp; </span>a hospital porter came
down the ward closing the curtains around each bed,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and I heard a hospital trolley being moved
through the ward.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After a few minutes a
nurse came and re-opened the curtains and I asked why were the curtains
closed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She told me that a patient had
died in the night and they closed<span style="">&nbsp; </span>they
curtains while they removed the body.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
asked what time the patient had died and was told just after <st1:time minute="0" hour="4">4 am</st1:time>.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Hello, my name is Sarah.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I do in fact believe in ghosts, and I am of Pagan religion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have lived in my house since the day I was
born.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, the house was added onto
when I was around 9 or 10.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I was
younger, I'd see shadows on occasions in my room during the night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Last year, when I was learning how to use a
pendulum, I did not know that was one way of detecting spirits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I would get so frustrated because it would
spin uncontrollably.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Also one time when I was trying to get this pendulum to
work, and (no windows or fans were open) a pop bottle flew off the table. That
was the only time I an object had moved in my house besides during this
summer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">This summer, things started getting weirder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My bedroom door slams shut for no reason at
all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My room is always colder than all
the other rooms in the house (well it always has been colder than all the rooms
in the house, even colder than the basement).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Recently things that run on battery die out for no reason without
warning, even if I put in new batteries.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Recently when I was outside with my mother working in the
gardens, one out of three bird feeders was spinning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was no bird, no wind, nothing that
could have made it move like that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Most
things that are happening are usually in, or near my room.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Well I had done some research and came up with nothing
except from a local newspaper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I mean,
there are two cemetaries both which are a mile from my house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is an odd looking rock down by my
garage, which has 2 or 3 sets of initials, yet was not made like a traditional
headstone, which makes me disbelieve that is was in fact over an unmarked
grave.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, a friend of mine told me
about something that my mother was always hush hush about.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Apparently my grandfather (my mother's father) died of a
suicide in this house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is the only
person who I can think of who would be haunting.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: blakkrose1974@yahoo.com </p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I have always been drawn to <st1:City><st1:place>Gettysburg</st1:place></st1:City>.
My 1st visit was in June of 1997. My husband, 2 best friends and I made plans
to visit the hallowed grounds. We all believe in ghost and were hoping to
experience something. Of course when Kat and I are together we seem to attract
ghosts. We did get pictures and video.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However that isn't what I am writing about...</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Anyway a couple years later when my 2 best friends and I
came to <st1:State><st1:place>Pa.</st1:place></st1:State> for another visit
naturally we had to visit <st1:City><st1:place>Gettysburg</st1:place></st1:City>
again. So we headed out to <st1:City><st1:place>Gettysburg</st1:place></st1:City>
with a couple of destinations in mind. Devil's Den, the Slaughter Pen and, (of
course) Triangle Field. Needless to say we didn't make but 2 of these stops...
It was nice out especially for late October. We hit Devil's Den first. Nothing
unusual happened. So we went to Triangle Field. My 2 friends( Kat &amp; Carol)
and I knew all the stories about electrical equipment failing. So we took a
video camera, a tape recorder, and a camera with us. Kat headed of toward the
left corner, Carol stayed up near the gate and I head foward down the little
path toward the rock formation at the bottom of the slope. We had the place all
to ourselves or so we thought. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I will say this now I have never had another experience like
the one I am about to discribe...and I never want this to happen again!</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">When I got to the bottom of the slope I panned around to
show the view. Kathy was off to my right and Carol was up in front of me. I
stood there for a couple of seconds and then I got this odd feeling. At first
it was just goose flesh but then it became more. I started getting feeling,
emotions and they were not MINE!!! I was scared, angry, homesick, and tired! I
didn't understand why I was here. I also knew that I wasn't going to make it.
But I<span style="">&nbsp; </span>had to be brave. The next instant
I felt a burning pain right at the top of my right leg. It felt like I'd been
shot! I remember crying and knowing it was over. Then after what felt like
hours but was only 3 minutes. I felt the emotions just fade away. I found that
I really was crying and was real shaky. I throw my hand up in the air and
walked right back up to where we had left the car. I had had enough.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">At the same time I am having my "moment". My
friend Kat is walking over near the tree line to my right with the tape
recorder. She heard something off to her left so she went to investigate the
sound. As she got closer she heard the sounds of guns cocking and a shot coming
from in front of her. Over active imagination...NOT! Well that was enough for
her too.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">We met at the van and discussed our experiences. Carol had
gotten a creepy feeling so she snapped a couple of pictures. Kat and I were
both amazed to hear each other experience. We listened to the recording and you
can clearly hear the sounds of people murmuring and the sounds of guns!! It was
also at that time that Kat and I noticed that without planning it, She had worn
a dark blue shirt and I had word a light grey shirt!</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">So, we left <st1:City><st1:place>Gettysburg</st1:place></st1:City>
that day. Later on that day we discovered that I had a hugh bruise on my upper
right leg! In the exact spot I had "gotten shot".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have yet to go back to <st1:City><st1:place>Gettysburg</st1:place></st1:City>
since that October but it seems that I brought a bit of it home with me. On
July 2nd of 2000 I discovered that I had a large bruise on my upper right leg.
And every year since that October trip the same bruise appears always on July
2nd. I am planning to visit the hallowed grounds of this historical town again
very soon. Maybe I can give back this gift I didn't purchase!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Haunted House in <st1:State><st1:place>Nebraska</st1:place></st1:State></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I used to live in <st1:place><st1:City>Bellevue</st1:City>, <st1:State>Nebraska</st1:State></st1:place>
about 2 years ago, and I lived in a house that me and my mom believed to be
haunted. We used to live on <st1:Street><st1:address>S. 19th street</st1:address></st1:Street>
in willow springs housing area. When we lived there we used to hear foot steps
upstairs from my parents room, but when we went up stairs to investigate it no
one was up there. I also saw a face of a young boy looking in at me in the
window in our backyard, and he didn't have a body. We also heard footsteps
coming up and down the stairs, and heard laughter of children, doors opening by
themselves. This one time I was sitting down with my hair up and I looked
behind me at the wall and saw a shadow of a figure standing with their hair
down, and blowing in the wind, but there was no air coming. So that was pretty
odd. At night, my mom and I would also hear scratching at our door, and we
didn't have any pets at the time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I'm
not sure if the new owners experienced these also, but it's strange because we
were the first to live in the house. thanks for reading this.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I know there is more ghosts at bard mansion then people
know.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I was told when I first worked
there that it was haunted.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But I
never paid attention to it.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But I
began to be a believer when I saw strange things happening.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There are some points in the mansion that
feel okay and some parts you don't go with out a buddy.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I seen and heard the whole family in that
house.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The kids would break my chili
crocks, the metal counter was bone dry and I would see these heavy crocks inch
there way to the edge and fall.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
would say, "okay kids that&#8217;s enough go and play upstairs" and they
would stop.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would feel like someone
watching me at all times when I would be working.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>You would as if this person was like a
really strict individual and wanted to make sure you were doing things
right.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would never go in the
basement because I felt unsafe down there.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I always made sure the door was closed when I was a working.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The upstairs was another place I always
turned the lights on at night when I went up there.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Just more weird feelings of a being
watched, people told me it was the nanny...<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>nobody went upstairs at night without turning on a light.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The chef would see carts push themselves across the floor by
them selves.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I used to close at night
and I would turn off all the lights in the building to only get outside and see
the lights turned back on the staff break rooms.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But the eeriest thing I seen personally is
the ghost of Mr. Bard himself.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
went into the bar area of the mansion and I got a soda from the tap, I wanted
to go outside but decided to go back to the kitchen and get some more work
done.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I adjusted my chefs hat in
the mirror and the face of Mr. Bard replaced my face in the mirror and he
pointed to the door and saw it slowly open on its own.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He smiled and I didn't feel threatened but
he disappeared just as fast as it appeared.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>All this is true, this is one job experience I value as places that gave
me more back then the job skills I learned from there.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Ghost I know are there:</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The nanny</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">2 kids</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Mars. bard</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I have one more interesting thing too regarding a listing
that you have for <st1:place><st1:City>Lebanon</st1:City>, <st1:State>Maine</st1:State></st1:place>.
I actually live about 1/4 mile from the old schoolhouse. I have never seen
anything there myself but a lot of people on my street mention ghosts of
children around their homes and all 3 people in my house hear the voice of what
sounds like a young girl. We also seem to have at least 2 other spirits in the
house. We've never seen anything but constantly hear voices and foot steps. I
have a lamp that I will turn off before leaving the house. By the time I get
out to my car I can see the lamp on in the window. The toilet paper constantly
gets tossed off the top of the toilet tank and ends up all the way across the
room. Lights turn off and off by themselves, things get moved around, and doors
open and close on their own.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Constant Hauntings</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: Tropicalnut2@aol.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Hi,I have what I believe is a constant haunting wherever I
have lived all the way back to my childhood. I remember being a child and
seeing a male,tall, dark hat and dark clothing<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"figure" in my room. As I grew older and got married this "figure"
was still appearing. Now in the last 5 years alot more unexplainable things
have been occuring, and I am not the only one now who sees these things. My
step mom died 5 years ago, I was very close to her. About a month after she
died late at night this perfume drifted into my room and footsteps could be
heard upstairs. My husband immediateley grabbed his gun thinking an intruder
was in the house he ran upstairs, however nothing but the perfume, very similar
to the one my step mom wore. He checked all closets downstairs and when he came
to the kids closet and was turning the old glass door knob it would not budge
as if it were locked. The perfume became stronger and it then dawned on me as
we were standing there trying to open this closet door, that there were no
locks on the closets, just really old glass door knobs(this was a house from th
20's). Finally it gave and opened which really scared both of us and we could
not figure it out. After that every time we came home this odor would be in the
air, it eventually became too much and we moved to my Dads. However one night
we were in his house in the kitchen area when his dogs started to howl
uncontrollably and then it was as if there were and earthquake the whole house
shook, of course this really scared us and we ran out of his house as fast as
we could and got into the rv we were staying in and turned on the news to find
out how big the "quake" was. Funny thing was there was no quake. I
flipped to every channel and nothing. So we moved from his house into the one
we are in now(1920 era) and activity has increased. I am actually getting
goosebumps writing this as I feel as something is watching me tell all my
secrets. I have been seeing more, things appearing and dissapearing, lights
coming on and off. I was barely getting sleep in the upstairs bedroom as figures
seem to love that room and walk by me at night close to my bed and dissapear
and reappear throughout the night. So I have moved to the basement thinking I
could escape all the activity I felt upstairs, however last night there was 2
figures that appeared. Now I know I am not crazy because I have already been as
far as seeing a psychologist, with absolutely no findings. I just feel the need
to get this out there to others as this is really getting to me. I hate the
constant feeling of someone around me all the time and I cannot see them but
feel a presence. I would really like to know what others think this could be
and is it happening to anyone else??</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">A few of my friends and i went out to old <st1:City><st1:place>saint
  louis</st1:place></st1:City> road and filmed for a t.v. productions project.
once we turned onto charter church road there was a car behind us. all we could
see was its bright lights and nothing more. When we found old <st1:City><st1:place>saint
  louis</st1:place></st1:City> road (by the way there is no road sign and the
road is a narrow gravel road that has no driveways to turn around in and is
surrounded by woods). As we turned down the car followed us! we could still
only see the lights, well the car started to go really fast and was directly
behind us...so we tried to pull over and let it pass us. the second we did the
car disappeared. just poof, it was gone. there was no way it passed us and it
didnt turn around plus there was nowhere to turn. so of course we have all of
this on video, but we took off right after it happened and didnt stick around
to find out if the rest of the legend was true.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I lived in this dorm building for 3 1/2 years and a friend
of mine lived in the attic stairwell room mentioned. You could not pay me to
spend a night alone in that room. As mentioned the room was always cold,
freezing in fact.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My friend mentioned her closet door would fly open and stuff
would move around. Another time she called me up to ask if she could stay in my
room because she felt someone pushing down on her chest to the point she had a
hard time breathing.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Corthel Hall (actually right next to Robie-Andrews) is
another one that is known to be haunted. People working security often mention
seeing people walk and disappear. There are a lot of cold spots in that
building. I went with a friend to see if I could catch anything on camera in a
stairwell she said was particularly active. My cameara, which was close to
brand new, started malfunctioning and has never worked since. I don't know any
of the history of the building other than that it's older than Robie-Andrews.
But it has been recognized as being haunted.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Back in 1982, was fishing in boat with my father and son at <st1:place>roosevelt</st1:place>
lake. I was in front with my son and dad was running outboard motor in back. He
was going to scare us and move boat back n forth, but motor handle jumped out
of his hands sending boat into a spin. I grabbed my son and held on with all my
might to keep from going overboard. I felt like someone grabbed me and held on
pulling myself and my small son back from the edge and the motor died out about
the same time. Once stopped the hold on me was gone.After sitting for awhile dad
apologizing for what he had done, we started back to camp. I looked back at
where we had been and I saw the figure of a man like he was floating on the
water. I waved at him and he was gone.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">My name is Beth and ever since I was little, I have seen
and/or felt ghosts in my house. When I was five I slept in the same room as my
sister, so that every time something strange happened I would blame it on her,
like if my teddy bear was in my bed with me when I went to sleep, but was on
the other side of the room in the morning. One night I went to sleep after her
so there was no way she could have done anything. I laid down thinking I
wouldn't get trouble out of her, but then I felt something tug at my teddy
bear. I<span style="">&nbsp; </span>ignored it at first, but it kept
tugging harder and harder. When I opened my eyes nothing was there but
darkness. Nothing happened for the rest of the night. Another instance was when
I was five and one-half. I was sleeping upstairs at this time with my other
sister, and our kitchen is upstairs so I could sneak in if I was hungry. One
night I was so hungry that I couldn't stand it, so I crept in to the kitchen
for a mid-night snack. I had only taken two steps in when I saw a shadow
walking near the counter. It was not tall enough to be my dad or mom and it was
not short enough to be my sisters. I though it was a burglar at first, but the
front door was locked and closed and none of the windows were shattered. When I
looked back it was gone. I have </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">seen many ghosts since but I will talk about them some other
time.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Hello, I am an 18-year old student at MSU. I have been to
the auditorium, and it is most definitely haunted.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">On the second-d floor, there is a hallway in which at the
end of it, if the lights are off and the time is right, you can see the
apparition of a little girl in a dress. She is difficult to see, but she is
definitely there. You can see two shadows at the foot of the door she stands in
front of, I have made sure during daylight that there is nothing to cause these
shadows, and there is nothing. Also, the spirit of an older man haunts the
building, and he&#8217;s a powerful force. His presence is undeniable. He is far too
strong to ignore at this point. He may be a cause for concern. He likes the
main lobby and the third floor above that lobby. I have experienced him in 5
places, and the places on a map, make a five-pointed star, a pentacle star.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">There is a song by Escape Club that has that line in it, and
I love the song. Have ever since about 1991, when it first came out. It really
means a lot to me now.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I have submitted another story to you before, but this one
is really special to me. I am in my forties and was very close to my parents. I
am single and have health issues, and actually lived with them for a couple of
years because I needed so much help. In March of 2001 they were killed in a car
accident coming home from vacation. I was devastated. In the days (and daze)
that followed, one of the things that really bothered me was that my pastor had
said in several sermons over the years that in heaven there is no familial
relationships. There are no husbands and wives, no mothers and fathers. That
bothered me, because I felt that I was no longer their daughter, and they
didn't care about me anymore. Even now I cry as I write this, because it hurt
me so much. Anyway, several months after their deaths, I had moved into a new
house and I was lying on the couch. I was all alone, and was sick. I have
fibromyalgia, among other things, and I was hurting and cold. I was in a fetal
position, facing the back of the couch, with my back to the living room. I had
a small throw over my upper body, and a smaller one over my lower body, and it
covered my bare feet. I was huddled on the couch, trying to lie perfectly still.
If you have ever had serious pain, you know sometimes if you can get in one
position and stay there without moving a muscle, you are okay. Move at all, and
the pain is back. Then the throw blanket on my lower body slid off my bare
feet. I started to get really cold, but I didn't want to move and try to throw
it back over me, cause then I would start hurting again. I kept thinking,
"I am so cold, but I don't want to move........" again and again.
Suddenly I felt the lower throw blanket lift up, be thrown over my bare feet,
and felt and heard the edge of the blanket slap the back of the couch before
settling back over my feet. It scared me. I was the only person in the house. I
squeezed my eyes shut and wouldn't open them and held my breath. Then I started
to cry. I realized my parents were still here, still looking out for me, still
caring for me. They may have died but they''ve gone nowhere...........</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">There is an old house near the funeral home parking lot that
is believed to be haunted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a renter
in the home, my family and I experienced several unexplained events.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>First was my 3 year old son who came
screaming from the toy room in the back part of the house on the 1st
floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He stated that an old man was in
there and he would refuse to go back in that room unless my wife or I were with
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Another was the basement that had
several different rooms in it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One was
an old child&#8217;s play room as it had drawings on the walls, another room was an
old coal room where they stored coal to burn.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was very creepy and no matter what the temperature was in the house,
that room was always cold and you would always feel a breeze move by you.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also down in this basement were our washer
&amp; dryer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It never failed, each and
every time that we would dry our clothes, we would go down to check on the
laundry and the dryer door would be open and the clothes would still be wet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It got to the point that we had to stay down
there with the dryer to make sure the clothes would get done.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Another was while sleeping upstairs, you
could hear someone walking downstairs.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Several times I went to see if someone was in the house and each time
there was nothing to be found.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My family
and I only remained for one year in that house and quickly moved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But a rocking chair that we had in the toy
room of the old house came with us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
had another son shortly after moving.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When he was two, he would not sleep in his room until we moved the
rocking chair out of the room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
claimed that an old man was sitting in it, even today, at 4 years old, he
claims to see an old man but now he stands at the door of our walk in
closet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">This is a currently unoccupied 3-storey townhouse in the
exclusive residential area of Taman Desa Seputeh. In the 1990s, this house was
occupied by the owners. They had a domestic help who complained to the
neighbors about nightly frightening sounds made by a mysterious bird, usually
between <st1:time minute="0" hour="0">midnight</st1:time> and <st1:time minute="0" hour="1">1 am</st1:time>. The owners have denied there was anything
wrong with the house but it is interesting that they covered the house with
over 100 Taoist charms, presumably to ward off bad luck or evil. The domestic
help who was Catholic, covered her bedroom walls and door with crosses. The
owners moved out in 1997 to an apartment. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">In 1999, my wife and I rented the house. We found the charms
to be unsightly and had them removed. The crosses had largely been removed
before we moved in save for a cross painted on the door which we left
untouched. In our 1st night in this house, I was mysteriously kicked in the
neck. I suffered excruciating pain in my neck and could not turn my head either
way and had to seek medical treatment. I saw a number of doctors who were
unable to diagnose my condition which lasted over 1 year and required special
treatment and physiotherapy at 2 medical centres. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">We noted the frightening bird noises. This was always
followed by the sound of a key being turned only that there was no door where
the sound was coming from! The original door had been walled up years
previously and there was built-in furniture blocking the doorway. Usually this
would be followed by our bed shaking lasting anywhere from 2 minutes to 20 minutes.
We had to pray aloud and shout for the shakings to stop and they did. When the
room light was switched off,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>we saw
mysterious floating lights all over our bed. I saw it as like a fine net coming
down on us. My wife saw it as random lights darting here and there. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Visitors staying overnight also reported seeing the floating
lights in the guest room. My brother-in-law from <st1:country-region><st1:place>New
  Zealand</st1:place></st1:country-region>, a tough athelete, was frightened by
moving shadows of children on the staircase in the early afternoon which were
not seen by other people. In our final year in the house, a blood coloured
substance oozed out of 4 spots on the walls of the top floor common bathroom. A
friend of ours, a Vice President of a corporation, who once used this bathroom
complained that she felt she was being watched the whole time she was in the
bathroom. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The house has 2 female ghosts who seemed to be sisters. They
seemed to have solid bodies but they only appeared at night. One of the ghosts
never says anything but the other seems to speak but there are no sounds but
you can her in your head. I never felt they were evil in any way though their
appearances always startled me. Once the ghost asked where my wife and I had
gone for our vacation before adding that she had never left the country! </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">To me, the 2 ghost sisters were harmless but they were
hostile to my wife and to my mother-in-law! My wife woke up one night to find
herself struggling with one of them. When I switched on the light, the ghost
disappeared. The sisters also woke up my mother-in-law who was visiting with us
and demanded to know who she was and why she was trespassing! </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">We have also noted poltergeist-type activity. Piles of books
have been known to float upwards in mid-air and move to a new position 10 feet
away and placed neatly on the floor. Cellphones could move by themselves as if
someone invisible was playing with them. We noted an inexplicable hot spot in
the master bedroom floor. There were no power sources or piping beneath the
floor which could have caused the heat emissions. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Once a year for about a week 3 frightening faces would come
out of the ceiling boards above our bed. We used to pray aloud and they would
withdraw back into the ceiling boards. I got contractors in to check the
ceiling and roof. They changed the ceiling boards and some of the rooftiles.
They also let sunshine into the ceiling loft. The next year the 3 faces
returned. We just gave up!</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">We left the house in 2002 to move into our new home. On the
last night as I was giving the front bedroom floor a last wipe before returning
the keys to the owners, the floor started to shake with the same intensity as
our bed. I told my wife and mother-in-law who were nearby not to come into the
room. My wife took a last peek at the top floor before leaving the house for good
and sighted a pink-coloured semi-transparent spectre coming out of the front
bedroom with the shaking floor. The ghost walked across the landing and walked
into the wall where there was once a door! The sound of a key turning was
heard. The pink ghost's line of movement would cut right through the bed,
possibly causing it to shake.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">We rented the house for nearly 3 years as the rent was very
cheap for a fully furnished 6-bedroom house. Besides, we were God-fearing
Christians and we were never unduly afraid although the hauntings were a
nuisance. We constantly informed the owners of the hauntings but they did not
react. I personally feel there were at least 6 ghosts in the house.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">After we left, the house was unoccupied for some months and
rapidly became a home to all sorts of wild animals, including snakes! The house
became rundown very quickly and was an eyesore in the neighborhood. The owners
were forced to repair and renovate the house when the neighbors threatened
legal action! Contractor after contractor could not finish the work which
lasted over a period of 2 years. Some of the contractors' workers were seen
running out of the house at night leaving all their belongings and tools
behind. They had unknowingly occupied the haunted rooms. The house was finally
totally renovated by workers working only in the daytime. No tenant could be
found to the present day although the house has been beautifully renovated.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">When i was 13 i saw my granddad standing next to the fire
while i was sleeping on the sofa poorly. He was dressed in all white with a
cloth cap. I was not scared for some reason and went back to sleep. On waking
in the morning i told my mam what i had saw, she said that it was my granddad
who i had never met before and that he was coming to protect or warn me and two
weeks later i had a fit and nearly died i think he came to warn me.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I cant remember much of what my granddad did but i remember
my mam telling me he used to play cricket and that's why he was dressed in white.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">After that lose of my mother three years had passed so i
decided to go and have a reading, straitaway she told me my mam was there and
she had Frank with her and he is wearing his loverly white jumper which that

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I know this story is true because it happened to me.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">In the late 1980s and early 90s I was a staff member at the
Merchant's House Museum, a beautiful national landmark 1832 Greek Revival
rowhouse in Greenwich Village, New York City. It's the only INTACT familiy home
from the 19th Century surviving in <st1:City><st1:place>Manhattan</st1:place></st1:City>
and stepping through the front door is like stepping into a time machine. The
Tredwell Family lived there for 100 years and when Gertrude died in 1933, it's
as if time stood still. Many people believe that Gertrude is still in the
house, protecting it as she did for the 93 years she lived there. It's been a
museum since 1936 and many people have experienced strange happenings there.
Here's my "favorite" </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">person experience:</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">In September of 1988, I was acting as Sunday Manager and my
tasks were to open up, supervise visitors and tour guides on this busiest day
of the museum week, and then, after everyone was gone, to close up for the day.
My routine was to close the windows, shut and bolt the shutters, extinguish the
lights and close the doors, one room after another. As was my habit, I started
with the rooms on the kitchen (ground-level) floor, and worked my way up through
the parlor floor and to the best bedroom floor. Since the rear bedroom was
closest to the stairs leading to the third (office) floor, I would save that
room for last and then just head up the stairs, gather my things, set the alarm
and leave. It was always kind of creepy being in the house all alone and I
would often break the mood by talking out loud, or whistling. On this
particular day, just before entering this last bedroom, I said aloud, &#8220;Well,
this is the last room and then I can leave.&#8221;</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">It didn't strike me as odd at the time that the door to the
room, which had been open just a few minutes before was now closed. I wasn't
really paying attention. But when I stepped into the room, I froze in my
tracks. Although the room should have been wide open, with the shutters parted
and the lights on, instead, it was completely dark, the windows shut and the
shutters already bolted. I know I hadn't shut the room up yet, I know it had
been open only minutes before, and I was totally certain I was completely alone
in the house. I managed to croak out a hoarse, "Thanks, Gertrude."
and I left the museum very quickly that evening.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">To this day (October 2005) I sometimes ask myself "Did
this really happen?" </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">and I know it did.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I don't work in the museum any longer, but I've remained an
active volunteer and I know of many other stories associated with the house. In
fact, every October, the museum devotes Friday evenings to special "ghost
tours" where docents take visitors through the house where many of the
tales are shared in the very spot where they happened. These are very popular
tours.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I used to live in this house until 7 years ago. This house
is in the exclusive Taman Desa Seputeh residential area of <st1:City><st1:place>Kuala
  Lumpur</st1:place></st1:City>. This 25-year old house has 6 bedrooms and a
very large garden.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The house has only one known ghost who haunts the rear
bedroom on the top floor. No one knows the history as the house has changed
owners several times in 25 years. This ghost would normally strangle the
occupant in the early hours of the morning.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In my case, I felt something like a human being lying on top of me and
it was strangling me and I could not cry out for help at all. It took me great
effort to throw off whatever it was. This was when an apparition of a very old
looking man appeared 3 feet from my bed. He stared at me with angry glowing
eyes and slowly, bit by bit, he disappeared before my eyes. This haunting never
recurred in the next 7 years I lived there. Gradually I became aware that the
hauntings were known in the neighborhood.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">There were 2 other reported sightings with similar
strangling attempts in the room before me. Most of the previous tenants lasted
less than 6 months in that room. Incidentally, it was generally felt by most of
the house's occupants that living there had an adverse effect on one's personal
relationships, finances or career. Everyone I had spoken to who lived there
experienced a tremendous improvement in their lives the moment they moved out.
Even the landlord who owned the house for 15 years suffered great financial
loss and had one business after another collapsing. He finally sold the house
as he desperately needed the money to get back on his feet.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">This house has been bought by a family who do not know of
its history. They have completely re-modeled the house and it does not resemble
its original design at all. The neighbors are waiting to find out if the ghost
is still up there in the rear bedroom.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">HAUNTED HOUSE IN PETALING <st1:place><st1:City>JAYA</st1:City>,
 <st1:country-region>MALAYSIA</st1:country-region></st1:place></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">This is a family-owned &amp; occupied house in Section 17
residential area in Petaling Jaya. The present owners bought the house from
another family some 20 odd years ago. They were not told anything of its past
history. The house is over 40 years old and was built on the site of another
building, history unknown.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The house is haunted by a "bathroom ghost" - this
semi-transparent bluish-white ghost is usually seen after <st1:time minute="0" hour="0">midnight</st1:time> and before dawn (multiple sightings) sitting on
the WC. Facial features cannot be made out &amp; the sex of the ghost in
unknown. Family members were initially terrified by it but they are now used to
it and often sit where the ghost is sitting if they could not help it anymore!
They reported that there would be a strange feeling as if something was going
through them but the ghost would just disappear and allow the family member to
use the bathroom in peace. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">There was a reported sighting of a moaning old man without
eyeballs in the eye sockets who materialised through the locked door of the
guest bedroom at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="4">4am</st1:time> (only 1
known sighting to-date). This ghost was very terrifying and the person who saw
it ran out of the house! It is believed that this could be the "toilet
ghost" terrorising a visitor who was not from the family! Family members
have not seen this ghost but they have sensed an occassional presence in the
guest room.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Weird and malicious laughter used to be heard in the
children's bedroom when they were growing up. The children were frightened but
they never saw anything and nothing ever happened to them. Two sisters who were
relatives of the family once slept in the room overnight. Both sisters are very
credible and level-headed people - one is a corporate lawyer and the other is a
college professor. They felt that they were being watched the whole night and
the family dog kept whining outside their door. As they were very uneasy and
could not sleep, the sisters got up and moved to the guest bedroom which was
empty. The family dog tried to come in with them but they pushed her out. The
dog began to whine piteously and scratch the room door for a long time. And
then there was silence. The sisters were now very disturbed and had a feeling
something terrible had happened. They opened the door to discover that the walls
outside the guest bedroom were smeared with excrement from the ceiling to the
floor! Later they realised the excrement was from the family dog who had been
so terrified that she lost bowel control but no one could explain how the
excrement got smeared all over the walls. Understandably the sisters left first
thing in the morning never to spend another night there!</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The children's bedroom looks normal when you are in the
room. It is furnished in a light 1960s style. A number of people have seen the
bedroom through the window and they have all seen that the interior was very
different. The room seemed to be furnished with dark, heavy 19th century style
furniture instead. One day when I was visiting, the children &amp; their
friends told me they had just been scared out of their wits by the evil
laughter in the children's bedroom. I went into the room. I heard nothing but
noted a strange looking mirror fixed to the wardrobe. I went to inspect the
mirror closely and was astonished that the mirror's reflection showed a large
inner courtyard in a 19th century home, not me nor the actual interior of the
room. When I turned around and asked the others to take a look, the vision
vanished and it was just a normal reflection looking back at me.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The family dog ( who has since died) used to be very
terrified on certain nights and would scratch at the various bedroom doors
until someone let her in for the night. The ghostly presence in the house
exists until today.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Great Grandparents</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">My mother always told me about the night I was born growing
up. Her grandparents (my great-grandparents) were very old, and had announced
that they weren't going to die without seeing their first great-grandchild. The
night my mother was giving birth, they couldn't make it to come see because
they weren't feeling well, but they said they'd come the next day. I was born
early the next morning, at <st1:time minute="58" hour="7">7:58 am</st1:time>,
and after I was cleaned up and everything, the doctor said he would go inform
the rest of the family they could come in. Not moments after he walked out the
door, my great-grandparents came in, all dressed in their sunday best, and my
mother let my great-grandmother hold me. My mom says they smiled down at me,
and told me that they'd make sure I was taken care of, and gave me a kiss, then
handed me back to my mother and said they had to leave. A few minutes later,
the rest of my family came in with terrible news. My great-grandparents had
just died at home.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Up until I was about 7, that appeared to be the extent of
it, other than my great-grandparents had left a trust fund in my name to ensure
I got to go to college and such. However, when I was seven, my mother married
my stepfather, who was a very abusive person. A few months after the wedding, I
woke up in my bedroom and heard my stepfather beating my mother upstairs, and
heard her crying. I was about to get out of bed and go help when I heard an old
woman's voice call to me. I turned around and an old woman who glowed kind of
blue-ish was standing by my closet door. She told me to stay in my room, that I
couldn't help my mother, and I'd only get hurt if I went upstairs. The woman
felt so loving, I decided to do what she said and hid in my bed. She sat by my
bedside until I fell asleep. For the next few years, every night that my
stepfather would get abusive with my mother, the old woman would appear and
tell me to sleep, and sit by my bed until I slept. I didn't know who she was,
but I felt safe with her, and she seemed very familiar. After a few years had
passed, when I was about 11, my grandmother was going through a box of old
pictures, and I was helping her. In the box was a picture of my
great-grandparents, and I gasped when I realized that that was the woman I had
seen. I asked my grandmother if I could have it, and she told me that was fine.
I framed the picture and put it on my dresser, because I knew that they were
still taking care of me. Throughout my life, I had been very unpopular at
school, but it became much worse when I was 12. One morning when I arrived at
school, two of the worst asked me who the old man on my porch was. I told them
I didn't know what they were talking about. I later learned from others that
they had come over to tp my house, and that an old man had been sitting on the
porch and told them not to try it. I have reasoned that it was my
great-grandfather. Not much later, I moved in with my father, and things became
much wierder. My father had bought a house in a new subdivision, the land for
which had been slave quarters, and then abandoned because no one wanted it. The
first night I slept there, I kept hearing a little boy crying, but when I would
look around, no one was there. The second night I woke up to see a man standing
over my bed, and I started shaking and the room became very cold. I prayed that
God would keep me safe, and when I opened my eyes he was gone. I fell asleep
for a little while, then woke up because the room was cold again. I opened my
eyes, and my great grandfather was sitting by my bed, glowing blue-ish, just
like my great grandmother would, and he appeared very angry. I thanked him for
keeping me safe, and he smiled, but stayed sitting there, glaring into the
corner of the room near my window. After that night I usually slept fine, but
every once in a while I'd wake up and my great-grandfather would be sitting
there angrily. When I was 16, I decided to plant some flowers outside my
bedroom window, and while I was digging up the clay and replacing it with
topsoil, I kept coming across these tiny white things. Every time I'd find one
I'd get this horrible feeling in the pit of my stomach. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Finally I put the ones I'd found into a ziploc bag, with the
intent to ask my stepmother what they were. I forgot, and put them on my
dresser. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I woke up in the middle of the night that night, and my
grandfather was sitting by my bed, and there was a little boy standing by my
dresser, reaching up towards the top. I got up and went over to my dresser, and
picked up the bag. When I turned around the boy was gone. The next morning I
asked my dad what they were, and he told me they looked like children's teeth.
That afternoon I put them in a old jewelry box of mine, and buried them in my
little garden and prayed for the child they had belonged to. I never saw ghosts
at my dad's house again. Other than that, my great grandparent's have appeared
at random times, but always to help me or protect me from something. Once when
I was in college, I got very drunk and one of the guys at the party was going
to try and take advantage of me. The next morning I found out he had been seen
running from our sorority house, being chased by an old man who was screaming
obscenities at him. The final thing that happened, it really freaked out most
of my family. My boyfriend of a few years had decided to propose to me, and was
saving up money to buy me a nice ring. He was walking home from the library (a
block from our house) when he was stopped by an old man and an old woman. They
asked him why he appeared so troubled. Being polite, he decided to talk with
them, and he told them that he wanted to propose, but couldn't afford the kinds
of rings he thought I would like. At that, the old woman pulled her wedding
rings and her engagement ring off, and handed them to him. He told her he
couldn't accept them, but the couple was gone, leaving the rings behind. After
some internal struggling, he decided to propose with the engagement ring. When
I brought him to visit my family just after he proposed, he was shocked when he
saw a picture of the two of them in my grandmother's house. My grandmother was
shocked when she saw the ring, because they had buried my great-grandmother
with all of her rings on. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">It's been about a year, and no one else has seen them since.
I don't know if I'll ever see them again, but they have watched over me and
protected me since I was a baby.</p>
