</H3><P><B>By: dao@students.uiuc.edu</B>
<P>
<P><B>First I would like to say how grateful I am for this site. I am new
to</B>
<P><B>the internet and did not know this sort of fellowship was possible
a</B>
<P><B>couple of weeks ago.</B>
<P>
<P><B>When I was about 9 years old my aunt passed away. She was a very kind
and</B>
<P><B>loving woman who had a special place in her heart for me. Her kids
had</B>
<P><B>grown up and moved away years ago and I guess she looked at me as a</B>
<P><B>surragate son.  I spent a lot of time at her house and was glad to
be</B>
<P><B>there. My parents didn't get along very well and being with her
provided</B>
<P><B>a way to get away from them. like I said she was a great lady and I</B>
<P><B>enjoyed spending time with her, she also spoiled me rotten. Her
husband</B>
<P><B>was a retired police officer who had passed away several years before.
</B>
<P>
<P><B>Anyway, Aunt Bernice died in the summer of my ninth year. Nothing</B>
<P><B>unusual had happened in between the time of her death and the night
I</B>
<P><B>saw her again. No flickering lights or misplaced objects or any thing</B>
<P><B>else. I simply awoke one night and saw her standing over my bed,not</B>
<P><B>floating, feet on the floor. I was glad to see her at first but a 9
year</B>
<P><B>old is fully aware what death is and I knew she did not belong there.</B>
<P><B>I did not feel threatened but I did not know how to handle this so
I</B>
<P><B>called for my parents. They came in and saw her as well. My dad was
of</B>
<P><B>no use. However my mom got up the nerve to speak to her. She asked
my</B>
<P><B>aunt what she was doing here. She replyed that she had basicly come
for</B>
<P><B>me. Now I began to get scared and I got upset. My mom told Aunt
Bernice</B>
<P><B>that she didnt belong here and that I could not go with her. She
looked</B>
<P><B>at my mom then back at me, I was in tears by now, she made a sad face
and</B>
<P><B>faded away. Now I know that little boys have vivid dreams and nightmares
</B>
<P><B>and now that I am 30 I could easily write off the whole thing as that</B>
<P><B>but I kmow what I saw and further more my parents were there to back
me</B>
<P><B>up. I know that this stuff is real. </B>
<P>
<P><B>I hope that this story is somehow helpful to someone. Being able to</B>
<P><B>share it without having to worry about the people I am telling it to
thinking I am</B>
<P><B>some kind of nut has helped me.   </B>

</H3><P>
<P><B>By:  MzRob@worldnet.att.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>     I want to share a very strange yet wonderful </B>
<P><B>experience I had in a house I once lived in.It all started when my
brother, sister</B>
<P><B> and her 2 yr old little girl came to live with me in California. I
believe now</B>
<P><B> that the presence of a child in a house that was previously childless
brought out the </B>
<P><B>entity. Shortly after they all moved in, I was babysitting my while
my sister worked. </B>
<P><B>It was close to 2am when I suddenly woke up to find a little blonde
girl about 2 years</B>
<P><B> old standing in thedoorway of my open bedroom door. She was crying
softly.</B>
<P><B> I raised up and thinking it was my sister's daughter, I told her to
go back</B>
<P><B> to bed. I laid back down, but decided to check on her to make sure
she was okay.</B>
<P><B> I went where she was sleeping and that's exactly how I found her,
sleeping soundly.</B>
<P><B> I was puzzled but thought that she might have been sleepwalking. </B>
<P><B>   The next day, I was brushing my hair. I put the brush in the </B>
<P><B>bathroom sink and turned around to get something. When I turned back
around, the </B>
<P><B>brush was gone. I bent to look on the floor. Not finding it, I stood
up and </B>
<P><B>there was the brush in the sink! I got a little scared. After that,
my things </B>
<P><B>always came up missing. Everyday, I would misplace something only to
</B>
<P><B>find it right back in front of me. It happened whether I was in the
house alone </B>
<P><B>or with everyone at home. I saw the little girl several times always
at night </B>
<P><B>always in my doorway. Even after my sister and her daughter had moved
out. It </B>
<P><B>got to the point when I was so used to having my things taken and then
given </B>
<P><B>back that I would just say, okay, honey, give me back my bracelet or
</B>
<P><B>whatever was missing. Three times I heard a childlike giggle just before
the </B>
<P><B>item was returned. I grew fond of the games she played and was never
afraid of </B>
<P><B>her.</B>
<P><B>   When we moved from the house, I drove back to put the key in </B>
<P><B>the mailbox for the next tenant. As I stepped onto the porch, I heard
a child </B>
<P><B>crying. I peeked in the front window and there she sat in the middle
of the </B>
<P><B>empty living room. Her hands were covering her eyes and she was sobbing.
I knock </B>
<P><B>on the window and she looked up at me. I told her, I'm so very sorry,
</B>
<P><B>honey, but I cannot play with you anymore. I have to leave. I'm sorry.
She </B>
<P><B>smiled at me that sweetest smile and I swear to God, she just vanished.
I was </B>
<P><B>sad knowing I wouldn't see her or play our take and give back game
again. But </B>
<P><B>deep down I knew she somehow understood how much I cared for her. </B>
<P><B>       I think about her sometimes and wonder if she ever shared </B>
<P><B>herself with anyone else. I hope they enjoyed being with her as much
as I did. </B>
<P><B>She shall always have a special place in my heart.</B>

<P>
<P><B>My story isn't very exciting, but I don't think I'd want an exciting
ghost</B>
<P><B>experience.  Our house isn't very old, maybe 15 or so years old, but
this area</B>
<P><B>was mostly farm land b4 so I honestly don't know where my "little
friends"</B>
<P><B>came from.  My parents have heard little children playing and laughing
late at</B>
<P><B>night when we (2 teenagers and me, a college sophomore) in bed and
asleep.</B>
<P><B>Things disapear and turn up in strange places and sometimes, if you
can't find</B>
<P><B>something and start scolding the "ghosts" it'll turn up in a matter
of</B>
<P><B>seconds.  </B>
<P><B>Sometimes, I'll be in the kitchen and leaning aginst the counter and
a</B>
<P><B>"shadow" will fall from the ceiling and just land in front of you.
 My father</B>
<P><B>and brother have seen it too.  I usually run, so does my bro.  The
only other</B>
<P><B>time we've known a presence is once when I had a friend over for the
night.</B>
<P><B>We were laying on my bed talking and we both felt something jump up
on the</B>
<P><B>bed.  Thinking it was my dog, we ignored it until I heard the dog
barking</B>
<P><B>downstairs.  We turned to look and, well, there was nothing there.
 For some</B>
<P><B>strange reason, it didnt' freak us out and we carried on a typical</B>
<P><B>conversation and went to sleep.  </B>
<P><B>I know, it's not much, but what can you do.  They don't do anything
hurtful so</B>
<P><B>we really don't have a reason to dislike or like them.  They're just
here.  I</B>
<P><B>think it's a couple of kids and I don't know what the shadow is, but
it</B>
<P><B>doesn't seem child like so I'd say there are at least 3 ghosts.  Maybe
it was</B>
<P><B>a ghost dog jumping up on my bed to sleep with my friend and I that
one night.</B>
<P><B>Thanks for listening.</B>

<P>
<P><B>This wasn't the first or last but it has always seemed important and
the most</B>
<P><B>genuinely frightening.</B>
<P><B>I guess it was the shock and actual physicality of the entire
experience.</B>
<P><B>I was living in a rented house, particularily non descript, ( you know
70's</B>
<P><B>cream brick, cream carpet, cream walls, brown tiles), one morning around
5pm i</B>
<P><B>awoke and it seemed a figure ,quite large (to my imagination I would
describe</B>
<P><B>him as a lumberjack in apperance, checked shirt &amp; heavy-set)Standing
next to</B>
<P><B>the bed, highlighted by the slight light through the window.</B>
<P><B>I think i shut my eyes tightly thinking that it was an intruder,.</B>
<P><B>It felt like not a second or even a breath , a force was pushing on
my chest. </B>
<P><B>My eyes shot open to entire blackness now but a shadow which was even
darker</B>
<P><B>seemed to be sitting upon me, pushing air out.</B>
<P><B>I think i thrashed around in a hope of throwing it (?) off, i do not
really</B>
<P><B>know.</B>
<P><B>I again openned my eyes to daylight not even a second later.</B>
<P><B>To myself ther always seemed something about this experience which
i should</B>
<P><B>have understood or learnt from ?</B>
<P><B>It still makes me wonder what.</B>

</H3><P><B>By: Starrletzz@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B> </B>
<P>
<P><B>  My expierienes all started when I was baout 10 years old. I woke
up in the</B>
<P><B>middle of the night with an eeire, chilling feeling. At this time both
of my</B>
<P><B>parents were asleep and my cats were outside. I suddenly heard heavy
footsteps</B>
<P><B>walking down the hallway, they continued to my room, My bedroom door
opened</B>
<P><B>and I saw a figure of a man about 6 feet tall and wearing a old-timish
suit. I</B>
<P><B>remember being, not scared but relaxed and I watched as the figure</B>
<P><B>dissappeared in a way a human could not.</B>
<P><B> The next night my dad stayed up late watching TV and about the same
time I</B>
<P><B>spotted the man, My father smelled a very clear smell of some one smoking
a</B>
<P><B>cigar. Neither of my parents smoke. About the same time everynight
he would</B>
<P><B>smell the same smell of someone smoking. </B>
<P><B>  About a year later I stayed up doing homweork and everyone was asleep,
but I</B>
<P><B>heard the foot steps again, My door opened and my light turned off,
but my</B>
<P><B>radio stayed on and so did the hall light, It continued to turn on
and off and</B>
<P><B>then stopped. My door closed and the footsteps continued towards me
but faded</B>
<P><B>out.</B>
<P><B>  About 2 years later we were getting our chimney cleaned and the
chimney</B>
<P><B>cleaner had found a drivers license from 1921 and the man in the license
was</B>
<P><B>the same figure and apperance that has been haunting my house.</B>
<P><B> Every now and then the fugure still appears in my bedroom or messes
with the</B>
<P><B>light fixtures, But he is harmless.</B>

</H3><P><B>BY:  booberdee@yahoo.com</B>
<P>
<P><B> I've sentin stories to other sites before, but I wanted to share a
few </B>
<P><B>experiences with you here.</B>
<P><B>Well, when my parents moved to the apartment my mother still lives
in today, </B>
<P><B>I noticed that it has some quirks... You see, the apartment has a few
</B>
<P><B>mischievous occupants I call gremlins... They tend to take items for
sometime </B>
<P><B>and then relocate them. I will explain...One day, my Mom left $20 in
the front </B>
<P><B>pocket of her jeans. She realized sometime later that she needed to
run to the </B>
<P><B>store, so she went back to her room to get the money. After a few minutes,
she </B>
<P><B>called out to me, saying that she needed help. She couldn't find the
money, so </B>
<P><B>she asked me to look in the pocket. I didn't find it either. I searched
quite a </B>
<P><B>few times before I turned to her and asked if she was mistaken. Had
she taken </B>
<P><B>the money out before? Was she wearing a different pair of jeans? Was
she sure </B>
<P><B>she placed the money in her jeans and not in a jacket? No to each </B>
<P><B>question...Alright, Mom... You know how this house is... Wait for about
20 </B>
<P><B>minutes and look again. Mom did as I suggested, opting to read a book
in </B>
<P><B>the kitchen for a while. After about half an hour, she went back to
check. Where </B>
<P><B>was the money? In the same pocket I had checked at least 6 times thirty
minutes </B>
<P><B>before...She is not the only victim to these little practical </B>
<P><B>jokers... One night, my best friends, Coraly, Mia, and Ralph came over
to </B>
<P><B>chitchat. Sometime later, I felt the need to smoke a cigarette (Newports
at the </B>
<P><B>time). Unfortunately, being a college student, neatness was not my
forte. My </B>
<P><B>coffee table was cluttered with everything from magazines to jewelry.
So, </B>
<P><B>knowing I put my pack on this mountain of stuff, I continued to talk
while I </B>
<P><B>searched. Frustrated after a few moments, I pleaded with my friends
to help me </B>
<P><B>take EVERYTHING off of the table so I could find the Newports. We shook
out </B>
<P><B>magazines, cleared off the table, even threw out some stuff, but the
pack just </B>
<P><B>simply was not there. The closest thing that matched the coloring of
the pack </B>
<P><B>was an empty Noxema carton. Oh well, I figured I&amp;rsquo;d just grab
a cigarette </B>
<P><B>from my Mom. So, we straightened up the table and continued to talk.
After some </B>
<P><B>time, while puffing and chitchatting away, I managed to look at the
table </B>
<P><B>(which, of course, was right in front of me) and saw my pack of cigarettes,
</B>
<P><B>nestled between the pages of a magazine. I said Oh, guys. You are </B>
<P><B>never going to believe this, and picked up the pack. The look of </B>
<P><B>shock on each of their faces was undeniable. Now before this episode,
I had </B>
<P><B>spoken to them about the goings on in my house, but each time I received
a </B>
<P><B>polite sure, whatever you say coupled with an I don't</B>
<P><B>believe you eye-roll. To this day, my friends are believers.</B>
<P><B>I'm positive that these little guys are not the only ones sharing </B>
<P><B>living space with my Mom. One night, Coraly was over for dinner. Doing
</B>
<P><B>our usual thing, we sat in my living room talking of nothing and
everything. </B>
<P><B>Suddenly, it hit me I smelled fried fish! Don't you smell </B>
<P><B>it?, I asked. Of course she didn't, until a few minutes later, when
</B>
<P><B>the smell left me. Back and forth, for over an hour, the smell drifted
between </B>
<P><B>us, changing once in a while to the scent of fresh flowers. After a
while, it </B>
<P><B>faded until we could no longer smell it. I don't know who it was or
what </B>
<P><B>it was trying to say, but it certainly was an interesting experience.

</H3><P><B>By: wyla@worldnetla.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>I'm not sure why I'm doing this...ghost as such don't bother me. I've</B>
<P><B>been around them all my life. I've had them breath on my neck, call
my</B>
<P><B>name, open doors, move things....I've even seen them. What bothers
me</B>
<P><B>and what I would like to talk to you about happened two years ago.
 It</B>
<P><B>was dusk and I was cooking supper...there's a window in my kitchen</B>
<P><B>that's over the stove, it looks out onto the carport. I had gone
outside</B>
<P><B>to empty the garbage when I saw a shadow...it was solid black....about
6</B>
<P><B>feet tall...and it was looking in the kitchen window. Thinking it was
my</B>
<P><B>son trying to scare me, I called his name. The shadow turned and
looked</B>
<P><B>at me, then I watched as it ran off the carport....only it
dissappeared</B>
<P><B>before it got to the edge of the carport ( it's 24 feet from the
window</B>
<P><B>to the edge of the concret) Still thinking it was Jason, I went in
the</B>
<P><B>house laughing until I walked in his room and he was sitting on his
bed.</B>
<P><B>Thinking back, the shadow had no face...there were no white to it's
eyes</B>
<P><B>or even eyes. That's why I call it a shadow.  My kids and thier
friends</B>
<P><B>have told me stories about the ghost in the barn....one night , right
at</B>
<P><B>sunset, my son chased it around the barn...until he realized his were</B>
<P><B>the only footprints in the grass. I'm not even sure why this bothers</B>
<P><B>me.......I haven't seen it again but I did notice a nose print on the</B>
<P><B>outside of one of the one sunroom windows.</B>

<P>
<P><B>Having just sent you an e-mail saying that I don't have time, I'm
going</B>
<P><B>to send you a couple of stories, anyway.  Typical contributor, no?
 I</B>
<P><B>have a couple of stories from Peru, this being the first of them.</B>
<P>
<P><B>My wife is from Puno, Peru.  It's a beautiful place, full of clean</B>
<P><B>streets and friendly people, the town climbing up the mountains from
the</B>
<P><B>shore of Lake Titicaca to the edge of the highland pampas.  A
thoroughly</B>
<P><B>unlikely-looking place for hauntings.  In the center of town, on a</B>
<P><B>corner of the Plaza de Armas, across from the Cathedral, is the</B>
<P><B>crumbling ruin of an old Spanish adobe building.  It is the former
home</B>
<P><B>of the Conde de Lemnos, one of the Viceroys from Spain, and a place</B>
<P><B>feared by everyone in the neighborhood.</B>
<P>
<P><B>In the 17th century the Conde de Lemnos, the Viceroy of Peru, was
known</B>
<P><B>as a particularly evil, cruel despot.  In Puno the family Laycacota</B>
<P><B>struck an extremely rich vein of silver ore, so rich that they
quickly</B>
<P><B>became the greatest power in the Andean highlands.  The Viceroy lost</B>
<P><B>patience and went after the Laycacotas with an army.  They barricaded</B>
<P><B>themselves in their mine, several dozen men, women and children, well</B>
<P><B>supplied with food and munitions.  As the siege extended into several</B>
<P><B>months the Conde took over their house on the Plaza and the
Laycacotas</B>
<P><B>began to starve.  When the women and children were sent out, to save</B>
<P><B>them from the suffering, the Conde proceeded to kill them in front
of</B>
<P><B>the barricaded holdouts.  When the men finally ran out of powder he
had</B>
<P><B>them all burned alive in the mine.</B>
<P>
<P><B>His house has noises and lights that appear and move around that are</B>
<P><B>discernible from the street.  The police station is next door, and
a</B>
<P><B>small store is around the corner, on the other side of the house. 
The</B>
<P><B>police will walk all the way around the block to get to the store at</B>
<P><B>night, rather than cross in front of it.  Several people have
purchased</B>
<P><B>the property, and all have gone on to financial ruin.  The last
people</B>
<P><B>to spend a night in the house were a young German couple on their</B>
<P><B>honeymoon.  They were accomplished sailors, having crossed the
Atlantic</B>
<P><B>on the first stage of their trip.  After a noisy, restless night they</B>
<P><B>took a sailboat out on Lake Titicaca.  The boat capsized in a high
wind</B>
<P><B>and both drowned.</B>
<P><B>The house is still empty today.</B>

<P>
<P><B>Love your page! I've been checking out similar pages for a few months</B>
<P><B>now (due to some weird stuff happening, but we'll get to that later),</B>
<P><B>and yours is the one I've found most readable and helpful.  It also
has</B>
<P><B>the best links page on the web, IMO.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Anyway; stories...</B>
<P>
<P><B>Although I'm basically a skeptic about things like ghosts and angels
and</B>
<P><B>all, I've always felt that there's more to heaven and earth than is</B>
<P><B>dreamt of in our philosophy (etc., etc.) and I try to keep an open
mind.</B>
<P><B>Three things have happened in my life that tend to make me think that</B>
<P><B>ghosts (or something like them) probably do exist.</B>
<P>
<P><B>1.) When I was about 8 years old (maybe 9), my brother and I were
alone</B>
<P><B>in the house one night.  My parents were divorced, we lived with my</B>
<P><B>Dad.  Dad had a lady friend next door he was visiting (now she's my</B>
<P><B>step-mom) at the time, but since it was right next door and my
brother</B>
<P><B>was 2 years older than me, he felt o.k. about leaving us; we had the</B>
<P><B>phone number as well.</B>
<P><B>    We were supposed to be asleep, but I was having a hard time</B>
<P><B>sleeping.  I had this feeling of fear and sadness that felt like it
was</B>
<P><B>coming from outside of myself.  I was an analytical child, and kept</B>
<P><B>telling myself that I was feeling my own fear and sadness because we</B>
<P><B>were alone and because I was a tad jealous of my Dad's new
girlfriend,</B>
<P><B>but the feelings just intensified as the minutes went by.</B>
<P><B>    My room was dark, but the door to the hallway was open and the
light</B>
<P><B>was on in the hall.  Suddenly, I felt I should keep still.  I didn't</B>
<P><B>hear a noise or anything, I just felt scared stiff.  A man walked
into</B>
<P><B>the hallway from the living room.  I saw him so clearly; he was a
very</B>
<P><B>young man, maybe only 18.  He was black; his face was clean-shaven
and</B>
<P><B>quite handsome. He was dressed in jeans and a sweatshirt and he was</B>
<P><B>carrying his sneakers over his shoulder; he was in his stocking feet,
as</B>
<P><B>though he was trying to be very quiet.  Of course, I thought he was
a</B>
<P><B>robber.  I lay very quiet and tried to "squinch" my eyes shut so I
could</B>
<P><B>still see him, but my eyes looked shut.  He stared into my room for
a</B>
<P><B>long time, then silently proceeded down the hall to my father's room.</B>
<P><B>I knew he would have to pass by me again; there was no way out of my</B>
<P><B>father's room except through the window, and the hallway ended there;</B>
<P><B>there were no other rooms off the hall.</B>
<P><B>    I waited and waited, but he didn't come out; there was no sound
at</B>
<P><B>all, but he must be in there still.  I finally decided I couldn't
stand</B>
<P><B>it any more and I would sneak down the hall myself and get to the
phone</B>
<P><B>in the kitchen and call my Dad.  It took a lot of guts, but I did it.
</B>
<P><B>When I got to the kitchen, though, there was the man!!  He was
standing</B>
<P><B>by the kitchen door; how did he get there?  There was no way he could</B>
<P><B>have climbed out my father's window and come back in, because I would</B>
<P><B>have heard him, and anyway, the door was locked.</B>
<P><B>    I don't know why, but I suddenly didn't feel all that scared; he</B>
<P><B>seemed so frightened of me!  He seemed lost and disoriented.  I
finally</B>
<P><B>got my throat working and squeaked out "Who are you?".  His eyes</B>
<P><B>widened, as though he was surprised or frightened and... he vanished.
</B>
<P><B>I'm not kidding; he disappeared.  The kitchen door banged, but I
swear</B>
<P><B>it didn't open or close.  I called my Dad, and when he got there, the</B>
<P><B>door was locked; he had to use his key to get in.</B>
<P><B>    Nothing in the house was missing or disturbed; my Dad's window
was</B>
<P><B>shut tight and all the doors were locked.  My brother didn't see or
hear</B>
<P><B>anything.  Of course, everybody thinks I dreamt it or made it up, but
I</B>
<P><B>know I didn't.</B>
<P>
<P><B>2.) When I was about 14, I was at a friend's house and we decided to</B>
<P><B>play with her Ouija board (I know, I know, it was dangerous, but we</B>
<P><B>didn't know that).</B>
<P><B>    Neither of us were serious about it, and were giggling and being</B>
<P><B>generally silly; asking the board stupid questions about who we were</B>
<P><B>going to marry, etc..  I can't remember who said it, but one of us
asked</B>
<P><B>if there was a spirit present.  Suddenly, the little thingy you put
your</B>
<P><B>fingers on (I forget what they call it) was literally jerked out from</B>
<P><B>under my fingers and flew across the room.  Predictably, we screamed
and</B>
<P><B>ran out of the room.  Later, when we were calmer and went to put the</B>
<P><B>board away, I was surprised to find that my friend was kind of mad
at me</B>
<P><B>for "playing such a mean joke".  I was just thinking the same thing</B>
<P><B>about her, and told her so!  We both claimed that the other person
had</B>
<P><B>made the thing fly off the board like that.</B>
<P><B>    To this day, she says she didn't do it, and I know I didn't.  One</B>
<P><B>thing's for sure, we never played with the Ouija board again.  If I
ever</B>
<P><B>find out she was lying, though, she's in big trouble!</B>
<P>
<P><B>3.)  Just recently, I started getting the feeling of "not being
alone"</B>
<P><B>in the basement/family room of our house.  I sometimes thought I
heard</B>
<P><B>whispering or soft singing, and a couple of times I could swear
someone</B>
<P><B>called my name.  I was tempted to put this down to my overactive</B>
<P><B>imagination, but then our dog developed the habit of leaping up and</B>
<P><B>barking hysterically at nothing, then lying down again (rather</B>
<P><B>sheepishy!).  I started looking on the web and found numerous
pictures</B>
<P><B>that people had taken of things that weren't visible to the naked eye
at</B>
<P><B>the time the picture was taken, and I thought "Aha! I'll try that,
and</B>
<P><B>see if I get anything!".  I went down to the basement with our
digital</B>
<P><B>camera, mentally asked "whoever" to show it/him/herself, and snapped
a</B>
<P><B>picture.  Several "orbs" appeared in it!  I tried again; even more</B>
<P><B>"orbs"!</B>
<P><B>    The next morning, my 11-year-old son complained that he had been</B>
<P><B>awakened early by a "moaning" sound, and by his bed being shaken</B>
<P><B>roughly.  I had told him nothing of my feelings about the house, or
the</B>
<P><B>pictures I took.  I told my son he must have been dreaming (I didn't</B>
<P><B>want to scare him, especially since he could have dreamt it; I don't</B>
<P><B>know).  When I was alone in my son's room, I asked "whoever" to
please</B>
<P><B>not frighten my son.  There has not been a repeat incident.</B>
<P><B>    For weeks afterward, almost every picture I took in every room
of</B>
<P><B>the house had one or more "orbs" in it.  I wanted to know if this was
a</B>
<P><B>defect in the camera, so I searched on the web for information.  Some</B>
<P><B>folk claim that with digital cameras in particular, you can get an
"orb"</B>
<P><B>effect because of dust particles in the air quite close to the lens.
</B>
<P><B>So.  I felt a bit relieved in a way (and maybe just a little</B>
<P><B>disappointed), and decided I had imagined the whole thing.  On the
very</B>
<P><B>day this happened, though, the orbs disappeared from my pictures. 
The</B>
<P><B>whispering and singing and feelings of being watched stopped, too,
and</B>
<P><B>the dog has settled down.</B>
<P><B>    Now, I'm not sure what to think.  It's almost as though I'm doing
it</B>
<P><B>somehow;  when I believe something's happening it does.  When I
don't,</B>
<P><B>it doesn't.  There was a death in the basement/family room a couple</B>
<P><B>years ago due to a freak accident, and maybe that just has my</B>
<P><B>imagination working overtime; what do you think?</B>

<H3><B><A NAME=hospital>T.B. Hospital in Louisville, Ky</A></B>
</H3><P><B>By: HARPER1469@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>Louisville Kentucky - Waverly Hills T.B. Sanatorium</B>
<P><B>On November 30, 1998 myself and two of my friends witnessed an number
of</B>
<P><B>paranormal occurences while ghost hunting in the Waverly Hills T.B.
</B>
<P><B>Sanatorium.  I had heard several different rumors about the place since
I was</B>
<P><B>in</B> <B>10th grade and was determined to find out the truth for myself.
 The place is</B>
<P><B>huge</B> <B>and their are other buildings but the main hospital is
the place where there</B>
<P><B>have been sightings and noises and other things reported.  It was closed
by the</B>
<P><B>state</B> <B>in 1961 and re-opened as a nursing home but was once again
closed in 1980</B>
<P><B>allegedly because of poor patient treatment.  Anyway,  We arrived their
at</B>
<P><B>about 9:00 p.m. and were in the building about 15 minutes after that
due to the long</B>
<P><B>walk up the hill and into the woods.  It's totaly isolated.  When we
finaly</B>
<P><B>got to the top of the hill we walked to the front. Now, when I saw
this place</B>
<P><B>I stood there in disbeleif because this place looks so scary and creepy
and</B>
<P><B>erie that it looks like someone set it up to film a movie there, I
swear!</B>
<P><B>It''s unbeleivable.( I swear I'm telling the truth).  In fact, I started
to</B>
<P><B>have second thoughts about it.  I felt like I was in a horror movie.
 After we</B>
<P><B>walked in through one of the many entrances that stand wide open I
could  tell</B>
<P><B>that something was unsettled in this place.  I just felt like If I
turned</B>
<P><B>around I would see something following us.  The atmosphere completely
changed.</B>
<P><B>We walked through the hallways and wen't into rooms where patients
were held.</B>
<P><B>You could see scratch marks all over many of the doors and walls and
when we</B>
<P><B>got to the basement we saw blood stains.  No more than a second after
we all</B>
<P><B>saw the blood we heard footsteps upstairs for about 30 or 40 seconds.
 We</B>
<P><B>ignored the sounds and headed towards a door in hopes of escaping to
the</B>
<P><B>outside only to find a long tunnel that we could see down for about
15 feet.</B>
<P><B>We walked in and walked for about 6or7 minutes but ended up stopping
hudled up</B>
<P><B>because after stopping to smoke, we heard footsteps and scuffeling
noises</B>
<P><B>behind us.  We decided to get back up to the first floor and than leave.
 We</B>
<P><B>got to the top of the stairs and finaly found our way out.  We were
taking</B>
<P><B>pictures of the outside when my friend saw what we originaly came to
find.  In</B>
<P><B>the third floor at the 5th window on the right side of the building
we all saw</B>
<P><B>a young femal child just staring at us.</B>
<P><B>I swear this is what happened and none of this event is a lie.  I would
say</B>
<P><B>that this place is worth looking into and should be investigated by
paranormal</B>
<P><B>researchers.  I would be willing to help.  If you would like to respond
back</B>
<P><B>to me personally my e-mail address is: Harper1469@AOL.com  (please
reply, I</B>
<P><B>would like to know if you or anyone is interested) </B>

</H3><P><B>By:  scitizen@sover.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>I am living in a 200 year old house which was dismantled and moved
from its</B>
<P><B>former location in Eagle Bridge, NY.  As I was moving in, I became
aware of</B>
<P><B>music playing faintly and I was not able to determine its source. 
I sat at</B>
<P><B>my desk one day to pay my bills and noticed the surface was extremely
hot</B>
<P><B>in one small area, about the size of my hand.  The desk everywhere
else was</B>
<P><B>cool to my touch, as wood is normally.  I also noticed the faint smells
of</B>
<P><B>old roses and some type of animal.  One morning I got up to go out
for a</B>
<P><B>walk before work; I put on my watch and checked the time, which I
believed</B>
<P><B>to be 7:05 a.m.  After walking a distance, I again checked my watch
and</B>
<P><B>discovered it had stopped, which I did not understand as the battery
was</B>
<P><B>new.  Later that day, I discovered I had put my watch on upside down
so it</B>
<P><B>had actually stopped at 1:35 a.m., and the stem was pulled out.  I
reset it</B>
<P><B>and wore it all day.  When I took it off to go to bed that night, I
checked</B>
<P><B>it and it was running.  I placed it on the table in the bedroom and
the</B>
<P><B>next morning discovered it had stopped at 1:35 a.m. and the stem was
pulled</B>
<P><B>out.  Several days later, my watch disappeared entirely.  Mysteriously,
it</B>
<P><B>was found in the middle of my 15 acre field, where I had not been.
 Shortly</B>
<P><B>after that, it disappeared again and I have not found it.  There is
always</B>
<P><B>a great deal of interference in my telephone, TV, stereo, clocks, and
my</B>
<P><B>clothes dryer has even started to run on its own.  One night I was
coming</B>
<P><B>down my stairs and felt something grab me by the wrist.  There is a
brick</B>
<P><B>which holds the kitchen door open (the location is extremely windy
most of</B>
<P><B>the time) and it disappeared for over a week.  I found it in a drawer
and I</B>
<P><B>am certain it was not placed there by anyone living in the house.
 This</B>
<P><B>happened again after a visit from the owner--the very same night I
told him</B>
<P><B>about its previous disappearance.  The can opener also disappeared
for over</B>
<P><B>a week and then suddenly appeared in an obvious place, where I could
not</B>
<P><B>have missed it had it really been there all along. Before I met the
current</B>
<P><B>owner of the house, during a phone converstation, I told him I kept
hearing</B>
<P><B>music but couldn't figure out where it was coming from.  He asked,
"Are you</B>
<P><B>afraid?"  I then asked him what he had not told me about the house.
 I</B>
<P><B>learned he had purchased it from a Jehovah named George Peabody
because</B>
<P><B>George had bad experiences (unidentified) in the house and with
articles</B>
<P><B>removed from the house so he believed the house was inhabited by
demonic</B>
<P><B>spirits.  I also learned the last residents of the house were two
spinsters</B>
<P><B>and their pet baboon--about 15 years ago.  Apparently one of the women
died</B>
<P><B>in the house and her body could not be removed without killing the
baboon. </B>
<P><B>The current owner also told me that he'd experienced strange happenings
and</B>
<P><B>so had his father; they are both Baptist ministers.  Over the recent</B>
<P><B>Thanksgiving holiday, I bought a new mattress.  When I removed the
old one,</B>
<P><B>I discovered several pools of dried blood under the bed which I can't</B>
<P><B>explain.  Stranger still, on the mattress pad on the other bed in the
same</B>
<P><B>room I found a ring of dried blood.  There was no blood on the sheets
or on</B>
<P><B>the mattress and the pad was new; the bed had not been ever slept in.
 The</B>
<P><B>house is now in White Creek, NY and is on the National Register of
Historic</B>
<P><B>Houses.  Grandma Moses lived in the house as a child servant.  The
house</B>
<P><B>was a part of the Underground Railroad and was both a parsonage and
a</B>
<P><B>funeral home.  I am not afraid and apparently there have been
articles</B>
<P><B>written about the house and its ghosts, which I am trying to locate.
 I am</B>
<P><B>also interested in knowing about the people who have lived in the house
but</B>
<P><B>have not had time to research..</B>

</H3><P><B>By:  ped@ideal.net.au</B>
<P>
<P><B>Hi Dave.</B>
<P><B>My name is Fiona and I live in Australia.</B>
<P><B>My husband Paul and I are currently compiling a book on peoples
experiences</B>
<P><B>of the supernatural and I thought that I would share a little of our
own</B>
<P><B>experiences with you.</B>
<P><B>We bought our first home in August 1994 and moved in with our then,
8 month</B>
<P><B>old son James.</B>
<P><B>Things were wonderful for about ayear and a half and then in early
1996 we</B>
<P><B>went to visit my grandmothers grave to lay flowers.</B>
<P><B>We arrived home late afternoon and put James down for a nap. We then
decided</B>
<P><B>to have one ourselves and laid down hoping to catch at least an hour.
(at</B>
<P><B>that time our son didn't sleep too well.) Well we had barely laid our
heads</B>
<P><B>down when Paul began to tell me to stop it.</B>
<P><B>Well you can imagine that I didn't know what on earth he was talking
about,</B>
<P><B>so I said stop what?</B>
<P><B>He went on to tell me that I had been tickling his backside and that
he</B>
<P><B>wasn't really in the mood so I should just cut it out.</B>
<P><B>After about half an hour I finally convinced him that I hadn't been
touching</B>
<P><B>him and he gave up the argument.</B>
<P><B>Well let me tell you since then we have experienced nothing short of
a</B>
<P><B>paranormal invasion.</B>
<P><B>Lights turn on and off by themselves, food is constantly stacked up
in the</B>
<P><B>pantry in the most unusual ways, things actually go flying accross
the room</B>
<P><B>right in front of your face and general confusion reigns.</B>
<P><B>These occurences continued on a daily basis. And in 1997 when i was
about</B>
<P><B>eight months pregnant with our second child i experienced the most</B>
<P><B>unbelievable experience yet.</B>
<P><B>I was watching a childrens program with james, then almost three, when
right</B>
<P><B>before my eyes a young boy, looking to be about five appeared. I
couldn't</B>
<P><B>say where he came from, he was just simply there.</B>
<P><B>At first the thought of a ghost didn't even enter my head i just
thought,</B>
<P><B>there is a child in our house!</B>
<P><B>It was then that he walked into the hallway. So i got up very casually
and</B>
<P><B>followed him. Without mentioning any thing to james. I followed him
through</B>
<P><B>the hall and he turned left into james room. But as you can probably
guess</B>
<P><B>when i went in he had gone. When i came back into the living room
james</B>
<P><B>looked up at me very innocently and said, Did you see the little boy?
He</B>
<P><B>then explained that his name was michael and that he played in his
room with</B>
<P><B>him all the time.</B>
<P><B>I wasn't too disturbed by it rather i was intrigued. I had always had
a</B>
<P><B>fascination with the supernatural so it was of great interest to me.</B>
<P><B>I explained it all to my husband when he got home and i think he thought
i</B>
<P><B>was imagining things, being pregnant and all. ( at the time he was
a bit of</B>
<P><B>a sceptic.) But when he had his evening shower he soon changed his
mind.</B>
<P>
<P><B>He was just finishing up in the shower when he knocked on the wall.
We</B>
<P><B>usually knock on the wall when either of us is in there and ask whether
the</B>
<P><B>other one wants it after us and we will then leave it running.</B>
<P><B>So i went in to see what he wanted and he said The showers ready for
you.</B>
<P><B>I said no thanks, iv'e already had one.</B>
<P><B>He then yurned to me and said well then why did you ask me to leave
it</B>
<P><B>running?</B>
<P><B>I said that i hadn't and he went on to tell me that i had opened the
door,</B>
<P><B>entered the bathroom and said leave it running for me when your
finished</B>
<P><B>paul! and then i had left the room.</B>
<P><B>Well i certainly hadn't done that and it took a lot of talking to
convince</B>
<P><B>him otherwise.</B>
<P><B>There are plenty more stories to tell, as i write this email things
are</B>
<P><B>still occurring. the most frequent things are Voices on a tape that
we have</B>
<P><B>our little boy singing on. voices that definately weren't there
before.</B>
<P><B>I just yesterday bumped into an invisible figure in the hallway and
the tv</B>
<P><B>remote control was thrown accross the room.</B>
<P><B>There are too many things to even mention here they would fit into
a book.</B>
<P><B>Hey maybe i'll do that next.</B>
<P><B>P.S If anybody would like to tell us of their experiences for our book
we</B>
<P><B>would love to hear from you.</B>

<P>
<P><B>I have had an unearthly(scuse the pun) amount of experiences over the</B>
<P><B>course of my 34 years.My mother,her mother and her mother before</B>
<P><B>her,have unusual abilities,for lack of a better term.I was born the</B>
<P><B>same,as was my daughter now.My mother is able to communicate with
people</B>
<P><B>that have passed on and this is her account.I will tell it as she
told</B>
<P><B>me.</B>
<P>
<P><B>"About three days before your brother(much older than I) was
born,your</B>
<P><B>grandfather,myfather,passed away of a heart attack,in his sleep.He
and I</B>
<P><B>were very close,as I never had a good relationship with my mother,we</B>
<P><B>seldom saw eye to eye,and so my father was my hero.</B>
<P>
<P><B>When I heard of his death I was devastated,and went into labour with</B>
<P><B>your brother 3 days later.I cried for joy at the sight of my new
son,but</B>
<P><B>also for pure sadness that my own father wouldnt be able to see
him,or</B>
<P><B>so I thought.</B>
<P><B>I believe in the afterworld,I know when we die,our spirits,our souls
are</B>
<P><B>released from the earthly body.This belief became more convincing when
I</B>
<P><B>experienced it first hand.</B>
<P>
<P><B>When your brother was 6 months old, I became depressed at the thought
of</B>
<P><B>my dead father,I was still mourning the loss,and I had good days and</B>
<P><B>bad.It was summer,a gorgeous warm day,and so the inner door was open
and</B>
<P><B>the screen door was closed,but still allowing a breeze.I was doing
some</B>
<P><B>housecleaning when I thought of your grandfather,and started to feel</B>
<P><B>sad,when there was a knock at the screen door.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I wasnt expecting anyone,and assumed it was a salesman.As I entered
the</B>
<P><B>front hall,.I saw a tall slim man with his back to me and wondered
who</B>
<P><B>the dickens this was at 2 in the afternoon.I opened the screen door
and</B>
<P><B>said "can I help you" The man turned and let me see that it was my</B>
<P><B>father! I was astounded,shocked,scared,every emotion possible zoomed</B>
<P><B>thro me within a few seconds.He smiled at me gently,and without moving
a</B>
<P><B>muscle said "Your Uncle Sam will pass away 2 weeks from this day,at</B>
<P><B>exactly 6am.Then he vanished.I thoguht maybe the depression was
getting</B>
<P><B>to me and I was imagining things. Two weeks to the day at 6am my</B>
<P><B>wonderful Uncle Sam passed away in his sleep.I was again devastated
at</B>
<P><B>loosing another very important person in my life.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Shortly after that,my father again came to me,with news of another</B>
<P><B>relative passing on.IT happened as he said,when he said and I thought
I</B>
<P><B>was going crazy.Needless to say,I never told a soul what was going
on,it</B>
<P><B>was the 50's and they would have tried to put me in a hospital</B>
<P>
<P><B>About 3 months after the last visit,my sister had come for coffee in
the</B>
<P><B>afternoon,I was busy doing something,probably changing a diaper when
the</B>
<P><B>door bell rang.I yelled at my sister to please answer it as I had my</B>
<P><B>hands full</B>
<P>
<P><B>About 1 min later I heard a god aweful scream and rushed to see what
it</B>
<P><B>was.My sister stood frozen at the door,door wide open and no one
there.</B>
<P><B>Iasked her what the matter was and she said "Dad" just that, nothing</B>
<P><B>else and I knew that Dad had come to visit again.WHen she calmed down</B>
<P><B>she made me swear that I was NOT to tell a soul about what she heard
or</B>
<P><B>saw,and that when she was done telling me,we would never bring it up</B>
<P><B>again.She said "Dad told me that such and such was going to die on
this</B>
<P><B>date at that time and then he vanished" I told her that he had come
to</B>
<P><B>me also with the same kind of news.We never spoke of it again,even
now</B>
<P><B>some 40 odd years later.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Dad came to me one last time,but before he could speak I said to him</B>
<P><B>"Dad I love you,and I miss you terribly but I cant stand hearing
about</B>
<P><B>relatives dying I dont want to know the future,please dont tell me"</B>
<P><B>Dad smiled at me,winked his eye,as was his habit and said "pet,iam
so</B>
<P><B>sorry I caused you such pain and fear,and I will never come to you
in</B>
<P><B>this form again,but know that I will be with you always,you only need</B>
<P><B>ask,and my grandson is beautiful"</B>
<P>
<P><B>He kept his promise,he never again came to me in that form but hes
come</B>
<P><B>to me often in my time of need,Ican feel his presence and his love
and</B>
<P><B>warmth. Your brother looks very much like your grandfather,almost his</B>
<P><B>spittin image,and it was your grandfathers ring that saved your
brothers</B>
<P><B>finger when he almost lost it using a band saw.</B>
<P><B>I know now that your Grandfather is your brothers guardian angel"</B>

<P>
<P><B>I grew up in a little town in Maine....in a large house--we had few
neighbors and </B>
<P><B>lived on a basically deserted street....All of my family members, except
my father, </B>
<P><B>experienced very weird, strange things.... </B>

in our </B>

about a </B>
<P><B>foot off the floor.  Three of them were adults-the one in the middle
was smaller </B>
<P><B>than the other two.  One very small creating was floating above them.
 They were </B>
<P><B>an opaque/white/transparent color, with very, very large black eyes.
 I sensed that </B>
<P><B>they were totally chaotic, but not necessary evil.  It felt as though
they were very </B>
<P><B>mischevious.   At this point in time, the upstairs was only half finished.
 They </B>
<P><B>literally melted into the door that led into the unfinished portion
of the upstairs.  </B>
<P><B>They just passed right through the door like it wasn't even there.
 That was the most </B>
<P><B>frightening experience I've ever had.  I never saw them again.  Sometimes
I have </B>
<P><B>wondered if I were having a dream that night, but the memory of them
is so vivid </B>
<P><B>that I believe that I actually experienced this unusual phenomena.
</B>
<P>
<P><B>My brothers both had experiences as well-my oldest brother was
upstairs-after it </B>
<P><B>was finished--and he felt something walk by him.  It was a palpable
feeling that </B>
<P><B>someone/something was brushing his shoulder to get by him. </B>
<P>
<P><B>At other times, I heard footsteps upstairs when there was no one home
but me.  The </B>
<P><B>footsteps always led into my bedroom, the room I felt was especially
haunted.... </B>
<P>
<P><B>My younger brother experienced something as well.  He was in bed one
night-he </B>
<P><B>was about 5 or 6 years old when he saw what he describes as a "bright
red flying </B>
<P><B>bat"  he says it was glowing and that it emanated a very evil presence.
 He said </B>
<P><B>he was paralyzed with fear and felt unable to leave his bed. </B>
<P>
<P><B>My mother and my oldest brother have heard voices which chant--my sister
was </B>
<P><B>about 12 years old and she was sleeping/or in some kind of a trance
in her room </B>
<P><B>when my brother came running downstairs to tell my mother about the
voices he </B>
<P><B>was hearing in her room.  My mother immediately went to my sister's
bedroom-the </B>
<P><B>haunted room upstairs--and also heard voices chanting the same chant
over and </B>
<P><B>over again.  My sister was apparently in a very deep sleep--my mother
tried to </B>
<P><B>walk her, but she would not wake up.  My mother finally dragged my
sister out of </B>
<P><B>the room and down the stairs.  Finally, my sister awoke, but had no
idea of how she </B>
<P><B>got downstairs, or what had happened to her. </B>
<P>
<P><B>I don't know if I really believe in ghosts or not, but it seems that
for a while, </B>
<P><B>something inhabited our home that can only be labelled as "evil".
 Eventually, </B>
<P><B>the evil spirit left, but my Mother takes no chances--there are religious
</B>
<P><B>symbols/pictures in almost every room of the house.

<P><B>    I can't remember a lot of my childhood but my mother has informed
me</B>
<P><B>about this part.  She said it started when I was about five years</B>
<P><B>old.... my mother would catch me starting into space and laughing.
 When</B>
<P><B>she asked me what I was laughing at my reply would be simply "look
he's</B>
<P><B>funny."  Although I don't remember this to be true or what exactly
it</B>
<P><B>was I assume it was some sort of ghost.</B>
<P><B>    When I was about ten years old I loved to be out doors and spent</B>
<P><B>most of my time in the woods behind our house.  I can still remember</B>
<P><B>this like it was yesterday.  I was taking my normal walk through one
of</B>
<P><B>our trails and saw something in the corner of my eye.  A figure of
a man</B>
<P><B>stood on a trail that was directly right from me.  He suddenly turned</B>
<P><B>and started walking down the trail.  He then went around a corner and
I</B>
<P><B>lost sight of him.  The strange thing about him was that he was
dressed</B>
<P><B>in winter clothes (almost like hunting gear) with a coat, hat, and
all.</B>
<P><B>I really didn't get a good look at him that time.  About two days
later</B>
<P><B>me and my brother were walking through the woods and saw the same
figure</B>
<P><B>in a tree (my brother pointed him out).  He was hazy kind of.  Any
way</B>
<P><B>we both looked at each other and looked back in the tree and he was</B>
<P><B>gone.  Then we high tailed it out of there.</B>
<P><B>    About three years after that some thing even wierder happened.
 I</B>
<P><B>would go into my room to go to bed and either when I was in bed or</B>
<P><B>getting ready to my closet would open.  But when I would look at it,
it</B>
<P><B>would either freeze in the position it ws in or slam shut.  I talked
to</B>
<P><B>my mother about it and she convinced me that it was wind currents
(this</B>
<P><B>started in late summer so I had my windows open).  But as the months</B>
<P><B>passed these events did not stop.  In fact they grew worse.  The
window</B>
<P><B>was now shut and the door would still do it.  I lived in a old
farmhouse</B>
<P><B>and there was no heating duct in my room.  This lasted for about a
year.</B>
<P>
<P><B>    Ever since that started happening, I have not had any peace.
 Lights</B>
<P><B>come on, doors slam, sounds of footsteps would echo in the halls,
ect.</B>
<P><B>Some of my frineds even witnessed these events but the central focus</B>
<P><B>always seemed to be on me.</B>
<P><B>    Now I'm in college and wouldn't you just know that I move into
a</B>
<P><B>dorm that has a repetion for being haunted, go figure.  I have</B>
<P><B>experienced drawers opening and closing, closet doors coming open,</B>
<P><B>sudden heating of my room that lasts only seconds, and of course the</B>
<P><B>uneasiness that follows.</B>
<P><B>    I get scared still from these events but the truth is I am kind
of</B>
<P><B>use to it too.  My only queston is why do these things follow me? 
It</B>
<P><B>seems that no matter where I go I'm haunted.  These are only a few
of</B>
<P><B>the encounters I have experienced and in my mind I know that they</B>
<P><B>probally won't be the last of them either.</B>

<P><B>Seeing ghosts is something that kind of runs in the family. Most of
my</B>
<P><B>family on my mothers side have consistant stories of seeing ghosts
dated</B>
<P><B>back too far to remember. This really isn't so strange considering
all</B>
<P><B>my relatives but myself were born and bred in England.I seem to have</B>
<P><B>carried on the family trait.</B>
<P><B>Now don't get me wrong. I am just an ordinary mom with two teenage</B>
<P><B>daughters. I not a mental case and I don't have a hidden stash of
Prozac</B>
<P><B>any where. I am not a firm believer in any thing  really, but I do
see</B>
<P><B>ghosts.</B>
<P><B>My last encounter was just a few years ago. I had just moved to
Missouri</B>
<P><B>and I had rented a fairly old farm house that was in great condition.</B>
<P><B>The house belonged to a woman in her 70's who had recently remarried
and</B>
<P><B>had moved to another town. At first I hadn't noticed too  much
 because</B>
<P><B>I was trying to get settled in a new town and deal with an
overbearing</B>
<P><B>mother-law. Plus to add to matters, the lady I was renting from was</B>
<P><B>always around puttering in the garden in the back of the house or</B>
<P><B>staying the garage. (I secretly think back then, she thought I was
going</B>
<P><B>to steal one on of her prize tomatoes.The elderly can be pretty
strange</B>
<P><B>sometimes, especially when your a "foreigner from California".)</B>
<P><B>After I had been there for a few weeks, I started noticeing things.</B>
<P><B>While cleaning the master bathroom.I watch the faucet to the bathroom</B>
<P><B>sink turn on to a full stream and then turn off. Ok, it might be</B>
<P><B>explainable. A week or so later, I was in the kitchen baking and I
saw</B>
<P><B>something in the corner of my eye. I turned around, an low and
behold,</B>
<P><B>there is a male ghost standing in my kitchen with his hands on his</B>
<P><B>hips.The look on his face was if to say "what the hell are you doing</B>
<P><B>here?!". A little unnerving to say the least. Especially, since he</B>
<P><B>looked about 6' and probably out weighed me by at least 100lbs.But
that</B>
<P><B>I could handle that. What I could not handle was when he turned my
alarm</B>
<P><B>clock on at 4am in the morning for the daily fishing and farm report</B>
<P><B>even after the power had gone out and I had not reset the clock.</B>
<P><B>I didn't get to stay in the house very long. After three months of
no</B>
<P><B>privacy from the land lady, I had to move out. Later, I was
approached</B>
<P><B>by her son. He had confided in me that no one stayed in the house
long.</B>
<P><B>Personally, I think she knew it was her deceased husband lurking in
the</B>
<P><B>house and they both didn't want to share it with anyone. Not even her</B>
<P><B>newly married third husband.</B>

<P>
<P><B>I was about 11 years old, and at a small primary school in a small</B>
<P><B>village in Scotland.   At lunch breaks me and a group of my friends</B>
<P><B>would sneak out of the school grounds and go to the woods behind the</B>
<P><B>school.   It was part of our daily routine, we would run along the
dryed</B>
<P><B>up river bed, sit in someones tree house, and then end up sitting
with</B>
<P><B>our backs against the school wall so we could hear the bell ring for
the</B>
<P><B>end of lunch break.    There was a small bridge to the right of where
we</B>
<P><B>sat, so when people came by we would have to pretend that we were
meant</B>
<P><B>to be there doing a project or something.   This particular day we
were</B>
<P><B>feeling extra rebellious and didn't care whether someone came across
the</B>
<P><B>bridge or not.   So when three girls camee over the bridge with thier</B>
<P><B>backs to where we were I stared at them daring them to see us and
tell</B>
<P><B>our teacher.   As I stared I realised that they were all dressed in
long</B>
<P><B>white flowing robes, and glided rather than wlaked.   I couldn't
avert</B>
<P><B>my eyes and they simultaneously turned their heads towards me as if
they</B>
<P><B>had trouble turning their necks, when thier faces finally met mine
the</B>
<P><B>dark deep pits that filled the space where their eyes once were</B>
<P><B>ddrowned  my senses, their faces were  pale as the snow and then they</B>
<P><B>faded away before my eyes.   I never said anything to my friends who</B>
<P><B>were talking about the new guy at school.</B>

</H3><P><B>By:  bhawkins@unionky.edu</B>
<P>
<P><B>This happened some couple of years ago at my home in southern</B>
<P><B>Kentucky.  I was 16 at the time at up late working on some homework</B>
<P><B>after my mother and father had already gone to bed.  Well, something
or</B>
<P><B>"someone" told me to look up just as I began really to study then out
of</B>
<P><B>the corner of my eye and then my full vision, as I turned around, I
saw</B>
<P><B>a man dressed in Union Blue standing in my living room.  What a
shocker!</B>
<P><B>Scared to death I jumped up and raced to confront this, then thought,</B>
<P><B>theif.  However, when I was in arms length he avnished never to</B>
<P><B>reappear.</B>
<P>
<P><B>This isn't my only experience though. Just a few weeks ago i had the</B>
<P><B>feeling not to open the attic door, but when I did something in old</B>
<P><B>fashioned white puffy sleeves came charging at me and knocked me down.
</B>
<P><B>I have prove of this encounter but none of the other.</B>
