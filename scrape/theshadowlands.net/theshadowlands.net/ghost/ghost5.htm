<B>A few years ago I worked in the county museum which was housed in one
of our
town's founding father's old homes.  It is a beautiful Gothic Revival style




mansion and has been immaculately kept.  I was in charge of security and
m
maintenance, and I was the first on the list to be called if the audio alarm
ever went off.  On Christmas morning of 1988, the security company called
me
around 7:00 a.m. and told me they heard children's voices and a dog barking.
I went to the house to investigate and found absolutely nothing.  The house,
like our entire small city, were quiet on Christmas morning.  

A former employee of the museum--a total skeptic--onces admitted to seeing

a lady in a long, white Victorian gown walking down the upstairs hall.
Others 
had seen her as well over the many years the house had been open to the
public.

When I was attending classes at the local university, I would often go there
at night to type my papers, and frequently I heard creaking floorboards,
closing 
doors, and distant voices.  Usually, I ran out of the building as quick as

I could!

The house itself is gorgeous--beautiful gardens, ornate rooms...but there
is
definetly a "feel" to the place.  My only direct encounter was when I went
to
use the basement lavatory one day and found myself "locked" in by a giggling




child.  I went to open the door and found it forced shut by "someone", and
I
heard a yong child laughing on the other side of the door.

Often, the house smelled inexplicably like roses.  Other than these
incidences,
I'm not aware of many other occurences.  Nothing was ever threatening about
the place...only odd.</B>

	Ever since I was a little girl I have had and made connections 
with the unexplained.  I wonder if our DNA carries this to our 
children, for my son and daughter also have their own stories to tell. Like
our our heritage, a continuing connection with our relatives and 
their past, spirits, and events that have a connection with them, that we
many know nothing about other than the fact that something strange 
happens to us, something that we cannot explain or understand? 
	I am second generation American, my grandparents on my mother's side 
were Russian immigrants from the Carpathian mountain range in 
Europe, home of Dracula.  My father's side came from Budapest, and it was
told to me that his family was of Hungarian gypsi descent.  Many 
strange stories were told to me by my father during the course of his life,
but I am going to tell you about my own experiences, and my 
children's. 
	I have lived in many different cities, and things just seem to follow 
me, I think, or does our spirit possibly hold connections that 
lead us to certain places without conscious choice, I have yet to figure
it
out.  My most recent eventful story is in Las Vegas where I now 
live.  I bought a house that is about 35 years old (that's old by las vegas




standards).  When I went house hunting I found this house and 
without even going in it I told the realtor that this is the house I wanted.
It was out of my price range, not expensive but I had a modest 
income and was a single parent with two children.  I wanted the house so
bad,
I didnt even have the money in the bank to cover the earnest 
money deposit and during escrow I hoped that it wouldnt be found out.  I
prayed every night that I could have this house, I dont know why but 
something drove me to it.  
	One night I was lying in my bed, on my stomach, and I heard a very 
soft whisper in my ear, directly behind my head.  A man's voice 
said to me in a comforting way "you shall have your house".  The very next




morning, I got the call from the realtor, the loan was approved.  
We moved into the house, then things started to happen.  The first day the
air conditioning went out, the second day the refrigator went out. 
 I had the repairs made, but one thing that I could never fix was the master




bedroom's constant coldness, sometimes too cold to even sleep in. 
 Every heating and air conditioning company that I called in to check it
out
said there was no mechanical problems with the unit or the vents, 
and strangely whenever someone came out to check it, the room's temperature
was normal.  So I learned to live with it, then one day I was 
yelling at my kids while I was walking towards my bedroom, and just before
I
entered my room, and as I stood in the threshold my voice 
resonated as if I were in a great hall.  I took a few steps back and it
sounded normal, I walked in my room and it sounded normal.  Only in 
that one small spot did my voice resonate like that.  
	Strange events started to happen in the next few days, every night 
around midnight.  Just after I had fallen asleep, my dogs began 
barking as if to alert me of a stranger.  My dogs slept with me in my bedroom
on my bed.   I started to get upset after the first few times of 
checking it out and found nothing.  My kids were fast asleep, so what could
it be?  One night I decided to stay awake and catch whatever 
caused this disruption, I just lied in my bed with the lights off as usual,




pretending to be going to sleep, looked at the clock and it was 
just before midnight, and just like clockwork Roxy, one of my dogs who was
lying at the foot of my bed, jumped up and started barking which 
staring towards the doorway.  I threw off the covers, sat up, and looked
towards the doorway of my bedroom, and to my astonishment I saw only 
two large almond shaped yellow-green glowing eyes staring right at me!  It




happend all so fast, I must have startled whatever it was, because 
it lasted only seconds and the eyes seemed to have backed up so rapidly as
to
whoosh away like a shooting star or comet falling from the sky 
with a trail of light.  I turned on the light and got out of bed and quickly




checked the kids to see if they were ok.  They were fast asleep 
and heard nothing and knew nothing when I talked to them the next morning.
But my daughter did say that a few nights previous to this 
incident that she had walked past her brother's bedroom and saw him
vertically suspended upside-down on his head, out of his bed, still in his




sleeping position with his blanket and pillow in the air. She never told
me
about this because she thought I would never believe it.  Well 
that next morining also brought about the change of the sound in the
threshould of the doorway to my bedroom, I stood in the same spot as 
before, spoke alould, and the resonating sound my voice made was gone.  
	Both my children have seen unexplained apparitions, at another house
we lived in.  This one was in Portland, Oregon.  It was a new 
house build on unholy ground.  Objects were moved and found in places where
they didn't belong, lights were found on when they were on when we 
had turned them off, but the most disturbing was a faceless lady covered
in a
hooded dark cloak that appeared to my son that made him cry in 
the night.  He saw her standing in his sliding closet doorway in his bedroom.
The next night my daughter not knowing what her brother had 
seen, saw the very same thing in her bedroom closet doorway, both of their




closets shared the same wall and were back to back.
	My stories are many and so are my experiences, maybe some other time 
I can tell you more.  I swear that all I have said is the truth.</B>

</H3><P><B>by boxak@hg.uleth.ca</B>
<P><B>
I have always been a believer in the supernatural, but I never saw
anything until I started working at a restaurant in my hometown.
It was a long-standing rumour that this restaurant has been
haunted.  It was a large, old house that had been converted into an
eating establishment.  Anyways, when I worked there, I always worked 
the later shifts. These would usually last until 1:00 a.m. and I worked 
the upstairs setting up tables and doing clean-up.  But I always felt 
uneasy at work, especially when I would pass by the stairs to the third 
floor. Whenever my back was turned towards the stairs, I would get this 
feeling that someone was watching me.  This continued for sometime.
Then, after a few months, I would see movement in the corners of my
eyes and it would always come from the top of those stairs.
The thing that really scared me was what happened late one night
when two other coworkers were upstairs with me.  We had a really busy
night and it was especially late when we were setting up tables.
We had just finished setting the tables and we were talking when we 
heard the sounds of movement.  All three of us look towards a table in
the corner just in time to see a chair move up to the table by itself!
One of the coworkers, who had been there for 6 years, calmly laughed
and said it was the ghost.  When we talked to him later, he said that
he had seen lots of things like that, and when I talked to other
coworkers, they said they got the same feeling I did, and saw 
movement at the top of the stairs as well.
Maybe we are all just imagining things, I don't know.  This is what
I saw and experienced and I believe it.  Judge for yourself.

<P><B>My sister moved to kansas about one month ago. When i was at her house
i

got bored so she decided to tell me a story about a recent experance she

had had when she was working on a shipwrecked ship (after the ship was 
wrecked the made it into a restaurnt). The first day on the job she 
needed to find the office but she couldn't (she had never been on the 
ship before)She ran into a yound man with bright ornge hair, and very 
pail looking. She asked him where the office was and he gave her a key 
and pointed to a door. When she went over to the door and opened it she 
was overwhelmed with fear but she kept on going. The room she was in was

an old pool room. when she got to the other side of the room she opened 
the door and the captin just stared at her for a while Then he said "How

the heck did you get in here?" she replied "someone gave me a key 
and told me to go through that door." he replied "ma'am that door has 
been locked for Years no one has the key but me" She said "but that 
can't be true one of your saliors let me in!" he said "what did he 
look like?" She said "ornge hair slender pail looking and i think he 
said his name was browns." he said "ma'am no one on this ship fits that




description, The room has been closed beacouse people died there and it 
is said to be haunted." I never really knew if i belived her but to this

day she swears it is true.

</H3><P><B>by cpeifer@headcrash.lanl.gov</B>
<P>
<P><B>I live in one of the many forests in New Mexico, and many of the homes

</B>
<P><B>are built either on or near ancient indian ruins;  many date back to
the </B>
<P><B>1100's.  I have been told by many people of the area that these are
</B>
<P><B>sacred mountains.</B>
<P>
<P><B>One September late afternoon, I was standing at my kitchen sink doing

</B>
<P><B>dishes.  The kitchen windows look into a solarium where the houseplants

</B>
<P><B>live.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>This particular day, while doing dishes, I look up and into the windows,

</B>
<P><B>and there on the other side of the window is the manifestation of a
young </B>
<P><B>man of about 30 years old.  What was so strange was that it was like
I </B>
<P><B>couldn't move or look away...and it appeared as though he didn't even
see </B>
<P><B>me.  It was more like he was looking through or past me.  The thoughts
I </B>
<P><B>was receiving was that this man was recently deceased, and had died
</B>
<P><B>tragically, and before what he thought was his time.  He looked so
scared </B>
<P><B>and confused.  He was wearing blue jeans, a white shirt not buttoned
all </B>
<P><B>the way up, and white socks with no shoes.</B>
<P>
<P><B>And then he was gone;  just faded quickly and that was that.  When
I </B>
<P><B>looked in the solarium, the first thing that struck me was that for
</B>
<P><B>anyone to stand in front of the windows on that side, they would have
to </B>
<P><B>be at least four feet off the ground!</B>
<P>
<P><B>Before this person's appearance, my family and I had seen shadows moving

</B>
<P><B>through the house, or had just caught glimpses of people.  This was
the </B>
<P><B>first time someone had actually manifested themselves.</B>
<P>
<P><B>We were told by a spiritual healer friend, that our house had a vortex

</B>
<P><B>running through it... a doorway for the spirits to pass into, and that

</B>
<P><B>some of them missed the mark.</B>
<P>
<P><B>There are still a few passersby, and in different parts of the house.

 </B>
<P><B>They seem totally unaware of us, and we have had to help a couple of
them </B>
<P><B>move on.  You get used to the traffic after a while.</B>

<H3><A NAME="cat ghosts">Cat Ghosts</A>
</H3><P><B>by marshallnet.com@ns.marshallnet.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>My mother had two cats, one named carmel, (like the candy) and another

named</B>
<P><B>nubee. (thats how we spelled it, but its actually cloud in french or</B>
<P><B>something) Carmel died long before nubee did, while we were on vacation

I</B>
<P><B>believe. It was so long ago, I don't recall exactly. Then there was

nubee.</B>
<P><B>Pronounced NEW BEE, she lived to be 20 human years, although i'm not

sure</B>
<P><B>what that is in cat years, she had to be put to sleep. I always loved

nubee</B>
<P><B>because she was so old she just loved to curl up next to you while

watching</B>
<P><B>T.V. or taking a nap. She was the kindest gentlest cat I ever knew.
Never bit</B>
<P><B>or scratched.</B>
<P><B>	After she died, I really didn't think of her much, just because I
never get</B>
<P><B>really attached to animals. Then one night while sleeping downstairs

(where</B>
<P><B>my room had just been moved to) I heard the familiar cry of a cat.
A very</B>
<P><B>unusual sound to those whom have heard it, not a whining or whimpering
but a</B>
<P><B>very sort of scary odd sounding cry that is very hard to describe.
I don't</B>
<P><B>know that all cats make the sound, never the less I heard it. Just
like nubee</B>
<P><B>would do late late at night. When I had friends stay the night they

would</B>
<P><B>often shake me awake at night and ask me, "What in the world is that

sound?"</B>
<P><B>It would frighten most people. Now that I think of it I think there
is a name</B>
<P><B>for what they do but I just can't remember.</B>
<P><B>	After hearing the cry I pulled my head up to a ceiling high window,

which</B>
<P><B>was just a foot off the ground level, so your eyes would just pan the

area</B>
<P><B>just at ground level, which would make it easy to see any animals around.

No</B>
<P><B>cats, no anything outside. I admit I was a little scared, so I didn't

go</B>
<P><B>outside. But then it happed again, not more than a few days later.
I had to</B>
<P><B>determine whether or not it was a cat outside or not, but it sounded

so</B>
<P><B>close, not like sound through a window, but inside, like sound through

a</B>
<P><B>hollow object. I slowly crept upstairs and looked around outside, but
I saw</B>
<P><B>absolutly nothing. I didn't just peek around, I had a flashlight and
I combed</B>
<P><B>my yard (under the decks and all) even around my neighbors yards. Nothing

not</B>
<P><B>a thing. </B>
<P><B>	I am a believer in ghosts, but I never thought cats. Then I

remembered,</B>
<P><B>nubee was cremated, and her ash was in a tin box in our living room,

directly</B>
<P><B>above my room in the basement.</B>

<H3><A NAME="a few">A Few Ghostly Encounters</A>
</H3><P><B>by T.Hurrell@kingston.ac.uk</B>
<P>
<P><B>Hi</B>
<P><B>I've always had an open mind  about ghosts etc. but had had no real
</B>
<P><B>experience of them, apart from a seeing a figure dressed in </B>
<P><B>seventeenth century farm clothing in wide open Sussex countryside,
</B>
<P><B>until a couple of years ago. I was in digs, sharing a house with a
</B>
<P><B>colleague who was, and is, a good friend; she divorced her husband
</B>
<P><B>and, after he moved out, I moved in on a strictly business nature as
</B>
<P><B>part of the deal was that I baby sat for her son whilst she built up
</B>
<P><B>some kind of social life again. It was a good deal as I had been </B>
<P><B>going through an awkward patch myself, and I had two rooms at the </B>
<P><B>back of the house for my use. The husband died about three months </B>
<P><B>after I moved in and, though it was obviously a troubled time there
</B>
<P><B>was no hint of anything amiss until about a year later.</B>
<P><B>I' d been out that evening and after returning sat up watching late
</B>
<P><B>night TV - always an imsomniac, this sometimes forces me to bed - </B>
<P><B>and eventually turned in some time after 0200; I didn't sleep at all
</B>
<P><B>well, getting more and more nervous as the night grew old. I was also

</B>
<P><B>very cold and, my landlady had an awesome use of central heating, </B>
<P><B>starting to shiver. Finally I was so cold I couldn't move but it </B>
<P><B>wasn't just that...I was scared rigid - I've led a varied life, had
a few </B>
<P><B>close scrapes but I've never had the terrors like this; the sensation
in </B>
<P><B>the room was one of pure hatred. Whatever it was seemed to be in the
</B>
<P><B>corner of the room between the window and a built-in wardobe, there
</B>
<P><B>was nothing to see but plenty to sense; the room itself became much
</B>
<P><B>colder and with it the sense of loathing and malevolence grew more
</B>
<P><B>intense. It wanted me out of there and wasn't worried about how. </B>
<P><B>I was so scared I couldn't even shout out, in fact I was finding it
very </B>
<P><B>hard to breathe under the weight of this malignity. </B>
<P><B>After a while - I've no notion of a timescale for this - the </B>
<P><B>atmosphere began to lighten and eventually faded away completely; the

</B>
<P><B>room warmed up and so eventually did I - not that I stayed in there
</B>
<P><B>for the rest of that night. </B>
<P><B>A couple of months later, my landlady happily back in the </B>
<P><B>swing of things, she wanted the room back. I didn't argue the toss.
</B>
<P><B>Neither did I tell her what occurred that night; I had my thoughts
on </B>
<P><B>the matter but they were best left unsaid.</B>
<P><B>On a happier note, I now live a pleasant little cul-de-sac by the </B>
<P><B>River Thames, being well-lit I've no qualms about walking down the
</B>
<P><B>centre of the road. Which I was doing the other evening on a breezy
</B>
<P><B>summer night when I walked into the scent of a cigar; it was such </B>
<P><B>a nice smell that I stopped and breathed in deeply before walking on.

</B>
<P><B>You know you sometimes get a feeling of `weirdness'; I'd gone on  
</B>
<P><B>another 20 foot or so before it dawned that the smell hadn't </B>
<P><B>dissipated in the wind whilst I inhaled it so I walked back to where
</B>
<P><B>I originally stopped. The smell of cigar, good quality cigar, was </B>
<P><B>still there just in this one spot, I walked through it, around it and

</B>
<P><B>stood in it. It had a boundary, a couple of steps in any direction
</B>
<P><B>and no smell; I searched the ground for butts, manhole covers, no-one

</B>
<P><B>was up, no house lights were on and, if I moved away, no smell. </B>
<P><B>Puzzled I walked a long way off and then came back - still there.</B>
<P><B>Not there in the morning though as I went to work. The funny thing
</B>
<P><B>is it was such a friendly, homely smell I couldn't help but smile </B>
<P><B>when breathing it in (yes, I know what it sounds like!)...no terrors
</B>
<P><B>with this at all!</B>
<P>
<P><B>Hope you find these interesting, they've certainly enlivened some </B>
<P><B>evenings for me </B>
