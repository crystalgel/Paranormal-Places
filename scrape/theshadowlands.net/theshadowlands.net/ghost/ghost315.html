<p><b>Saratoga Battlefields</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: kittenface@gmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I live not even a minute from Battlefields, they surround me pretty</b>
<br><b>much. The woods near the Battlefield, are very haunted as well.
The</b>
<br><b>Whistling Soldier wanders throughout those woods. My father has</b>
<br><b>encountered him a couple times during deer hunting season. Once
he</b>
<br><b>felt the soldier breathe on his face and another time he thought
he</b>
<br><b>heard his friend right behind him, turned around and no one was
to be</b>
<br><b>found, he is pretty sure it was the Whistling Soldier because he
heard</b>
<br><b>whistling, but nobody was present. My brother and his friend went
into</b>
<br><b>the woods when they were young. They found raw pig heads hanging
from</b>
<br><b>the same tree where my father went to and felt the soldier breathe
on</b>
<br><b>his face. Up the road, where battlefields are located there's a
fork/y</b>
<br><b>in the road. Cops have said that they have seen sightings of soldier</b>
<br><b>ghosts at night and scenes of the battle going on. When you drive</b>
<br><b>through the entire battlefield area, there is nothing but fog at
night</b>
<br><b>no matter how the weather is or what time of the year. Only in that</b>
<br><b>area though. It is awesome I think. I hear booms and bangs at night</b>
<br><b>outside my window, all the time.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Scary Place</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: shmac7@ptd.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>I am so excited to find this site.&nbsp; I couldn't find anyone who
remembers this place and how scary it was.</b>
<br><b>West Milford, NJ............Clinton Road</b>
<br><b>This used to be a great party and date road in the 70's.</b>
<br><b>I heard that a couple ran out of gas on the road at night, not knowing
the Clinton Road stories, he left his girlfriend in the locked car while
he walked to a gas station.</b>
<br><b>She fell asleep and woke up hearing a noise on the top of the car:&nbsp;&nbsp;
ding......ding.....ding.....</b>
<br><b>When she got out of the car her boyfriend had been killed and hung
above the car and the noise was his blood dripping.</b>
<br><b>The legend was that there were yiddies in the woods.&nbsp; The were
half man and half animal.&nbsp; They hid behind trees and were virtually
invisible in the woods.&nbsp; They waited for you to get out of the car
to "get you".</b>
<br><b>I remember a date taking me there.&nbsp; We talked about the stories
on our way.&nbsp; When we got on Clinton Road, he parked and went to get
out of the car.&nbsp; I could've sworn that I could here and see movement
in the woods.&nbsp; I screamed until he got back in and made him keep the
car moving.</b>
<br><b>I never made it to the castle, out of fear!!!</b>
<br><b>Everytime I was on that road (always at night), I never saw another
car coming the other way or behind us.</b><b></b>

<br><b>My Experiences</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: yurikimkorea@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hi there. My name is yuri and I'm korean.</b>
<br><b>I like ghost stories so I enjoy this site.</b>
<br><b>I had two experiences about ghost or something ( I believe it was
ghost ).</b>
<br><b>I'm not good at english but please understand me.</b>
<br><b>I have been living this house since I was 15. now I'm 21. I don't
think my</b>
<br><b>house is haunted until now.</b>
<br><b>One day I stayed at home without my family, it was night. I tried
to sleep</b>
<br><b>in my bed. I like sleeping but that night, I couldn't sleep easily.
I</b>
<br><b>didn't know why. anyway, I closed my eyes to sleep. when I was thinking</b>
<br><b>about something, I heard something " why don't you sleep? " near
my ears !</b>
<br><b>It was woman's voice so I thought my mom called me, but there was
just me</b>
<br><b>alone in my house. I couldn't sleep.</b>
<br><b>and after that day, two month ago from now, something happened to
me again.</b>
<br><b>It was summer night. my mom and dad was sleeping in their room.
I sat down</b>
<br><b>in sofa and watched TV in living room. suddenly I felt cold ( it
was</b>
<br><b>summer! ) so I back to my room and went to sleep. at midnight, I
awoke with</b>
<br><b>a start, then in my room, I saw somewon's passing by my bed. It
was black</b>
<br><b>thing but seemed like ppl.</b>
<br><b>I thought that thing tried to go to veranda.</b>
<br><b>( veranda's door is in my room so if somewon want to go to veranda,
must</b>
<br><b>pass my room )</b>
<br><b>Then, suddenly, the thing stopped, turned back and came to my bed.
then it</b>
<br><b>said to me " close your eyes and go back to sleep.." It was my mom's
voice.</b>
<br><b>I thought it must be my mom. so I closed my eyes. then the black
thing</b>
<br><b>muttered something to itself near my ears. It was like&nbsp; magic
words or</b>
<br><b>something like that. I couldn't understand. so, I opened my eyes
and said "</b>
<br><b>mom, what are you doing? what did you say? " then the thing said
" close</b>
<br><b>your eyes and go back to sleep.."</b>
<br><b>so I did close my eyes. then I heard muttering again. I felt it
wasn't my</b>
<br><b>mom ! why mom was in my room and something to do at midnight !&nbsp;
so, I was</b>
<br><b>frighted and opened my eyes again, then the thing was disappeared.
It was</b>
<br><b>ghost !!</b>
<br><b>I don't know what it was...all I remember now is the thing was tried
to act</b>
<br><b>my mom. what was the muttering thing means? I don't know...</b><b></b>

<p><b>When I lived in a small house in Surrey, B.C,</b>
<br><b>There in the upstairs bedroom lived evil spirits which use to come
at all times of the day &amp; night, Banging on the walls , slamming doors
and turning on hairdryers up in the bedroom. Also this ghost or evil spirit
attacked me while I was reading in bed one night. very glad to have moved
out of that house. I have since experienced others but never to the extent

<p><b>House of Shootfelt street.</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: vayansinmiedo@hvc.rr.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I used to live in a house with my mother, and it was very old, made
in the early 1900’s, during ww1.It was a two story house, but very small.
There was only one bathroom, and that was upstairs. My bedroom was upstairs
also. Well, I always hated going upstairs, ever since I lived there. You
always felt like you where being watched and always wanted to look behind
you. I always kept my door closed when I was sleeping, I had no Idea why,
but my instincts told me to. My parents both told me leave your door open
one night, so I did. That night, something woke me up. I had no idea what,
and it was really, really, cold. I looked at the door, and I saw a shadow
there, a shape of a person, tall. I turned around in my bed, paralyzed
with fear, and forced myself to go to sleep.&nbsp; Nothing else happened,
except the being watched part. Sometimes my mother would go to the gas
station and pick up some things. I hated that, I felt like there was a
presence with me. I tried to ignore it by watching T.V, but it was no use.
So instead I went outside and played there. Time rolled on, and by the
time I was eight, My parents got a divorce. My mom met another man, and
we where going to move in with him. And by the way, my mom never felt these
“presences” .&nbsp; My mom was cleaning out the attic, taking out all of
the junk. It was always really, really, hot up there. She said it was cold,
and felt a very uncomfortable presence.&nbsp; She said it felt like someone
was behind her, and he/she was very mad. She ran out of the house and swore
she would never go back in. She left all the stuff in the attic, and never
stepped in again. We moved out of the house, and never returned. I believe
that those so many years we lived there, the spirits never wanted us to
leave, and so they got angry. There are also many other haunted houses
on that street.&nbsp; We sold it to another family, and they will experience
the hauntings of the house on Shootfelt Street.</b>

<p><b>Haunted Places Checked Out</b><b></b>
<p><b>By&nbsp; TTCM@IUP.EDU</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am writing to you to tell
you about some personal experiences</b>
<br><b>I had at a few of the sites listed on your website. First one is</b>
<br><b>Damian's Grave located in Moon Twp. Pa. My boyfriend and I found
the</b>
<br><b>listing for the haunted grave about four months ago, and went to
the</b>
<br><b>site about two weeks ago. Whenever we returned home from visiting
the</b>
<br><b>site, we checked your website, and noticed that the listing for
the</b>
<br><b>haunted grave was gone. We were just curious as to why you took
it off</b>
<br><b>the website? We took pictures of Damian's Grave at night with my</b>
<br><b>Digital Camera. After view the picture, we saw little floating circles</b>
<br><b>about the grave or as you would call them "orbs." Next and our most</b>
<br><b>recent experience is "Beyond the Creek" located in Pitcairn Pa.
We</b>
<br><b>walked back the trail a good mile if not more and did not run into
any</b>
<br><b>type of bridge or drop off point that would indeed be labeled a
cliff.</b>
<br><b>So, we believe that the source of Information on that listing is</b>
<br><b>false.</b>

<br><b>Ghost in my House</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: living_dead_girl6788@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hello, my name is Kaila, I am 14 years old and live in New Castle,
Pa. My first exprience was when I was about 9 or 10. I lived in a home
in New Wilmington Pa, and I loved it very much. After about 2 weeks of
living there, a neighbor was mowing her lawn and stopped my mother and
I to say "Welcome to the neighbor hood". My mother invited her over for
something to eat. I was sitting in the living room when I over heard the
neighbor telling my parents a story about the house. Appeantly, a man had
built the house for him and his new bride, but a few days after they moved
in she disappeared and was never found...I payed no attention. A few months
later my room was being painted so I had to sleep on a couch in the basement,
which I had no problem. But, as I was sleeping, I saw a black figure standing
over me...I couldn't make out a face, I didnt have time...I screamed and
the figure vanished, my mother came downstairs, I told her what i had seen...she
told me I was full of it and I was just seeing things. A few nights ater
I woke up because I had heard somthing. I walked around trying to see where
the sound was coming from, it sounded like banging. I walked by a closet,
and heard it louder, I opened the doors, but saw nothing, so I closed them...then
heard what i beileve was a young womens voice wimpering "help me", fightened,
i ran under my covers and tried to ingore it. About a week later, Cable
man were there to hook up the tv downstairs. I walked downstairs to get
somthing and watched. They had to break through the back of the closet
(for some reason) but when they did, instead of brick or somthing, there
was another room...but they just left it alone. I begged my mother time
and time again to break through the walls of the small room, because I
heard bagging. Again, she told me I was crazy and now hearing things. A
year later we moved, but time and time again I saw that figure and heard
the womens voice. After we moved into a new home, I studied ghosts and
sightings, I became obbessed with the paranormal. When I am older, I want
to become a P.I. I want to talk with them, figure out how to set them free
from where ever they still roam...or if they even want to be set free.
Thank you very much for reading my story, if you have any questions, please
feel free to email me.</b>

<p><b>Capital high school</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: jm.young@adelphia.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>I attended Capital for three years and I can attest to the validity
of this</b>
<br><b>haunting.</b>
<br><b>I was in the band my sophomore and freshman years, the practice
rooms and</b>
<br><b>the main class room for the band sits beside the theater.&nbsp;
I often felt I</b>
<br><b>was being watched while in the practice rooms.&nbsp; I mainly practiced
after</b>
<br><b>school and not many people remained in the facility.&nbsp; A friend,
who was</b>
<br><b>involved in the theater/drama classes at capital would often catch
a ride</b>
<br><b>home with me when I finished practice.&nbsp; He told me several
times he thought</b>
<br><b>he heard me walking across the stage to see if he was ready to go,
but it</b>
<br><b>was never my foot steps he heard. The other section of the school
I know is</b>
<br><b>haunted is the "400 wing" we called it B.F.E. or Egypt because of
the long</b>
<br><b>walk from the courtyard.&nbsp; I had a computer class there in which
I would go</b>
<br><b>to other rooms to trouble shoot the network (the entire school is

<p><b>Uncle Jacob</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Jessieclari@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Here is my story. My brother Jacob died in an automobile accident
when he was 16 years old. We were extremely close, and I believe he visited
me after he died. At the time of his death my brother was living with my
parents about 14 miles away from my husband and I. My brother used to spend
a lot of time at our house, like I said we were very close. A couple of
months after he died was when strange things started to happen. The first
occurrence happened one night after I had just put my son to bed. At the
time my son was a little over a year old. My husband and I were in the
living room talking about my brother, and how we missed him. All of the
sudden every electronic toy in my son's playpen, which was in the same
room,&nbsp; started going off at once, and the lights in the living room
started flickering. It went on for about 10 seconds and then stopped all
at once. The next occurrence happened a few weeks later. Again, my brother
was the topic of conversation that night. My husband and I were sitting
on the couch in the living room, from there we could see directly down
our hallway. As we were talking all of the sudden we heard someone stomping
down the hallway towards us. We both looked at each other with huge eyes
and then both of us looked down the hall. Nothing was there. After that
little things would happen, like objects being moved, or light footsteps,
the opening and shutting of doors on their own and the feeling that I was
being watched. Then one day I was dressing my son in his room after a bath.
He was about 2 years old at the time. My son was 11 months old when my
brother died, so of course he would not remember him. I have told my son
about my brother though and he can recognize him in a picture. Well, my
son's bedroom was at the end of the hall and if you were to stand in the
middle of the room you could see directly down the hallway. My son was
standing in the middle of the room as I was dressing him. I was sitting
on the floor facing my son with my back to the doorway. All of the sudden
the hair on the back of my neck stood up and my son was pointing down the
hall, shouting "look, Uncle Jacob, Uncle Jacob! Look Mom, he's right there!".
I could feel his presence and it scared me. Now you may ask, why be scared
of your own brother? I can't explain it. I just picked up my son and left.
After that day, nothing out of the ordinary happened. We lived in there
for 2 more years and then moved. I can't explain why most of this was centered
around the hallway though, maybe someone a little more knowledgeable could
explain it to me.</b>

<p><b>Wolfinger Cemetery</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: RUaGhst2@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>Central Ave.</b>
<br><b>Toledo, Ohio</b>
<br><b>Wolfinger Cemetery actually sits in the middle of Secor Park. Once
in the park I found the side road that leads to the Cemetery. You are welcomed
in by a huge arched rod iron gate. It is a very old Cemetery with Tombstones
that date back to the late 1700s. It is a fairly small Cemetery. I was
driving through looking for the five graves sites of the Family that had
died within weeks of each other. It didn't take long to find them. They
are buried along the fence to the far right side of the Cemetery. I got
out of the car to read the names on the Tombstones (My wife wouldn't leave
the car ). They are the Ford Family. The Fathers name was Wallace and the
Mother Elizabeth. The Children's tombstones read Wallace, Eliza &amp; Infant.
They all passed away in the late 1800s. I couldn't read the Tombstones
because they are weather'd fairly bad but made out the names. I didn't
see anything Paranormal but felt an energy of some sort while standing
over the graves wondering what the true story of this Family might be.
I just had this strange feeling that they knew I was there looking for
them. I began to have a stronger feeling that they were waiting for me.
I said a short prayer for them and asked if any of them wanted to communicate
with me. Well, that's when I really got chills and felt as though Eliza
was with me. I tried to communicate with her but didn't seem to get a visible
response. After a few moments I went back to the car where my Wife was
waiting. She said she didn't like the Cemetery and wouldn't want to be
buried there herself. She was ready to leave. While starting the car and
we began to drive away, I felt as though Eliza didn't want me to leave.
I just felt her strong presence even in the car. Well, that's when she
made her presence known. My headlights began to turn on and off by themselves.
My wife asked me how in the world was I doing that with the lights? I stopped
the car and took my hands off the steering wheel as my wife and I watched
in amazement as the headlights and dashlights continued to turn on and
off more then a dozen times. I then backed the car up to the Ford Family
graves and thanked Eliza for the communication and told her that she couldn't
attach herself to me and that she had to stay with her family. I also told
her I would be back to visit again. My wife and I then drove out of the
Cemetery and drove about a mile down the road when all of a sudden the
car began it's light show again. Headlights and Dashlights turning on and
off repeatedly. I stopped the car in the middle of the road and we watched
again in amazement as the emergency flashers began to blink as well. I
told my wife that Eliza must still be with us. My wife then said we had
to go back to the Cemetery. Funny coming from the same person that couldn't
wait to get out of the Cemetery in the first place. I turned the car around
lights going off and on all the way back to the Cemetery. I stopped at
the Family graves again and then asked Eliza this time to stay with her
Family. By this time the Lights had stopped performing there Paranormal
light show. I drove away and back home without another single incident
with the headlights. It's been several days now and I haven't had an electrical
problem at all with the vehicle what's so ever. Although my wife and I
never saw Eliza in a human form, If you stop by her graveside you'll definitely
know she's there.</b>
<br><b>PS My wife isn't used to witnessing this type of Paranormal activity.
It made it all the more exciting for me that she witnessed it all first
hand. I think we found another believer. Below is an article I found on
your web site that got my interest in this story</b>
<br><b>Wolfinger Cemetery - Toledo, Ohio</b>
<br><b>Toledo's Wolfinger Cemetery contains graves which date back to the
1800's. Along the wooded edge of the cemetery there are the graves of two
parents and their three children, all of whom died withing days of each
other. The children have been seen playing around the graves, particularly
a girl of about ten or twelve.</b>

<br><b>Growing Up</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: anonymous</b><b></b>
<p><b>I don't have questions or concerns ... I was just browsing the subject
of "ghosts" and stumbled on to your website and it reminded me of some
"things" I had encountered growing up.</b>
<br><b>For years I have felt that my parents home in downstate Michigan
was haunted.&nbsp; No one would believe me when I would tell them the things
that happened to me so I quit telling people.&nbsp; My parents never believed
me either until one night they heard something that couldn't be explained.&nbsp;
They were laying in bed when they heard a crash that was extremely loud;
Dad said it sounded like a huge dresser had toppled over.&nbsp; Because
he's paranoid about security (and because the alarm was on but was not
going off), he got up to investigate.&nbsp; He searched the entire house
including the garage, attic and basement and did not find anything out
of place.&nbsp; Now, I should add that my parents were in their early 70's
when this happened and my Dad doesn't make up stories plus they were the
only two living in the house.&nbsp; He finally told me that he more or
less believed the things that I had said happened, did indeed happen.</b>
<br><b>The most frightening thing as when I was about 17 or 18 and was
home alone.&nbsp; I had met my parents on their way out of the house when
I came home and knew I was the only one home (I was the last of my parent's
children living home at that time).&nbsp; It was summer and mid-day so
the doors and windows were opened, but locked (again, Dad's paranoid about
security).&nbsp; As I stood in the kitchen at the counter separating it
from the dining room, I heard footsteps POUNDING up the basement stairs
which open into the dining room.&nbsp; Knowing that I was alone, I waited
to see who came up.&nbsp; When no one did, I got a funny feeling and just
stood there.&nbsp; Seconds later, more POUNDING - DEFINITELY footsteps.&nbsp;
Again, I waited - no one entered the room (you cannot come up the basement
stairs without coming directly into the dining room and being seen plus
the footsteps sounded like whoever was coming up the stairs came running
full force up them ALL THE WAY to the top of the stairs).&nbsp; I decided
to be brave and go see who was on the stairs - plus I just had to know.&nbsp;
I walked over and looked through the open door - footsteps had sounded
only seconds before, but there was no one there!&nbsp; I decided that I
would mow the lawn and quickly left the house.&nbsp; I told my parents
about it when they got home, but they didn't believe me.</b>
<br><b>Another night, I was again alone in the house and standing with
my back to dining room slightly bending over the counter reading the newspaper.&nbsp;
Since I was alone and no radios or T.V.'s were on, it was quiet in the
house.&nbsp; Then I heard a slight "swishing" sound.&nbsp; Not immediately
understanding where it was coming from, I looked up and saw my mom's spoon
rest gently swaying on the wall.&nbsp; It continued swaying until I grabbed
the phone to call my sister-in-law because I was scared.&nbsp; As soon
as Janet answered, it quit.&nbsp; I told her what had happened and she
laughed.&nbsp; We spoke for about ten minutes then I hung up.&nbsp; As
soon as I started to read the paper, the spoon rest started swaying again!&nbsp;
I quickly got Janet back on the phone and refused to let her go for 45
minutes until my parents came home.&nbsp; I told them what had happened
and it scared me so much, that that was the last time I was alone in their
house - I refuse to go there without someone else being there.&nbsp; I'm
now 43 and I still won't go into the house alone.</b>
<br><b>Many other things happened to me as I was growing up.&nbsp; It was
nothing for me to put my brush down on my dresser, turn my back, and it
would be gone when I turned around (NOT having moved my feet, just turned).&nbsp;
Then the brush would "fall" out of the air and drop onto my dresser.&nbsp;
For a long time this frightened me, but I basically became used to it.&nbsp;
Another time, I remember going to get something from under my bed when
marbles came rolling out from under the bed (almost like someone had thrown
them).&nbsp; I KNEW no one was under the bed because I had just lifted
the bedspread and looked under and there wasn't anything there (plus everyone
was at the dinner table).&nbsp; Since I was quite young at the time (about
six or seven), I ran like a bat out of hell for the dining room.</b>
<br><b>Just writing about these instances makes me uncomfortable, but I
thought I'd share my experiences.&nbsp; I believe in ghosts and actually
had some other experiences away from my parents home, but thankfully, nothing
for at least seven years.&nbsp; I had enough growing up ... I don't want
anything else.</b>
<br><b>Thanks for letting me share this!</b><b></b>

<p><b>A FRIENDLY GHOST?</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: conamak78@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I finally decided to write about the experiances that occured or
are occuring in my home. I am very intrested in ghost and enjoy reading
and learning from the various accounts. I live with my husband and children
in a home we rent from a cousin. Ever since we have moved in I felt that
the house is full of a warm and loving presence. My daughter who is now
2 years old occupies a room were my aunt used to reside, and often over
the baby moniters I hear her talking to someone. My son who is four months,
who is now sharing the room, has been heard babbling as if someone or something
is playing with him. I recently had him baptised and in one of the pictures
where there are no reflections present it appears as if my son is wearing
a halo. After carefully reviewing the picture several times it is the only
way I could describe it. Now for a little history on the house, my aunt
lived there with her parents, her mother passed in 1993, her father died
in January 2002, and my aunt passed in December 2002. I have always believed
that it is my aunt who cares for my family and home because my entire family
became closer to her, especially my mother( they were like best friends).
Recently I had a house guest who has that "6th sense" and jokingly I was
explaining that I thought my aunt was in the house and she said yes I feel
her. After a further discussion she explained she had seen an older women
walking through the hall into the bathroom; and that she got the sense
that she was there to watch over the house.I guess I should explain that
we are not related by blood but we were close friends that grew into family.
If it is her in the home I just wanted to say that I am glad she i there
and she is always thought of. Thank you for listening.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Upstairs at the School</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: k.tindle@mchsi.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Everybody had always said that they heard laughs in the upstairs
part of the old Thomasville School behind the city hall.So last fall I
decided to take a walk and examine the school.I heard something one time,
but I just thought that it was the pigeons that fly in and out of the broken
windows of the old locked up building.the sound continued for the next
few minuets.So I decided to go up the outside fire escape stairs to see
if i could see anything.All I could see was a white figure mixed with green
through the mildewed glass.So I ran home and I called the police because
i thought that some child might have climbed through one of the few broken
windows and&nbsp; be trapped in the locked up building and couldn't get
out.When the police got there they cut the locks and searched the school
for a person but could not find anybody or anything.Until this day I am
still convinced that the upper part of that school is haunted.</b><b></b>

<p><b>THE OLD HOUSE</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: Dutchess_56714@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>My boyfriend and I recently are in the process of moving out to his
grandfathers farm. In which there are two houses. The house, which we are
moving into and than there is the old house. We know that the old house
is over one hundred years old. My boyfriend would be the forth generation
to live on the farm. But moving on.....</b>
<br><b>My boyfriend and I have had three encounters. The first encounter
took place in summer in the afternoon. I had gone into the old house for
the second time to look around. I walked into the kitchen and into the
living room. I senced something but I didn't feel it was a bad spirit.&nbsp;
I heard a womans voice " I am here", " I am here". Suddenly, I got this
bad feeling. Like a voice inside me was telling me to get out of there.
So I, who can only sence them thought it was my boyfriend playing tricks
on me. But when I went outside to tell him nice try. But he was no where
near that old house, I found him comming out of the other house. I didn't
tell him what had happened until the next day.</b>
<br><b>The second encounter was not more than a week or so after the first.
My boyfriend has to go down into the basement of the old house to fiddle
with the water pump. It was dark out by the time he went up the ladder.
When he came to the house. He told me that he had caught a glimps of an
woman in a long black dress from the 1800's or something. He proceddded
in telling me that this woman had dark eyes and looked to be very angry
at him for being in that house. That gave me the chills to here that.</b>
<br><b>The third encounter took place just in the middle of August. My
boyfriend and one of his friends were in the basement fixing on the pump
when they heard footsteps walking around in the old kitchen up above. When
they went to haul water from town it was around ten o'clock at night. I
was standing outside on our deck and all of a sudden the screan door of
the old house started to open and close. The springs on that door are very
good and there was no way that door would open by itself. I can hardly
open it. There was no wind all of the cats and dog were up by me. But I
didn't feel scared, well, maybe a little. When my boyfriend returned I
told him about what had happened he said that him and his friend noticed
and heard the same thing. We did take some pitchers and are waiting for
them to come back. My boyfriend keeps telling me that the spirt is my great-great
grandmother. My family has photos from both sides that we can date back
to the 1850s. When he saw the pitcher of her he told me it reminded him
of the old woman he saw.</b>
<br><b>I have not been out to that farm for two weeks now and my boyfriend
has not senced, seen or has heard her sence I have been away. Maybe she
was my great-great grandmother, perhaps a passer by, or the spirt of someone
who lived in that house long ago. I have yet to see if see is gone or if
she is awaiting my return. If the spirit returns we plan on doing a more
indeph study on this matter. We plan to do an update story if any more
spirits return. Thanks for listening. If anyone want's to ask questions,
please feel free to contact me at the e-mail above.</b>

<p><b>Old Gunn Church</b><b></b>

<p><b>&nbsp;Old Gunn Church in Georgetown, SC, is also the place</b>

<p><b>My Family's Haunted house.</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: babytinybubbles@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I was reading some of the stories on your website, and got chills.
I could seriously relate to some of these people and their stories! I thought
that I was going crazy at the time. About four years ago, my family and
I all lived in the small town of McBain, MI. We had moved into this house
in this town called Lucas about 5 minutes from McBain. It was a beautiful
house, nice and spacious. I have two younger sisters, and they claimed
the two upstairs bedrooms and I ended up with the basement, which was a
huge room surrounded in concrete. I loved it. After moving in we all settled
into our new rooms, made it our own, and enjoyed school and work etc. Well
one night, I came in late and went on down to my room and got in bed. My
bed was facing away from the wooden stairs and it was pitch black in there.
I had just started to fall asleep, when it sounded like someone was walking
down the stairs. I figured it was my sister who would sometimes come and
crawl in bed with me, and I asked her if she needed me to turn on the light.
When I spoke, that someone went flying up the stairs, LOUDLY! I jumped
up fast and turned on the light. Like I said the room was huge, so I started
walking around looking to see if my sister was hiding. I then walked upstairs
and checked in their bedrooms, to find them sound asleep. I checked in
my parents bedroom and saw they were fast asleep snoring and all. Thinking
it was an intruder, I went and checked all the doors only to find them
locked. Very confused, I went back down to my bed and crawled back in.
bout 10 minutes later, the same thing happened. Let me tell you, you have
NEVER seen me jump out of bed that fast and run upstairs! I slept on the
couch the rest of the week. The next couple of months, everything was back
to normal when My grandma ended up moving in with us and into my little
sister's room, so she moved down with me. One night there was a really
bad thunderstorm and we lost power in the house. Grandma was asleep in
her bedroom, so we all just sat in the living room watching the storm and
talking. We saw a light coming from the hallway and my sister went to investigate.
It was coming from my grandma's room, and she was talking to someone. My
dad went in and found her talking to thin air. Her room was the only room
not to lose power! On the entire road! She claimed to be talking to God.
We didn't think anything of it, and respected it. This happened three more
times. Months later, Grandma died, and it all calmed down. Then one night,
my best friend and I went out with two of our guys friends and got back
late, like 4am.&nbsp; We crawled into bed and fell asleep. About 20 minutes
later, Jess woke up shaking and shrieking. I jumped up and saw it too.
In the distance, there was a face. Just a face, glowing. I turned on the
light and it disappeared. My little sister was in a deep sleep. We laughed
it off thinking it was a reflection of my sisters glow in the dark stars
for our own sanity and went back to sleep. Around 9am, Jess and I woke
up to find my entire family standing over us. They claimed they were all
outside and heard blood curdling screams coming from our basement and two
guys yelling. Jess and I were confused and told them that we were asleep
the whole time, and that our guy friends didn't even come in the house
last night. They thought we were joking and got mad at us for scaring them
like that. We shrugged it off, not wanting to admit that we were scared.
A couple weeks later, Jess and I worked at a bar and got out around 4am
and she decided to crash at y place. We walked by the basement steps and
into the kitchen. We saw all the lights on down there, and heard voices,
so we assumed that my little sister was down there watching movies like
she does every night. We got some food and went into the living room to
watch TV, and Jessica tripped over my sisters, who were camping out on
the floor with their friends. We went down to the basement to find all
the lights off and the TV and radio off also. We went back upstairs and
decided to camp out with the little kids also. We swore on our lives we
heard men talking!! A few days later, I was asleep with my sister in our
room, and I woke up to Brittany screaming standing on the stairs bawling!
My mom ran down to comfort her and Brittany was pointing to the back of
my side of the basement where all my clothes were hanging and shaking badly.
I ran upstairs and we tried to calm Britt down. It took a while. She swore
she saw a black being floating over me and my bed. Just hovering. She said
that she woke up earlier that morning to see the same thing going into
my closet and then floating upward coming towards me. She said she thought
she was dreaming and just rolled over and went back to sleep. I got real
scared and mom proceeded to tell us that there was no such things as ghosts.
I met Jess and my other best friend Adam for coffee and told them. Jess
said that animals can sense ghosts and paranormal activity. So we attempted
to take my aunt's dog to the basement, only to have him flip out. He was
whining and yelping. Adam carried him down there and by the time Adam came
back upstairs Boomer was right behind him, Shaking violently. He flew into
the back bedroom and stayed there until my Aunt left. We were scared. Badly.
My sister and I slept upstairs in the spare bedroom until we moved out
a few weeks later. When we moved to NC, my mom admitted to us, that she
thought the house was haunted. She told us she didn't want to scare us,
but she experienced some weird things also. The TV and lights going on
and ff when she was alone in the house. Weird noises, water faucets going
on and off by themselves, the heater turning off by itself, and the temperature
dropping to almost freezing. That was the first and only time, fingers
crossed I had ever experienced anything like that. It was the scariest
time also.</b><b></b>

<p><b>My Children's Births</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: f_duate@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hello, my name is Elizabeth Nichols I live in Corry PA. I have a
two stories I thought I might share with you, though there are many more(some
people call me a magnet). These two though have a special meaning to me.</b>
<br><b>I'll start with a bit of backround information. Eight years ago,
my grandfather became uncontrollable with dementia. My mother, my grandmother,
my cousin, and I went to see him every day, my cousin and I were his favorites
of all the grandchildren. That was our routine every day, wake up, go to
school, then come home and go to the Manor to vist my grandpa. We did this
for a year until my aunt decided to move to South Dakota. the following
year, my cousin became ill with Lukemia. He had a tumor on his spine, right
above the tail bone. The day my aunt told us of this, is the day I found
out I was pregnate. By this point, my grandfather could only reconize two
people, my grandma, and myself. On May, 7th, 1998 I went into labor. My
cousin was schedualed for Radiation on the 12th. My labor was long, and
complicated, On May 11th, 3:15 am, My fiance' put metalica, the black album
in the tape player. he started to rewind it, and then went to put something
in a drawer. The tape mysteriosly stoped at the unforgiven and started
to play it. I g really cold, and started crying for apparently no reason,
I was numbed at this point with an epidural, so it wasn't labor pain. In
South Dakota, my cousin Rod, Undergoing Radiation treatment, turned pale
white, and his body tempature lowered. this feeling lasted with both of
us for at least 5 minnutes. The next day, My daughter was born, My dad
came to the hospital and told me than my grandpa died at 3:15 in the morning.
when My cousin came for the funeral, he told me about his radiation experience.
The whole family belives that he came to say goodbye. One of the most Ironic
things is, my cousins cancer went into remition two months later. MY daughter,
almost died from stress of long labor. He still watches her. Before he
died at the Manor he used to flip through the channels on his tv., and
he used to turn the tv on and off randomly, part of his condition. Before
he was sick he used to play battleship with us. When my daughter was brought
home from the hospital, Cory(her father) saw my granpa standing over her
crib, watching her. When she was 2, I went to see if she was taking a nap
yet, and she had the battle ship game out. She would move a piece, and
the peice on the other board would move. She was only two, and we never
taught her how to play. She still to this day, calms down and relaxes to
Metalica's the unforgiven. When ever you take a picture of her, even profesional
ones, there is a strange "glow" around her. If you turn the tv. off at
my Fathers house, it allways turn back on if there has been a "dispute"
recently. We know, that he is allways going to be watching her, and making
sure she is allways safe.</b>
<br><b>The second one takes place only a year ago, April, 2003.</b>
<br><b>My mother fell ill with Ovarian Cancer. She had been strugling with
Lukemia in her childhood, and it came back to haunt her again three years
ago, only ovarian this time. The day she died was 4-18-2003, my 21st b-day.
She was very confused, and didn't reconize anyone in the room with her,
but about a hour before she died she looked right at me and said Take Care
Of Your children. We thought she ment child, because I only had my daughter
at this point. A month later, the day of her memorial service, I had a
hunch and took a pregnancy test, it was possative. I was not suposed to
be able to have anymore children, or if I did get pregnate, I would miscarry,
and I did miscarry 3 times previous to that. My husband and I were in utter
shock. The doctor calculated the conception date to the day before my mother
died, that day, she was doing well, in fact, she was supposed to go home
on the day she died at the hospital. Several times thoughout my pregnancy
I almost lost the baby, and it was a mirical that I was able to carry her.
Every time I went to the hospital with a complication My husband felt my
moms distinct presance with us. My father woke up one night and she was
laying in bed beside him, she told him to be happy, and then she left.
The day I went into labor(the last time...had several times but labor just
"stopped" for no reason) It stopped again. I begged with my mom for this
not to be another faulse one, and suddenly labor speeded up and I had my
newest(now 7 mo.) daughter an hour later. That night, My husband woke up
and saw my mom standing there, she looked at him and told him that she
was glad we named her "angel". Angelique Lynn was what my mother was going
to name me until my dad changed it. As with my granpa, my mother is watching
angel. I had a friend babysit, she tripped over a baby toy and came about
two inches from stepping on the baby, she sais she felt as if something
shed her in mid air. My mother, when she would get mad had a habit of throwing
things, one day, my brother's girlfriend said something of an insulting
manor about my mom, and a picture flew off the wall, there were at least
7 wittnesses to this.</b>
<br><b>These are just two of the Many I have had, but these to hit home
hard, I'm irish, We are suposed to have a family Banshee, never seen her,
but it seems as if in my family, when a new birth comes, someone dies,
with shanie(my oldest) MY grandpa, and Cory's grandma died, with Angel
My mother and my husbands grandfather died. This seems to happen with everyone
of my generation of the family that has a child, Conincedence? I don't
know..nor does anyone else for that matter.</b>
<br><b>There are also a few other places in this area that are haunted,
at least, this town thinks so, and many have had encounters with the unknown.
I even have a few pics(we think) of something in Mead Park......it could

<p><b>Ghost Following Brother</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: alexthehater@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I am convinced that a ghost is following my brother around and I
have a few ghost stories that happened to him. They are not real scary
but they are true. I know cus i was with him during some of them.</b>
<br><b>It started when he was about 8. By the way he is 25 now. Anyway,
he and a freind were playing around with one of those boards you use to
contact spirits. I forgot what they are called and they never work for
me, and it started spelling kkk. They asked who it was and it spelled out
G-R-N-D&nbsp; W-I-Z-R-D. They were confused because they didnt know what
a Grand Wizard was and it really did leave out the A's. It was probably
a few years later he realized it was one of the leaders of the kkk.</b>
<br><b>Thats about all that happened when he was younger but later when
he went to collage he was on the baseball team. During the trips somthing
would wake him up really early in the morning by touching him on the back
or the head. One of the times in particular it kept touching him throughout
the night. He kept checking to see if a roomate was screwing with him but
they were fast asleep.</b>
<br><b>Another time at his house he was sleeping and he woke up because
it felt like he had been slapped in the back. He laid there for a minute
and somthing slapped him on the back again. Pretty hard too.</b>
<br><b>The times I was with him was when we were camping. We were staying
in a 1 room cabin with a freind. One night i woke up and heard talking.
It was my brother and that freind talking to each other. I asked them was
going on and my brother said he could here breathing outside the window.
I got up and walked to the window by his bed and sure enouph you could
breathing like something was right on the other side but there was nothing
out there. Then the next night we were at the main lodge playing ping pong.
This lodge had thick, heavy, wooden doors that were about 9 feet tall.It
was about 1 in the morning so we decided to leave. When we started going
to the doors both of them flew open and banged against the side of the
lodge like they had beed kicked. There was nothing there and and was perfectly
calm outside.</b><b></b>

<br><b>A Ghostly Warning?</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: sandyfr@iafrica.com A Ghostly Warning?</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>My family and I are now convinced that we were being warned that
a tragedy was about to strike our family.&nbsp; In the course of 2001 we
were ‘contacted’ on a fairly regular basis by some ghostly beings.</b>
<br><b>The first contact – I woke up to see a shadow moving from our open
plan lounge down into the passage area by the bedrooms.&nbsp; The curtains
were closed, all the lights were off.&nbsp; There was no way that there
was enough light in the house or even outside the house. We lived on a
nature reserve, and at night the outside it pitch dark.</b>
<br><b>The second contact – Late one night I was to collect my children
from a party in town, we live about 30kms outside of town.&nbsp; When as
I stepped off the patio onto the driveway, I felt a definite presence to
one side of me.&nbsp; I got such a fright I ran back into the house and
made my husband walk to the car with me.</b>
<br><b>The third contact – Again late one night fetching the children from
another party, I got to an intersection, when out of the corner of my eye
I could see somebody reach for the door – as if to open it.&nbsp; We have
a rather high incidence of hi-jacking so I just drove forward a few meters,
looked in my review mirror, but the intersection was empty, it is well
lit and I swear there was no one there.</b>
<br><b>The fourth contact – I was sitting reading my book outside one beautiful
winter morning, when I heard singing, but not a band or music on a radio,
just what sounded like some local woman singing.&nbsp; Please note that
the nearest house from us was over a kilometer away.&nbsp; And when I got
up to find out where it was coming from the voices stopped.&nbsp; I then
carried on reading my book and after a while became conscious that the
singing was back. This happened approximately 4 times before it faded completely.</b>
<br><b>The fifth contact – Late one night – fetching the children from
a party, I was driving along the driveway when I looked into my rearview
mirror and I saw a definite silhouette of someone sitting in the middle
of the back seat blocking my view.&nbsp; I spun around to see who was there.&nbsp;
There was nobody there!</b>
<br><b>The last contact – my husband woke me up one morning to tell me
he had a visitor during the course of the night.&nbsp; A lady in a long
red dress was standing by his bed, and when he went to wake me up so that
I could see her, she disappeared.&nbsp; I subsequently felt someone sitting
at the bottom of the bed, but when I looked there is no one there.</b>
<br><b>My son died on the 21st of September 2001, we have had no contact
since then, nothing strange has happened.&nbsp; Our lives while shattered
have not been visited by other beings.&nbsp; I have come to realize that
maybe these sightings were meant to be taken as a warning, most of the
“sightings” manifested themselves on the way to pick him up from a party
late at night.&nbsp; My son was killed late at night whilst at a party.</b>

<br><b>"Paranormal Experience?"</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: bhbh1966@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I am a lifelong resident of Pennsylvania, born in</b>
<br><b>August 1966. My father, Donald Haskins, made a living</b>
<br><b>by painting houses. While on his way home from work,</b>
<br><b>in July 1968, he was killed in a horrible truck accident.</b>
<br><b>Almost three years later my oldest brother Larry came</b>
<br><b>home late, about 10P.M. Not expecting anything out</b>
<br><b>of the ordinary he went up the stairs to his room.</b>
<br><b>There he found a most unexpected surprise. My father</b>
<br><b>appeared, to my brother's astonishment. He asked my</b>
<br><b>brother about how the family was doing. After the</b>
<br><b>initial shock wore off, momentarily, my brother managed</b>
<br><b>to tell my father that we were all well. As quickly as he</b>
<br><b>appeared, my father disappeared. The next morning,</b>
<br><b>Larry told my mother. She told him that he was imagining</b>
<br><b>things.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A few months after my father's death, February
1968,</b>
<br><b>the Johnsons moved into the house behind the one we</b>
<br><b>my family was renting. Mr. and Mrs. Johnson and their</b>
<br><b>daughter Marie became our family friends.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In June 1974 my family moved to another
town, some</b>
<br><b>26 miles up the road. In August 1974, Marie and her husband Wayne,
they married in May 1972, moved into</b>
<br><b>the house we had been renting.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In April 1975 Marie was ironing clothes
in her kitchen.</b>
<br><b>Suddenly, Wayne came charging downstairs, telling</b>
<br><b>Marie that he had seen a glowing man in their bedroom.</b>
<br><b>She went upstairs to see what was going on, she thought</b>
<br><b>that maybe Wayne was drunk or something. In her own</b>
<br><b>words, she said she saw "a strange glow coming from the</b>
<br><b>bedroom." Then she saw "an older looking man in painter</b>
<br><b>overalls with his hat cocked sideways on his head." Marie</b>
<br><b>had never met my father, but my mother had told her</b>
<br><b>family that he had been a painter. She figured it must be</b>
<br><b>him, so she told him where we had moved. Before she could</b>
<br><b>say another word he was gone.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In June 1975 Marie and Wayne came to visit
my family.</b>
<br><b>Eventually. she talked about it with my mother. What</b>
<br><b>caught my mother's attention was the way he wore his hat.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I never met my father and I have no personal
memories</b>
<br><b>of him. I never saw my father's ghost either. It could</b>
<br><b>simply be a great story to tell the kids.</b><b></b>

<p><b>My Stories from a Few Years</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Jmeghann.jordan@mcchord.af.mil</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Experience 1</b>
<br><b>I was 14 years old and I had just experienced my first death of
a loved one, little did I know it would be my first encounter with a ghost.&nbsp;
My mother came to me and told me that her best friend and my godmother
had committed suicide after battling with schizophrenia for many years.
On Mother’s Day 1993 I laid in my bed crying, the door to my room was closed
and the light from the television in the next room flickered through the
small opening under the door.&nbsp; I sat up wiping the tears from my eyes
to see the door to the bedroom no longer there, and my beloved friend staring
back at me.&nbsp; She floated a few inches above the ground and her beautiful
red hair danced around her head from a breeze that surrounded her. I sat
there stunned and amazed as she looked upon me with love in her eyes. With
one look I understood that she was happier, and that she needed to escape
from an uncontrollable and painful life.&nbsp; I kept this experience to
myself for many years, believing that my heart was giving my mind comfort.&nbsp;
When I was 20 years old I returned home from Basic Training, and decided
to tell my mother about the incident.&nbsp; After I told her, she looked
at me with amazement.&nbsp; She asked me what she was wearing, and I told
her I remember a long ruffled cream colored dress, and then a smile came
over her face. She said that she visited her too that night and she thought
that it was her heart playing tricks on her too, but now knew that it was
real.&nbsp; My dear friend has yet to visit me again in body but I know
that she is with me, because I can feel her presence all around me.</b>
<br><b>Experience 2</b>
<br><b>I was stationed on an Air Force base in Altus Oklahoma for many
years and I had occupied a dorm room on base for over 2 years.&nbsp; It
was a small dorm room and I shared a bathroom with another girl.&nbsp;
I decided that I no longer wanted to live on base so I rented an apartment
off base, but soon that became too expensive and moved back into my room.&nbsp;
During the six months I was gone something must have happened because I
did not return to the same room that I left.&nbsp; The signs started out
real small. The first sign of something out of the ordinary came the first
day I moved back in. I was sleeping on a mattress on the floor and I had
placed the remote to the television right beside the mattress, I started
to drift off and went to grab the remote to turn off the TV and it was
clear across the room.&nbsp; The presence of something supernatural grew
with each day that passed.&nbsp; My stereo would turn all the way up, the
VCR would start fast-forwarding or rewinding a movie that we were watching.
I would tell my friends of the small ghostly signs that I was experiencing
and every time someone didn’t believe me right then and there something
would happen.&nbsp; One night my best friend came to visit me, while we
were talking she screamed then ran right outside the door. She said that
she saw a thick white light swish into my bathroom, and then the next night
as another friend and I were leaving he said that when he shut the door
he saw a thick white light swish into the room from the outside.&nbsp;
We started calling the ghost Bob whenever he would visit us, and we all
just got a good laugh out of it, but soon it became to hard to handle.
Bob, became violent.&nbsp; One time he knocked all of my picture frames
off of my window sill, he dropped a phone that was bolted onto the wall
on to a friends head and at night he would slam my wall locker doors open
and shut.&nbsp; I started to sleep in another friends room because it was
causing me to lose sleep.&nbsp; One day we were hanging out and there were
people sitting on my bed and all of a sudden the edge of the mattress lifted
up like someone just came up and kicked the bed.&nbsp; I had asked around
to see if there were any out of the ordinary incidents that had occurred
on the base but there was nothing.&nbsp; After months and months of harassment
my visitor left as quickly as he came.&nbsp; To this day I don’t know what
caused him to come spend sometime with me, but I do know that he made a
believer out of a lot of people.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Don't mess with Bell</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: gconly85@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Some time ago I was on a cross country trip with my friends Brian
and Josh. We were traveling to New Jersey from Oklahoma. The closer we
got to our destination, the more ghost stories and spooky happenings we
heard about. Most of them were from slightly balding, midddle-aged men
with no teeth and overalls. About twenty miles into tennessee, Brian became
extremely excited about a ghost story about "The Bell Witch". I had heard
a few things about this story, but really never paid attention to it. We
got to this town called Clarksville and stopped for gas. Just to see if
there was anything to this story, I asked the clerk at the counter if he
had heard of The Bell Witch. He quickly perked up, and launched into a
story about his encounter with her. A customer behind me tried to outdue
the clerk with his terrifying adventure into the ghostly beyond. They told
me that if I was interested in seeing the cave where she still "lives",
I could go visit it. They gave me directions and I raced back to the my
friends. We jumped into the car and we made our way to Adams, Tennessee.
We reached the former farm and took a tour of the re-creation of the Bell's
cabin and then they took we went to the cave. All three of us became interested
in this story. We decided to get a hotel and come back after the cave is
closed to get a closer look around...BAD IDEA!! We collected our flashlights
and headed back around 1 a.m. found a back road and decided to walk the
rest of the way. We found the cave entrance but this area is not easiest
place to get in. So the trip wasn't an entire loss we walked around the
grounds to see what we could find. After about thirty minutes of endless
searching we made our way to the top of a hill and sat down to take a rest.
I guess Josh was fustrated at the failure of our trip so he said so very
bad curses about The Bell Witch. He wanted to go back to the cave to get
a rock to remember our experience. We snuck down to the front of the cave
and grabbed rocks and headed back. When we got back to the car we stuck
the rocks in a sock and piled into the car. I tried to start the car and
nothing happened. There was no reason for us to have car trouble. The car
we were driving in was only a few month old and had a full tank of gas.
I popped the hood an got out to see what the trouble was and was eventually
joined by the other two. As we stood over the engine guessing what the
trouble could be. From behind us came a horrid laughter that was accompanied
by gust of wind. Josh was knocked to the ground and the car started up
with no one inside. Brian and I rushed to Josh's aid. We helped him to
his feet and he kept holding the side of his face. He removed his hand
to reveal a handprint across his face. We raced to the car and reached
the hotel room without saying a single word to one another. In the morning,
Josh had fully recovered and we found that our sock full of rocks had gone
missing.</b>

<br><b>Investigated</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Alylews@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>My name is Alexa and I have a stiry to tell. It has happened many
times now, and I believe that my house may be haunted. The first time,
I was sleeping in my mothers room on a oull out bed, and I started to hear
something that sounded like someone knocking on the door. I got fraeked
out, because the next thing that happened was footsteps walking across
the hall floor. So I just sqwenched my eyes together and went to sleep.
And that has been going on for about a year now, but thats not as freaky
as the next thing. One night, I had just woken up from a scary dream that
ended with a murder opening my door, the next thing that happened was my
door, that I had made sure I closed before getting into bed, starting to
open up by itself. So, by instint, I ran as fat as my legs could take me
to my mom's room. We had one of those "spirit" people come in to check
out the hiuse and he said that he did find some stuff "floating" around.
He even tried to take any evil spirits out of us! But then again, those
guys will always say that they found something. And I have the feeling,
that those little hauntings, are just the begining.</b>

<p><b>Large Eyes</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: wildbirdz1@wmsnet.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>When I was a small child we lived in an older home. My bedroom was
very</b>
<br><b>small and on the second floor, one window, two doors. One to the
attic</b>
<br><b>the other to the hall. One evening I was sleeping in my bed and
I had</b>
<br><b>woken up and was trying to get back to sleep. I turned onto my stomach</b>
<br><b>and closed my eyes. A few minutes later all the blankets on me flew
onto</b>
<br><b>the floor at the foot of my bed really fast. I was petrified. I
layed</b>
<br><b>there scared to move. Finally I turned over and saw to large yellow
eyes</b>
<br><b>in a dark corner. I sat up on my bed and looked at them. They were
as</b>
<br><b>close to me as two feet. They were also the same height as me sitting
on</b>
<br><b>my bed (about 3 feet). Very large eyes with black slits going down
the</b>
<br><b>middle. I was very scared though I began to talk to it. I don't
know</b>
<br><b>what I said or how long I talked to it. Suddenly I got really terrified</b>
<br><b>and yelled for my mom to come in. I never took my eyes off of them
for</b>
<br><b>fear it would get me. My dad opened my bedroom door and the eyes
quickly</b>
<br><b>went underneath my bureau. I told him what had happened and he said
I</b>
<br><b>must have had a nightmare. This happened over 30 years ago. It was
not a</b>
<br><b>nightmare. I have had many other experiences in my life to know

<p><b>Hauntings Revised</b><b></b>

<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>My studies of my ancestors, Nick McGrath and Milwaukee Harbormaster
Martin</b>
<br><b>Dooley (aka, Doorley), reveal terrible hauntings from Milwaukee's
past, where the</b>
<br><b>schooner 'Augusta of Oswego' rammed and sank the USM Lady Elgin
with many</b>
<br><b>members of Milwaukee's militia companies on board.....the Union
Guards, the</b>
<br><b>Light Guards, the Green Yagers, the Black Yagers, Milwaukee City
Band, etc,</b>
<br><b>on Sept 8, 1860. Within a month, the Guard's warehouse was burned
down, and</b>
<br><b>according to the Milwaukee Sentinel of September 4, 1892, per the
Lady Elgin</b>
<br><b>Survivor's Society, which formed to recreate records lost in the
Great Third Ward</b>
<br><b>Fire of 1892, "one man, named Nick McGrath, who lived on Erie Street,
in the Third</b>
<br><b>Ward, floated into the mouth of the Milwaukee River, a month after
(the shipwreck),</b>
<br><b>and went ashore on his own place (Dooley Martin, Dousman &amp; Company,</b>
<br><b>Forwarding and Commision Agents, South Pier, Foot of Erie Street)."</b>
<br><b>Talk about ghosts!</b>
<br><b>At the time the militia companies were being recruited for Democrat

secession</b>
<br><b>in the vast Western Utah territory, secession in the Southern States,
and</b>

<br><b>President of the Territories of the USA, during the administration

<br><b>President James Buchanan. Republican pacifist lawyer Abraham Lincoln
defeated</b>
<br><b>Douglas in the 1860 Presidential election, but rapidly formed a

<br><b>with Douglas to join the 'manifest destiny' movement to crush Southern
