<P><B>Ghost..</B>

<BR><B>&nbsp;You know how on the site you say that ghosts will try to contact
through dreams? Well I'm 17 now but when I was 11 my grandfather died.
About a week after he died I had a dream that we were redoing his house,
because my family did to sell it, and he was sitting there beside me. I
asked him if I was the only one who could see him and he said yes. I asked
him why he was there, and he said that he wanted to tell me that he is
alright and that he is doing ok where is he now. So, I guess ghosts really
do try to contact you in your dreams.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Ghost Story</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: samanthalee@alltel.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>HI,</B>
<BR><B>My name is Samantha and I am from Louisville, KY.&nbsp; This is
my story.</B>
<BR><B>My brother was killed in the vietnam war at age 19 in 1971.&nbsp;
After his death WIERD things starting happening.&nbsp; This is how the
story began. My other brother Steve had a bedroom upstairs.&nbsp; He would
play his music so loud all the time in his room, mom thought it was a teen
age thing.&nbsp; Well one day, mom finally asked him why on earth he plays
his music so loud, much to moms amazement this is what he told her "I play
the music loud because someone else is in my room".&nbsp; Well, one day
everyone started hearing footsteps up and down the stair way and in the
2 bedrooms upstairs.&nbsp; You would expect someone to come down any minute,
but no one was up there.&nbsp; One day Steve was packing, he was getting
married, moving out.&nbsp; He said he heard a voice calling out to him
"Steve???", as in, are you leaving?&nbsp; It freaked him out.&nbsp; A day
or so later, he said to the noise maker, "Bobby if that is you give me
a sign so I know".&nbsp; Within seconds the horn on the truck began to
blow, Steve looked out the window, no one was out there.......</B>
<BR><B>After Steve left the spirit began getting lonely I guess you could
say, it roamed from upstairs to downstairs.&nbsp; The footsteps got louder
and more intense.&nbsp; My mom says she saw me get up and go into the kitchen,
well, when she went to yell at me to get back in bed I was fast asleep.&nbsp;
When I was 5 years old (2 years after his death), I woke up and had to
go to the bathroom really bad, Bobby was standing at the foot of my bed,
I froze, I couldn't move I was so scared.&nbsp; One night my friend and
I were playing a game, and across the room a pillow flew, grazed the top
of my head.&nbsp; I went in and told my mom that wasn't funny, that she
scared me, she didn't know what I was talking about.&nbsp; She swore til
the day she died that she did not throw that pillow at me.&nbsp; One day,
I went down to my friends house to smoke ciggarettes (I was 10 at this
time), Steve was in the backyard in the pool.&nbsp; I locked the front
door and went out the back.&nbsp; When I got home, Steve was outside working
on the car again,&nbsp; I walked in the house to find it different, the
rocking chair was moved in the hall way, I moved it over, wondering why
Steve did that, went down the hall to my room and my room was trashed,
my bedsheets were off the bed in a neat little pile in the corner, my mattress
was half way off the bed, my papers were gone through, etc.&nbsp; I ran
outside and asked Steve what he was doing in my room and he said he hasn't
been in the house since I left. I told him he had to or someone else was,
he said no one could of gone in because he was working on the car most
of the time.&nbsp; He didn't believe me so he went in and was floored at
what he saw (needless to say, I have never smoked again...lol) .&nbsp;
This is only some of the things that went on over the years......</B>
<BR><B>In 1978, my father died, the day of his death it all stopped.&nbsp;
No more footsteps, no more voices, no more shadows.&nbsp; Was this really
my brother?&nbsp; Was he waiting for someone to go to the light with him,
was he lonely?&nbsp; We have never&nbsp; found out the answers, now as
a grown up myself, I wish I had the chance to talk to him or see him again
like I did when I was little.&nbsp; But I was so scared of ghosts then,
now I find them fasinating.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Ghost Haunting</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Southernwolf222@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hello!&nbsp; I don't know where to begin, so I guess I'll just start
with the beginning.</B>
<BR><B>We lived on the second floor of a 2-flat on the Northwest Side of
Chicago 14 years ago.&nbsp; Three nights after moving in, we began hearing
heavy foot steps walking through the house.&nbsp; They only walked at evening/night
time.&nbsp; At first, naturally, we were scared to death.&nbsp; They would
stop right at the doorway of our bedroom.&nbsp; The footsteps however,
did not wake up our 2 year old daughter.</B>
<BR><B>A year later and night after night, we continued to hear the steps.&nbsp;
We began to realize the ghost was not going to hurt us, so life continued
on with him in the house.&nbsp; We know it was a him, because here's the
best part of the story:</B>
<BR><B>One night after dinner, I was in the kitchen sitting at the table
drinking coffee with my baby in her high chair right next to me.&nbsp;
My 3 year old and her friend from the first floor had been running up and
down from apartment to apartment.&nbsp; Finally, they went down stairs.&nbsp;
A couple minutes later, my friend's little girl came running through the
front door, and was heading toward the hallway to the bedrooms.&nbsp; As
she neared the doorway for the hallway, a very strong man's voice spoke.&nbsp;
He told her to be careful.&nbsp; She answered him!&nbsp; She said she is.</B>
<BR><B>I grabbed my baby out of the high chair and ran downstairs.&nbsp;
I don't know why I did that.&nbsp; He was obviously a good ghost.&nbsp;
Even though we were used to him, the voice still scared me.</B>
<BR><B>But let me tell you also, that we had a dog, and so did my friends
downstairs.&nbsp; However, in the middle of the night, my friend's dog
would bark in a threatening sound toward their dining room, but she would
not step a paw into the dining room.</B>
<BR><B>So we figured the ghost must have been somebody who lived in the
building at one time.&nbsp; He was still there when we moved out.&nbsp;
We did not move out because of him, we just needed more room with a growing
family.</B>
<BR><B>I never did any research on the building, but I wished I had.&nbsp;
There were other things he would do in the apartment.&nbsp; I know for
a fact he played a joke on the kitten we had the time.&nbsp; Except I don't
think he meant for it to scare me.</B>
<BR><B>I always believed in ghosts, but actually having the chance to live
with one is quite an experience.&nbsp; Everyone I have told the story to,
don't believe it.&nbsp; So I quit telling it.&nbsp; However, my friend's
daughter who is now 14, still remembers answering that voice that told
her to be careful.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Escondido Cemetery</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: sean743@juno.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hello,</B><B></B>

<P><B>This experience literally caused me to sleep with the lights on for
about two weeks; even at the ripe old age of 26 when it happened.</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp; a.. Cemetery in Escondido, CA. (I cannot remember the name
of the cemetery, but I do remember being back in the hills of Escondido).</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; b.. An evening in August 1993 (Sorry, can't remember the
actual date).</B>
<BR><B>I was at my friend "Deemers" apartment with his friend "John". John
said that he knew of a haunted cemetery in Escondido and wanted to know
if we all would like to go and see it. He swore that this place&nbsp; had
a reputation in the area for being haunted. Of course, I jumped at the
offer and the three of us piled into my car and ventured into Escondido.</B><B></B>

<P><B>When we arrived, the place even looked haunted. The scenery was something
out of Stephen King to start with. John and I walked down the dirt road
to the cemetery; Deemers chickened out and stayed in the car (maybe he
was the smart one).</B><B></B>

<P><B>There were a handful of houses around; very rural area. When we got
to the cemetery; neither of&nbsp; us had the courage to actually go into
the cemetery, so we stayed outside the fence and pressed ourselves against
it and strained to get a look at everything. We were there maybe 15 minutes
tops when the strangest of things began to happen:</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp; a.. John first noticed small green orbs floating around some
of the old above ground tombstones. At first I thought we was making things
up; he had a flair for practical jokes. Then I saw these glowing green
orbs floating around the tombstones; almost as if they were playing in
a childlike manner. They were swaying about and almost skipping around
the markers. I must admit it was really fascinating to watch.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; b.. Right about that time these large birds were flying overheard.
I couldn't make out what they were, but I could tell they were large. Maybe
this was a coincidence, but it was starting to give me the creeps like
we shouldn't be there.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; c.. (This part I will swear before the Grand Jury is true;
I'm still get the creeps after almost a decade. In fact, I'm getting them
now). John and I were beginning to wonder if we should head back to the
car, but we had our minds made up for us. Suddenly there was the noise
of&nbsp; someone in the cemetery running towards us at a rapid pace. These
footsteps were just running, but actually stomping, as if&nbsp; someone
was really ticked, mad, pissed-off, what ever you want to inject as an
adjective. Mind you, it was almost a full moon, so the grounds were pretty
well lit by the moonlight and we saw nothing but darkness. These running/stomping
noises were getting louder and closer. I turned to John and asked with
the big sound of fright, "You think we oughtta leave?". He looked at me
and said "Yeah."; I had never seen John scared before, but this time is
was petrified and it was not an act. The footsteps were almost upon us;
we jumped off the embankment and onto the dirt road. Suddenly, it got cold...I
mean a good 40 degree drop in temperature. It was a hot, blamy, August
night and suddenly I was cold with goose bumps. This part is hard to believe,
unless you&nbsp; were there, suddenly a strong wind came up and began encircling
us. I could actually feel the wind trying to crush me as it wound around
me; John was experiencing the same thing too. This wind was blowing hard;
however, there was no dirt coming off the road and the bushes on the side
of the road were not moving. It was really scary; we literally felt this
wind pushing us back up the road. I mentioned the trees weren't moving
and John noticed it too. This wind literally followed us up the road, around
a bend in the road, and as soon as we got to the car and opened the doors
to get in, the wind stopped. About a week later, we toyed with going back
to the cemetery with cameras and tape recorders and thought better of it.
Maybe this time, we wouldn't get off so easily. So the idea was dropped.</B>
<BR><B>As I stated, I slept with my lights on for almost two weeks. I kept
reliving that scene over and over. I still think about it now and get the
creeps. I mentioned it too my Mother the next day; she also thinks that&nbsp;&nbsp;
someone or something didn't want us there and was making it very well known.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Dark Figure</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: bonew@bigpond.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I cannot recall why I what I was worried about that made me so restless
and sleepless one night. But you know how at night, your eyes adjust and
you can see a little bit? Well, for some reason, when I was laying in bed
this night, I felt really really cold. I wrapped the covers around me tighter,
and tried to sleep. But I was still freezing. So I opened my eyes again,
and all I could see was pitch black. But it was blacker than a normal black.
And I felt this presence - this figure - standing by my bed. My heart was
racing, but I just lay there. Then I felt the presence touch my hand. And
I remember not feeling scared anymore. When the presence touched me I felt
all warm. And then I feel asleep. It happens again every once in a while.
It doesn't matter where I am sleeping. If I am worried so much that I can't
sleep at night this spirit visits me and conforts me in a way no one ever
has.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Dark Figure Named Herb</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: pch.inc2@verizon.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hi, I have been reading your website for a few years now, and just
absolutely love it!&nbsp; I have been intrigued by ghosts and hauntings
for as long as I can remember.&nbsp; I have really never had an experience
myself, but have heard lots of stories that I find very interesting, and
have started my own log of the stories that I would like to turn into a
book.&nbsp; Anyway, the story I would like to submit is an experience that
happened to my boyfriend.&nbsp; He is a skeptic, and respects my beliefs
and never tells me he thinks I’m crazy because I love to read ghost stories.&nbsp;
This is what he told me happened to him about 4 months ago.&nbsp; He lives
in a back room/house behind his parents house in Redondo Beach, CA.&nbsp;
The house is probably about 50 yrs old or so.&nbsp; Well, one night, he
was half awake, half sleeping.&nbsp; He said he knows he was waking up
because he had noticed that he did not fall asleep with the TV on for once
in his life!&nbsp; All of a sudden, he heard someone/something say “Herb”
at least that’s the best he could make out of it.&nbsp; He thought to himself,
“did I just hear that?” he went to turn around, and found himself frozen.&nbsp;
He had a similar thing like this happen before, and was determined to turn
around and see what/who was there.&nbsp; Then this “thing” started pounding
him on his back, and with all his might, he went to turn around, and for
a split second, saw a dark figure hovering over him, and then, and this
is the scariest part, the “thing” bit him on the palm of his hand!&nbsp;
He couldn’t wait to call me the next day and tell me all about it.&nbsp;
I went back over a couple days later, and was scared, but was hoping something
would happen to me, but it didn’t!&nbsp; I believe him 100%, because like
I said, he’s wasn’t a believer, until “Herb” paid him a visit!&nbsp; I
have other stories that I will submit at another time.&nbsp; Thanks for
taking the time to listen!</B>

<BR><B>Weary Road</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Jokin94@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I was first introduced to this place about 6 years ago,I haven't
been back since. Weary road is in southern wisconsin just outside of Evansville.It
is pretty much a deserted road that has some seriously strange things going
on there. THe first time that I was there we arrived approx. 1100 p.m.
with 5 other people we began to "walk the road" we got about 1/4 of the
way down this road when I got the strangest feeling that we were not alone.
This fear grew in me to the point of hysteria and I wanted to leave.The
group thought that this might be a good idea also so we turned aroud when
all of a sudden there was this huge ruckus in the trees and something unseen
to any of us flashed past right in front of us.We screamed then ran out
of fear but it was like it was following us When we got back to the cars
to leave I looked down at my arms that were now burning and noticed that
I had 5 finger-like scratches down both arms! This alarmed me a bit since
I don't remember getting scratched but then there was the ever distinctful
smell of kerasene in the air.With that we High tailed it out of there only
to return a few nights later with a new theroy in mind to make it down
the road again.I must say that this place scares the hell out of me and
the thing is that there is a true story behind the haunting of Weary road.It
is funny how mad people from the town get when you bring it up.Oh and the
fact that a boy was killed on that road a few years back adds to the mystery.</B><B></B>

<P><B>True Story</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: cherry14_00_2000@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>i was at this cemetary around 9pm. one night with a</B>
<BR><B>few of my friends.</B>
<BR><B>Whial we were walking around, i all of a sudden</B>
<BR><B>started fellin very sick, not unnormal for me.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Keep in mind, this is out in the woods near a</B>
<BR><B>hunting lease, it's a full moon, and it's shaped into</B>
<BR><B>a circle. one of those that you can drive all the way</B>
<BR><B>around.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; well, one of my friends helped me to the car, as i</B>
<BR><B>turned around to say thank-you she was gone. it was so</B>
<BR><B>weird, because really she had no time to go anywhere.</B>
<BR><B>i tried not to think about it as i locked all 4 doors.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; but when i looked back into the cemetary, i didn't</B>
<BR><B>see a soul. Nobody, and this is a pretty small</B>
<BR><B>cemetary too.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; well this got me looking. After awhile i started to</B>
<BR><B>notice these two white lights fling around this one</B>
<BR><B>area. i knew right then what i was looking at, no</B>
<BR><B>doubt about it.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; But the thing i still can't figure out is why</B>
<BR><B>couldn't i see anyone inside that cemetary untill they</B>
<BR><B>stepped foot on the road, and why couldn't my friends</B>
<BR><B>see the spirits? They were in there with them.</B><B></B>

<P><B>The House on Hall Ave</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: ribbon@cybrzn.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>This story is about a house that my sister, myself and a girlfriend
had rented in 1984.I never knew if ghosts were real or not ,I had just
heard of storys before or seen them on tv ,but was never really interested
in them like Iam now.My sister and myself had rented the upstairs apartment
and my girlfriend and her 2 kids rented the lower apartment downstairs
,This was a nice comforable house in a small town in Wisconsin. We were
so excited to rent this house together as we were all close and our kids
could play together. At first we started hearing heavy footsteps in the
attic in the upstairs apartment as if someone was walking back and forth.These
could be heard at different times of the day or night. The water would
turn on by itself in the bathroom sink, lights went on and off by them
selves.We also would see shadows and my sisters bedroom closet was so cold
and erie feeling that we never wanted to go in there. Then there were the
dreams we all were having ,The same dreams of being in the house and seeing
all these people in white with no faces,and it felt like it was a struggle
to wake up like we were drugged, feeling very tired after we had awoken.The
worst part of the whole thing is when my sister had been watching tv in
her bedroom in the earlier afternoon.When she seen a black figure at the
end of her bed.It was pulling her towards it like her soul was leaving
her body and her vision was going black,she started to pray to god to please
help her and at that moment she was wisked back into her body and the black
figure was gone.This scared us to move out and we havent had any problems
since.I dont know what was in that house or what the black figure was that
appeared to my sister but it was enough to make a believer out of all of
us. Something evil was in that house and I often wonder if the new renters
have the same problems ,as I pass that house all the time.Iam just glad
that I dont live there anymore.</B><B></B>

<P><B>THE HORROR OF DRUID HILL</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Hrorstrys@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My aunt Lisa lived in a section of my town called
"The Shady Side."&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>remember when I was younger, I used to hear stories about how sting
things</B>
<BR><B>happened there.&nbsp; I never believed it, I was convinced that
it was just an</B>
<BR><B>Urban Myth.&nbsp; When my friends heard I had an aunt who lived
on Druid Hill,</B>
<BR><B>they told me that she must have been crazy.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I believed that it was all just stories until
I heard about the strange</B>
<BR><B>things that happened at my Aunt's house.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It all began when my cousin Michael complained
that someone was pulling</B>
<BR><B>the covers off of him at night.&nbsp; My aunt and uncle both told
him that he must</B>
<BR><B>have thrown them off himself in his sleep, but he claimed that he
was awake</B>
<BR><B>when they were pulled.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A few weeks went by, and Michael was hardly getting
any sleep.&nbsp; He began</B>
<BR><B>to complain that he would wake up and see an old lady with a distorted
face</B>
<BR><B>sitting on the end of his bed.&nbsp; She would whisper to him in
a language that</B>
<BR><B>he didn't understand.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Around the same time, my aunt would complain
that every morning when she</B>
<BR><B>went to her jewelry box, her favorite necklace would be missing.&nbsp;
She would</B>
<BR><B>find it in strange places in the house.&nbsp; She blamed it on my
cousins, and</B>
<BR><B>they would deny it.&nbsp; One time her necklace disappeared completely.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Things began to get very strange after that.&nbsp;
My cousin's dog "Tyson"</B>
<BR><B>refused to go into certain parts of the house.&nbsp; The two main
rooms that he</B>
<BR><B>seemed absolutely terrified to enter were my cousin Michael's room
and the</B>
<BR><B>basement.&nbsp; One time Michael tried to get Tyson to sleep in
his room to scare</B>
<BR><B>away what he referred to as "The Weird Face Lady," and Tyson put
up a fight.</B>
<BR><B>As soon as Tyson entered the room, he urinated and vomited all over
the</B>
<BR><B>floor.&nbsp; Then he began to have a seizure.&nbsp; The next day
they took him to the</B>
<BR><B>vet, and he said that nothing was physically wrong with the dog,
and he</B>
<BR><B>guessed it was due to fright.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That night things began to get very strange.&nbsp;
All day lights and</B>
<BR><B>appliances were going on and off by themselves.&nbsp; The blender
started working</B>
<BR><B>when it wasn't even plugged in.&nbsp; After dinner everything seemed
to quiet</B>
<BR><B>down, but suddenly all of the lights in the house went out at once.&nbsp;
They</B>
<BR><B>thought maybe it was a blackout or a brown out, but after talking
to all of</B>
<BR><B>their neighbors, they found out that their house was the only house
without</B>
<BR><B>lights.&nbsp; My uncle Rich tried to see if it was a problem with
the fuse box.</B>
<BR><B>He could not find a problem anywhere.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My cousin Dave tried screwing the light bulb
in the lamp in his bedroom,</B>
<BR><B>and realized that it had been unscrewed.&nbsp; They discovered that
strangely all</B>
<BR><B>of the light bulbs in the house had been unscrewed at once.&nbsp;
When my uncle</B>
<BR><B>screwed in the light bulb on the light in the kitchen, he found
my aunt's</B>
<BR><B>necklace in the light fixture.&nbsp; My aunt was horrified at the
knowledge that</B>
<BR><B>none of my cousins could have placed her necklace in the fixture,
even if</B>
<BR><B>they tried standing on a chair.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That night my uncle woke up unable to breathe.&nbsp;
He said that it felt like</B>
<BR><B>a hand was grasping his neck, but no one was there.&nbsp; He went
to get a drink</B>
<BR><B>of water, and he heard footsteps following him into the kitchen.&nbsp;
He looked</B>
<BR><B>back, and saw no one was there.&nbsp; After he put his cup away,
he thought he</B>
<BR><B>heard a voice say "We won't leave."</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next morning Michael looked as though he
were a corpse.&nbsp; He seemed</B>
<BR><B>very shaken, and was reluctant to talk.&nbsp; Finally he told my
aunt and uncle</B>
<BR><B>that the woman in his room told him to kill himself.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My aunt and uncle didn't know what to do.&nbsp;
They admitted that strange</B>
<BR><B>things had been occurring, but they didn't believe in ghosts.&nbsp;
They decided</B>
<BR><B>that Michael needed to see a psychiatrist.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next night My uncle Rich woke up again, only
this time it was because</B>
<BR><B>he heard his closet door open.&nbsp; Then he heard the closet door
close.&nbsp; He</B>
<BR><B>turned on the light, and saw something that churned his stomach.&nbsp;
He saw a</B>
<BR><B>black mist floating from his closet to his bedroom door.&nbsp; Then
his bedroom</B>
<BR><B>door opened by itself, and he saw the black mist float down the
hallway</B>
<BR><B>toward Michael's bedroom.&nbsp; Then the mist entered Michael's
room and the door</B>
<BR><B>to the room slammed shut.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Uncle Rich rushed to Michael's room, and frantically
tried to open the</B>
<BR><B>door, but it would budge.&nbsp; It wasn't locked, because he could
turn the knob,</B>
<BR><B>but something was forcing the door shut.&nbsp; After a minute of
banging on the</B>
<BR><B>door and calling out Michael's name, it opened by itself.&nbsp;
He looked in the</B>
<BR><B>room, and feel to his knees in horror...Michael was standing on
his bed</B>
<BR><B>holding his father's gun to his head.&nbsp; He was speaking in a
language that he</B>
<BR><B>didn't understand.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Uncle Rich drew up the strength to leap from
the floor, and tackle his</B>
<BR><B>son, and took the gun from Michael's hand.&nbsp; Michael stared
up at him, and</B>
<BR><B>Uncle Rich swears that Michael had no eyes, they were completely
black.&nbsp; Al</B>
<BR><B>of a sudden the black cleared, and Michael began to cry.&nbsp; He
claimed that the</B>
<BR><B>last thing he remembered was waking up and seeing the "Weird Face
Woman" on</B>
<BR><B>the end of his bed, and then he blacked out.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aunt Lisa and Uncle Rich decided to get some
help.&nbsp; They asked a priest</B>
<BR><B>from our church to bless their house.&nbsp; The priest finished
the blessing, and</B>
<BR><B>then asked if he could talk to my uncle alone.&nbsp; Uncle Rich
said that the</B>
<BR><B>priest told him that there was one room he wasn't able to bless.&nbsp;
It was the</B>
<BR><B>basement.&nbsp; He said that something drove him out of the basement.&nbsp;
There was</B>
<BR><B>an overwhelming feeling of devastation that came over him.&nbsp;
He told my uncle</B>
<BR><B>that when he went into the basement, he felt as if he was going
to go mad.</B>
<BR><B>He felt a deep depression, and he wanted to commit suicide.&nbsp;
He said that</B>
<BR><B>someone else was going to have to come back to the house and finish
the</B>
<BR><B>blessing.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next weekend my cousin Jessica came home
from college.&nbsp; My aunt and</B>
<BR><B>uncle hesitated to tell her about the occurrences at the house,
because she</B>
<BR><B>has had a history of personal problems.&nbsp; She was often depressed
because she</B>
<BR><B>was born handicapped.&nbsp; She had cerebral palsy, and her classmates
treated her</B>
<BR><B>poorly. My aunt and uncle prayed that since after the priest blessed
the</B>
<BR><B>majority of the house, there have been no occurrences, Jessica’s
visit would</B>
<BR><B>be unmolested by the terror that had been haunting them.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the dinner table things started off well.&nbsp;
They almost made it through</B>
<BR><B>dinner without any problems, when all of a sudden the black mist
appeared.</B>
<BR><B>It floated across the room, and seemed to have gone into the mouth
of</B>
<BR><B>Jessica.&nbsp; Her eyes turned black, and she stood up straight
for the first time</B>
<BR><B>in her life.&nbsp; She leaped across the table and began to choke
Uncle Rich.&nbsp; It</B>
<BR><B>was impossible for Jessica to achieve such a feat of strength.&nbsp;
Finally,</B>
<BR><B>Jessica released her grip from my uncle’s throat and fell to the
floor.&nbsp; Her</B>
<BR><B>eyes cleared up, and she began to cough.&nbsp; The black mist came
out of her</B>
<BR><B>mouth, and floated into the basement.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My aunt and uncle decided to move from the house.&nbsp;
They left the next</B>
<BR><B>week, and warned the Realter to get the basement blessed before
they sold the</B>
<BR><B>house.&nbsp; The house still stands with no human occupants.&nbsp;
No priest will bless</B>
<BR><B>the basement, and the Realty Company will not sell the house, until
it is</B>
<BR><B>deemed safe.&nbsp; Now the whole town knows of the Horror of Druid
Hill, and every</B>
<BR><B>now and then you will hear stories of brave kids who enter the house
on a</B>
<BR><B>dare and never come back.</B><B></B>

<P><B>The Brewery Ghost</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>By: Anonymous</B><B></B>

<P><B>I mentioned in an earlier e-mail that I remain a sceptic when it
comes to ghosts,&nbsp; because I have never knowingly seen one,&nbsp; although
I have had a few strange experiences.&nbsp; I do find the stories on your
site fascinating and you may find my experiences interesting. The decision
as to whether they involve ghosts or not I will leave to the reader.</B>
<BR><B>When I was an impoverished&nbsp; student (back in 1965) I worked
during the university summer vacation at a brewery to augment my meagre
allowance.&nbsp; I remember I was paid &pound;10.00 ($28.00) a week so
if any overtime (and extra money) was available I would volunteer.</B>
<BR><B>One Thursday evening,&nbsp; an hour before the usual clocking off
time,&nbsp; the head brewer decided that the next batch of beer was ready
and would be emptied from the tun into storage.&nbsp; This meant that the
tun (the vessel in which the beer was fermented) had to be cleaned.&nbsp;
This was always done immediately because if it were left,&nbsp; the job
became much more difficult as the yeast residue would continue rising.&nbsp;
The foreman asked would I like the overtime and I prepared to clean the
tun when the last of the beer was out.&nbsp; By this time the foreman and
I were the only ones left in the building.&nbsp; I was doing the job single
handed,&nbsp; it would normally be done by two,&nbsp; so it was nearly
two hours later before I was finished.&nbsp; As I&nbsp; was finishing the
work I heard footsteps on the stair,&nbsp; which then came to the floor
where I was working.&nbsp; Thinking it was the foreman,&nbsp; I said "Nearly
finished - I'll be away soon!"&nbsp; When I said this,&nbsp; whoever was
there walked away and I heard the footsteps go back down the stairs.&nbsp;
A few minutes later I finished the work,&nbsp; cleaned up and got ready
to go home.&nbsp; I clocked out and went out by the door,&nbsp; which I
could open from the inside but which locked automatically when I closed
it.&nbsp; Once outside,&nbsp; I could not get back in without the key and
neither could any one else.</B>
<BR><B>The next morning the foreman asked me to confirm the time when I
clocked off the previous night,&nbsp;&nbsp; I told him that the time shown
on the time sheet was correct,&nbsp; "just a few minutes after I spoke
to you" I added.&nbsp; "I left soon after you started" he said "You were
in the building on your own.&nbsp; I've heard it said that there's a ghost
in the building but you're the first I've known who's heard it!"</B>
<BR><B>"Someone was here" I persisted,&nbsp; "who had the key?"</B>
<BR><B>"I did" said the foreman.&nbsp; "You were in the building on your
own."</B>
<BR><B>I still do not know what I heard,&nbsp; I relate the story as it
happened with no embellishments,&nbsp; and no,&nbsp;&nbsp; I had not been
drinking.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Sleep Paralysis</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: mickeyis@mindless.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I have sent in stories not too long ago (maybe a month or so?), but
now I am able to get further into the eerie feeling coming from the corner
of my room/closet.</B>
<BR><B>I have an old stone fireplace on the one side of my room, it's no
longer usable, but it's good decoration (I guess). A walk-in closet takes
up some of the old fireplace.... this is the area of my room I don't really
like. Every night I am sure to close my closet door tight, because if I
don't I just don't feel right.</B>
<BR><B>I have kind of had the feeling that there is a man... an older man
watching me late at night. I don't know if he wants to hurt me or not,
but I don't want to find out. I just pretend it's not there and hope for
the best.</B>
<BR><B>One night after my two basement roomies and I had declared that
we were going to be moving into a new apartment we heard a lot of what
we were sure was walking around upstairs and banging. This couldn't be
happening because our 3 roommates upstairs were home for the weekend and
no one else was there and we would have heard someone come in through the
front door or side door. I went upstairs to investigate (I'm a little gutsy
I guess) and found my one roommates door wide open even though it had been
closed.. I searched everywhere, but that was the only odd thing. That kind
of freaked us out but we were easily able to brush it off.</B>
<BR><B>So I'm still stuck here with the eerie feeling something is in the
corner of my room or in my closet. I recently moved my grandma's dresser
from my closet to just beside my bed... and ever since then weird things
have been happening.</B>
<BR><B>The need to close the closet door at night is much more intense,
but I have had my boyfriend sleeping over a lot now, so I have been keeping
calm, but something has been happening to my boyfriend now.</B>
<BR><B>Twice now he has woken to being completely paralyzed. The first
time I was with him, the second time I had gone out for a birthday drink
(just a few nights ago!).&nbsp; I came home to him being way more afraid
than the first time it happened and he was almost in tears. He told me
to close the closet door NOW (he knew of my fear but thought I was being
silly!).</B>
<BR><B>He said that he felt an older wrinkled man... greyish... was there
in the closet. When he said an old man I was shocked because&nbsp; that
is what I felt!&nbsp; Maybe it's just a coincidence.</B>
<BR><B>He's been reading about all the things the sleep paralysis could
be... but it has only happened to him at my house... and since I moved
the dresser out of the closet. I almost think my grandma's spirit was helping
to keep the closet man from bugging me... and now that it's out here it
can't help as much.</B>
<BR><B>I had also thought that maybe it was my grandfather's spirit doing
this to him... that he didn't like my boyfriend sleeping with me, but of
course wouldn't punish me for that, but instead my boyfriend. I don't think
that would be it though - I don't think grandpa would do something to scare
someone I love like that.</B>
<BR><B>I'm kind of afraid as to what to do. If there is a spirit of an
old man in my closet, I don't know whether to tell it to go to the other
side so to speak, or just hope it leaves me alone for the month and a half
I have left here.&nbsp; I feel bad for it bothering my boyfriend (if it
is)... but I'm really glad it's not me!</B>
<BR><B>If anyone has any suggestions... please feel free to email me.</B>

<P><B>Sleep Over at my Friends</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Groggyeskimo@aol.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>It was about 12 am, matt's mom had just gone to bed. We decided to
go upstairs to do something on his computer. Once we got done, we began
to search for his little brother who is usually annoying us. We found it
strange that he was not, so we figured he was up to something. We searched
the downstairs, but nothing was to be found. So we headed to his room upstairs
to check there. I figured I'd play a joke on him, so when i came to his
door, I could hear a faint noise that told me he was in there. So, following
my idea, I jumped in and yelled "boo". Nothing was in there. We both took
two more steps in the room, just listening. I said to him, "how did all
of those boxes get off the floor onto steve's bed?" It was beyond Matt
and I. I also noticed the guinea pigs' cages had been arranged differently.
This was from Matt's mom. But what happens next was not. Suddenly, a can
just slammed down to the floor, without anyone moving or touching anything.
That was the first thing to happen. We both jumped, and were just about
to run away in fear, when I tried to calm myself by making sense out of
it. "turn on the light" I said, regaining my sanity. We looked around to
find some sort of explanation for the can falling. Nothing. Not a single
thing that could've done it. No place it could have been set. We just left.
Turned out steve was in his mom's bedroom with her. We went back to matt's
room to watch a little bit of "Inuyasha, The Movie" (anime) at about 2
am. After that, I was really tired, so we went back downstairs. This was
where the second thing happened. I walked into the bathroom (possibly the
most haunted room in the house). Right before I started to pee, I heard
three little taps on the door, sounding more like little indistinct knocks.
I figured it was Matt, but it was not. I finished up, and left as fast
as i could. We watched some show on ufo's and started talking about what
ghosts are. I said "they aren't a soul, or a soul that has lost it's way,
but more like a soul's revebrations from it's past, like ripples in a pond."
Then, the third occurence happened. I couldn't help but feel this strange
paranoya. I looked over at a stuffed tiger on their couch, and boom, my
levels of paranoya and preminition flew through the roof. I could feel
its cold, black eyes, peircing into my skin, peering into my soul. I was
paralyzed with fear. I got up and walked around trying o approach it so
I could cover it with a blanket, but everywhere I went, its cold stare
followed. I couldn't get near it, even if I had wanted to. It was just
so frightening. It may sound silly, but if you were in my shoes and having
the preminitions as I was, you'd be scared shitless too. Matt covered it
for me, and shortly after that we went to sleep.</B>
<BR><B>4:00 am: Steve gets up to get some water. He hears a loud crash
but thinks nothing of it (leave it to steve). He goes back to sleep.</B>
<BR><B>8:40 am: I wake up and go home. Matt's family discovers that at
4 am, the loud noise steve heard was a from a flowered picture hanging
over the toilet in their bathroom. It had crashed to the ground, but strangely
enough, away from the toilet, when it had been hanging over the toilet.
The physics of it were purely impossible. The same thing had happened before,
too.</B>
<BR><B>The story of this house is that one day an old man was walking out
to get his mail, and died right there. We thought the hauntings had stopped,
but it looks like the revebrations have once again came to us. The ripples
in the pond, had once again reached us. My premintions we no longer superstitions.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Ellsworth Airforce Base</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Dbiznch420@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>I lived on the base at Ellsworth Airforce Base from1987-1992. During
this time we would see a large figure of a man go by us in the house. This
will sound very strange but will tell you anyway. One night my friend and
I was setting on the floor around my coffee table chatting, we both got
chill -the cross above my front door feel off, the belongings on my kitchen
table were thrown on the floor.-at the same moment my friend anne and me
looked into this large mirror-across from the mirror was a old home interior
picture( an old mailbox with a bird) and we seen an indians face with white&nbsp;
all over except black around the eyes and mouth, a mowhawk and a breast
plate looked like bones, feather in his hair in the back.&nbsp; From that
day on I could feel this presence around me, it was not a scary one but
the opposit a warm protective feeling. Our curiosity got the best of us
and we called this medicine man and asked him if we were crazy, he told
me that I was his white bird and protector and he would always be there
protecting me,.- Than to make things even stranger when trouble wad to
happen(especially around the time me and my husband were about to divorce
in the mirror a face of an old old colonal from way back would appear,
long white hair, and white beard with a hat. It got to the point I knew
ahead when something was going to happen and to be careful.&nbsp; My neighbor
across from us did not believe in spirits at all and one day she was over
and asked me who large man was that just walked up my stairs , I laughed
and told her he is my long lost soul mate my warrior, she left and never
came over again.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since than I have had different
times in life when I have needed guidiance I have felt the presence, no
face to see but feel. well that is all. Truly I am not crazy this was very
real.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Rest Haven Nursing Home</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: les.sincavage@gracocorp.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Below are a few "TRUE" stories from Rest Haven Nursing Home in Schuylkill</B>
<BR><B>Haven, PA.&nbsp; You have this place listed on your "Haunted places"
Page on your</B>
<BR><B>website.&nbsp; These stories were told to me by my mother who has
been a nurse</B>
<BR><B>there for the past 15 years.&nbsp; I hope you enjoy them and can
get some use out</B>
<BR><B>of them.&nbsp; I will keep you all posted if I hear of any more.&nbsp;
I know a few</B>
<BR><B>people that work there and everyone has a different story, but all
know the</B>
<BR><B>same.&nbsp; Believe me, there is definitely something in there.&nbsp;
And if your team</B>
<BR><B>is really up for a challenge to make a case of the place.&nbsp;
The old building</B>
<BR><B>where the haunting have occurred is no longer in use.&nbsp; So if
your team</B>
<BR><B>wanted to investigate it.&nbsp; I am sure they wouldn't mind.</B>
<BR><B>Anyway, the stories are as followed:</B>
<BR><B>Rest Haven Nursing Home in Schuylkill Haven, Pennsylvania is probably
one of</B>
<BR><B>the most haunted areas in Schuylkill County, PA.&nbsp; It was originally
an</B>
<BR><B>insane asylum in the 1800's, but was then converted into a nursing
home</B>
<BR><B>after the turn of the century.&nbsp; I have heard several stories
that had taken</B>
<BR><B>place within the walls of the old building, but I will tell you
only the</B>
<BR><B>freakiest ones.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;One story I have heard happened about 6 years ago.&nbsp; A
nurse was getting</B>
<BR><B>ready to clock out for the night when she had noticed a tall figure
standing</B>
<BR><B>in one of the rooms.&nbsp; When she went to investigate she noticed
he was</B>
<BR><B>wearing a top hat and a long dark cloche.&nbsp; Thinking he was
one of the</B>
<BR><B>patience family members she had told the man that visiting hours
were over</B>
<BR><B>and that he had to leave.&nbsp; The figure then started to walk
past the foot of</B>
<BR><B>each bed in the room and stopped at the foot of the bed furthest
from the</B>
<BR><B>nurse.&nbsp; One of the patience in the room had said to the nurse
that she (the</B>
<BR><B>woman whose bed the figure was standing in front of) could not go
to heaven</B>
<BR><B>until you leave.&nbsp; The nurse had left to clock out and walked
back to the</B>
<BR><B>room only to find that the woman who the figure was standing by
was dead.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;One night my mother was working second shift and had needed
some help from</B>
<BR><B>one of her nurses aids.&nbsp; She saw a young nurse with blond hair
walk down the</B>
<BR><B>hall into a dark room.&nbsp; My mother had called out for her as
she walked down</B>
<BR><B>the hall, but the girl would not respond.&nbsp; So my mom walked
to the room,</B>
<BR><B>turned on the light only to find the girl was not there, and there
were no</B>
<BR><B>other exists from that room.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;People would see the ghosts of monks who used to walk to halls
of the old</B>
<BR><B>asylum.&nbsp; They would always walk in groups of three.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;One story was about a huge black hand.&nbsp; One night a nurse
and a guy from</B>
<BR><B>maintenance were talking in front of a dark empty room which earlier
that</B>
<BR><B>day a patient had passed away in.&nbsp; When all of a sudden this
huge black hand</B>
<BR><B>can from the shadows of the room a reached out for the maintenance
guy.</B>
<BR><B>They both ran away not to return for the rest of the night.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;A friend of mine from High School used to work there, now
they had closed</B>
<BR><B>the old section of the building down and added an addition.&nbsp;
The old</B>
<BR><B>building is used for nothing other than storage.&nbsp; Well, my
friend was</B>
<BR><B>walking back to the old building to pick up a few blankets when
he heard</B>
<BR><B>music playing and what sounded like a gathering of people talking
in the old</B>
<BR><B>entertainment hall.&nbsp; He said when he opened the door there
was nothing in</B>
<BR><B>there except for an old wheel chair.&nbsp; He too ran out of there
not to return</B>
<BR><B>till the next day.</B>
<BR><B>One night during the winter a few of the nurses were going out behind
the</B>
<BR><B>building for a smoke break, and they said they saw the face of a
man looking</B>
<BR><B>through the window of the back door.&nbsp; They were frightened
and had the</B>
<BR><B>maintenance man go and check out the scene.&nbsp; Well, from what
they said there</B>
<BR><B>was the misty outline of the mans face still pressed against the
door window</B>
<BR><B>but absolutely no foot prints in the snow near or around the door
or</B>
<BR><B>surrounding area.&nbsp; There was no other way that they could explain
for a</B>
<BR><B>person to have left the marks on the window and get away with out
leaving</B>
<BR><B>tracks, unless he was a ghost.</B>
<BR><B>There are several other stories which most I can't recall, but the
above</B>
<BR><B>mentioned had really stuck in my head.&nbsp; So do as you will with
them.&nbsp; I hope</B>
<BR><B>you enjoy them and again they are real!!!!</B>

<P><B>My Grandmothers home, in Overland, is for surely haunted. The ghosts
are</B>
<BR><B>simply "lost souls" as she calls them.&nbsp; Many spooky accurances
have happened</B>
<BR><B>since theyve lived there.&nbsp; Many of times around 1995 a single
candle would</B>
<BR><B>simply fall from her dormant television, as if knocked carelessly
by a</B>
<BR><B>child's hand.&nbsp; Toys and rainboots would disappear</B>
<BR><B>for days. My grandmother would stand in the middle of the living
room, and</B>
<BR><B>simply say "You can play with the toys but you must return them"&nbsp;
Shed leave</B>
<BR><B>for an hour or so, and return apon finding them usually in the corner
of the</B>
<BR><B>livingroom.&nbsp; Once, my sister and cousin followed two ghost
children up to</B>
<BR><B>the attic.&nbsp; The children were unaware of their presence and
simply played as</B>
<BR><B>if it was a cozy sunday aftertoon.&nbsp; My grandmothers keys were
also playfully</B>
<BR><B>taken by the ghost children, and hidden in an unused corner of the
deepest</B>
<BR><B>closet in her home.&nbsp; The spookiest of all, in our opinions,
was definatly</B>
<BR><B>the childlike handprints on the top of the mirror. This are surely
could not</B>
<BR><B>of been reached by me, my sister, or my cousin, because simply could
not</B>
<BR><B>physically touch up approx. 6 feet up the mirror.&nbsp;&nbsp; My
grandmas house is</B>
<BR><B>very pleasent, and you would never expect ghosts to dwell... but
they are</B>
<BR><B>friendly and only want to play.</B>

<P><B>Hi my mother used to work at the Anoka metro regional treatment center
{anoka mental hospital's full name}I have seen things you would not believe
heard things you would not believe and heard things from my Mom about things
that happened there they were treated so badly there you would not believe
for one. I used to spend the night with my Mom on vail three because my
step dad would be out of town and I my Mom didn't want me to be alone well
she had me stay in one of the doctors offices at the end of the hall where
her nurses station was and about 3am I heard this noise and I looked out
the window of the office into the hallway. to my surprise I saw a young
man with a razor in one of his hands half of his head shaved walking naked
down the hall I used the phone to call my Mom and she came down and said
that there was no one there. the second time I was with her bring our used
clothes into the hospital for the patients we went into the room and I
was helping my Mom sort the clothes and we heard whistling in my ear and
my Mom was on the other side of the room. another time I was using the
nurses station bathroom and someone started knocking I told them just a
minute and they wouldn't stop when I came out there was no one there except
for my Mom and I. The only other thing I can think of is the building that
burned down and how my said she could hear people upstairs and how those
floors were closed because somone died up there and it scared the patients
soon after that they closed it and it mysteriously burned down but I never
heard her say anything about the tunnels cause she used to walked down
there for exercise in the winter but I will have to ask cause they closed
those buildings down and built a new hospital I will also attach pictures
that place is scary they should have that show fear off of MTV on there.</B>

<P><B>This is a short and sweet story. My sister and i who seem to have
some sort of extra bond were standing on a bridge near our home waiting
for a bus. The day was quite over cast and as usual buses were few and
far between. All of a sudden we were standing in what can only be described
as a desert. It was so vast, flat and empty and hot. She was there, i was
there, standing in the middle of this desolate place. Long enough to look
at each other "astonished". In a blink we were back on the bridge. We both
said "did you see that". But since, we have not really ever spoken much
about it. Almost as though we have no interest in discussing it. The weird
part about this is although i want to know more i feel as though for some
involuntary, inexplicable reason i cant dwell on this subject. Its hard
to explain but it seems to take alot of effort to remember. If it werent
that my sister was with me i would think it was a dream.</B>

<BR><B>Presence at Work</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: halotrance@mindspring.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>This website is like my second home when i'm on the internet which
is quite often.....I submitted</B>
<BR><B>a story a few years back i was 17 then,&nbsp; i am now 21... what
i want to write&nbsp; about pertains to an occurance that happened at my
workplace- i do tech support for an ISP typically i work the graveyard
shift- there's two ways you can enter/exit the building - front and back
of the building it's a pretty nice size two story building,all employees
must enter the main entrance to check in with security ... but for the
most part, for the smokers at least we use the back entrance. my cubicle
is upstairs, when i decide to take a break i have to walk downstairs the
whole back of the building has always given me the creeps i've been working
there for almost two years now - and the uneasiness i feel has always felt
the same....very strong!&nbsp; one night it was about 11: 45 i had just
gotten off a horrible call and&nbsp; went out for a break&nbsp; on my way
downstairs i did a quick run to breakroom got some coffee as i was walking
towards the stairs i kept re-playing my last call over and over in my head
each time making me more mad,as i approached the stairs i got this weird
feeling i should take the elevator which is right next to the stairs, the
feeling hit me so suddenly it stop me in my tracks i looked around debating
what i should do. the elevator is REALLY old and slow not wanting to waste
anymore of my 15 min break i dismissed this feeling and started down the
stairs i was mid-way down when all the sudden i felt an overwhelming feeling
of fear, i felt that if i didn't book it right then and there something
awful was going to happen to me,like i was going to be attacked by something.
the feeling was so strong i could about invision it happening .. i started
running down the stairs i was spilling coffee all over me it didn't even
matter all i knew was i needed to get out of there fast.. i jumped the
last five or six stairs and bolted for the door,because the back entrance
is exit only you have to press a button to let the security guard buzz
you out- because i was so scared i had forgotten this,i kept trying to
push the door open, i was frantic, i felt like whatever made me so scared
was approaching me very quickly .. finally the door opened - as soon as
i was outside i almost burst into tears i kept trying to work out what
just took place i was trying to convince myself that i was just imaging
it. i lit my cigarette and started to the front of the building..the security
on duty i saw was walking towards me i figured he was going to give me
slack about running out of&nbsp; the building like a maniac as he got closer
he had this look of concern on his face he asked me if i was alright i
almost started crying again partly because i was still scared and partly
out of embrassment we sat on a bench and he started asking me questions
why i was so scared i told him it was just my nerves i pretty much was
just trying to come up with a good lie or a rational reason for my actions
.. he then proceeded to tell me that he was watching me on the cameras
it being late and there not being alot of people there at that time and
out of boredom he confessed he said i caught his eye because as i was waiting
for the coffee i was doing a little dance.and he found it funny anyway
he said he watched me start down the stairs he said about 10 secs after
i started down the stairs the camera for the backstairwell started "malfunctioning"
and he lost feed for about 30 secs the next thing he knows he said is he
sees me running for dear-life towards the exit he couldn't understand why
i wasn't buzzing out so he opened the door for me. i stared at him in amazement.
it made me feel better in a way to think that there was something actually
there in that stairwell, and what he had just told me confirmed i didn't
act like a psyco at my employment for no reason. i avoid the back part
of the building now.. whatever i disturbed that night wasn't friendly at
all... i guess now i'm just curious if it's something i do to make it angry
at me or if it's just a mean spirit(what have you) in general..but in any
event i'm not about to find out..</B>

<P><B>Poltergeist in Idaho</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>By: timbukto2001@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>First off, I do not believe in ghosts, spirits, or u.f.o.'s. PLEASE</B>
<BR><B>LISTEN TO MY STORY!!</B>
<BR><B>Our people all came from the "pflaz" region of Germany, this in
English</B>
<BR><B>is the Palatinate. It is the region around Kaiserslautern and</B>
<BR><B>Trippstadt. We all came here between 1750-1830. All were farm people.</B>
<BR><B>When I was a child, my mother would pour a bowl of hot soup for
my twin</B>
<BR><B>and I and we would ask, why our bowls would spin at the table as
it</B>
<BR><B>cooled. We were told that it was only a poltergeist and do not worry!</B>
<BR><B>Years later, after we had saw the spinning bowls, every time we
had</B>
<BR><B>soup, we asked what is a poltergeist? My mother and father both
said,</B>
<BR><B>they are little guys that live in the dirt in-between the shingles
on</B>
<BR><B>top of your house. The idea put forth in the article about poltern's
is</B>
<BR><B>not the same as we learned as children and later life.</B>
<BR><B>Poltergeist like to visit small kids, as they are fun to play with,
easy</B>
<BR><B>to fool and have a limited amout of pre-adult (knowledge), ANY SEX,</B>
<BR><B>until they start to grow up.</B>
<BR><B>When I left home and had married another Palatinate, we hade a baby
boy.</B>
<BR><B>When he was just weeks&nbsp; and months old, we would get up in
the night to</B>
<BR><B>find his bedroom light on, crib empty and him playing on the floor.
This</B>
<BR><B>happened many several times in the first 3 years or more. My wife
and I</B>
<BR><B>saw apples rise out of paper sacks on the dining room floor, up
3 to 4</B>
<BR><B>inches from the top, and roll about. We have saw her purse move
off the</B>
<BR><B>back of a chair , about 3 inches, stay in that place for a second,
then</B>
<BR><B>drop. My mother had a coffee pot that would cry, moan, scream, groan
as</B>
<BR><B>it heated. Ah, yes, it is the poltergeist!!!</B>
<BR><B>My weak minded neighbor came over as the happenings came to a peak.
We</B>
<BR><B>told her what was going on in a ,OH WELL, TYPE ATTITUDE. She went</B>
<BR><B>nuts!!! Told us point blank, in our own house to keep them away
from</B>
<BR><B>her!!!! That is the worst thing to do in front a poltern, as the
next</B>
<BR><B>day she came over crying, off the very deepest end of sanity!!!
Darn</B>
<BR><B>thing would not let her out of her garage. Every time she would
open the</B>
<BR><B>door, it would close everytime she started to back out!</B>
<BR><B>P.S., these little guys take small items you need at a time you
really</B>
<BR><B>need them. I would bet we have 70 pairs of nail clippers, somewhere?
We</B>
<BR><B>do not have packrats in this area, lots of very small earthquakes,</B>
<BR><B>(nothing to cause a movement of a purse, etc.)</B>
<BR><B>Poltergeist has moved on in the last couple of years. We kind'a
miss</B>
<BR><B>him!</B>
<BR><B>When a door or window,shower curtain moves to you or opens, the
correct</B>
<BR><B>greeting is WELCOME, in english or I guess any other???</B>
<BR><B>Poltergeist has left, I think, ever since our kid has become a teen
and</B>
<BR><B>I really don't blame IT!!</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Plantation Post Mistress</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: okibalogs@topaz.ocn.ne.jp</B><B></B>

<P><B>This story is no where near as interesting as the others here, but
it was enough to give me chills as I stood in that room in a moment of
realization.</B>
<BR><B>I didn't see the ghost, but here's how it goes:</B>
<BR><B>I mentioned to a co-worker of mine that I was thinking about volunteering
at a local living history site as a docent. It's an old plantation house
and grounds dating back to the late 1700s. Made into a museum in the 1970s,
I believe.</B>
<BR><B>He's about 45 now, and he replied that he had a story about that
place and he refuses to ever go back again. He said that when he was a
boy, the place was in bad repair and was not a museum as yet.&nbsp; A friend
of his uncle's owned or rented the place, I'm not exactly sure, but used
it as a storehouse, for junk, pretty much. He said that he had accompanied
his uncle and the friend to this house to get something.&nbsp; He said
they left him downstairs in one of the front rooms while they went upstairs
to retrieve whatever it was that they were looking for.&nbsp; And he said
that while he was there, the front window opened a few inches by itself.&nbsp;
He ran from the house screaming and said that later, no one believed him.</B>
<BR><B>I didn't believe him either. Well, I believed he believed what he
saw, but I didn't believe in ghosts at the time and figured there was some
logical explanation.&nbsp; For example, there's another old house open
to tours in town that has a weight and pulley system on the windows because
they're so heavy and the weights make the opening a little easier.&nbsp;
I figured, you never know with these old houses and deterioration if something's
going to screw up or just act funny on you or something.&nbsp; Maybe this
house had the same set up on its windows.</B>
<BR><B>Well, a week or so later I went to this house and started training
to become a docent.&nbsp; A little old lady took me through the house before
opening hours to teach me what was to be said and pointed out and all.&nbsp;
We started in the front parlour, back to the family room, over to the dining
room and then up to the front office room (directly across the hall from
the parlour). It was in this office that the old woman told me that this
room was used for buisness matters relating to the inner workings of the
plantation and later as a post office because the lady of the house served
as post mistress for a time. Folks would come up onto the front porch and
she would open the window a few inches and hand them their mail through
that space.</B>
<BR><B>I stopped her, laughing nervously, apologised, and told her what
my co-worker had told me about his visit long ago.&nbsp; She had no response
at all! It was the strangest thing, she smiled, nodded, then turned her
back and continued the tour, no comment whatsoever!</B>
<BR><B>Oh, and no, there's no weight and pulley system on these big ol'
windows.</B>
<BR><B>When I got back to work the next day I asked my co-worker if he
had ever been there since it was made into a museum.&nbsp; He said no,
he didn't ever want to go there again. I asked him which front room had
the incident occured in? He said standing on the porch, facing the windows,
the room on the left.&nbsp; Which is the office.&nbsp; So I told him what
I learned on my tour.&nbsp; Why do I believe him? Two reasons: he's not
a history buff, I really can't see him ever wanting to visit a historical
site anyway. Also, he's incredibly religous, almost fanatically so. He
wouldn't make up a story like that.&nbsp; So that's that.&nbsp; I guess
the old post mistress is still trying to hand out the mail!</B><B></B>

<P><B>Personal Experience</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: s.kieran@faulkner.co.nz</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>I grew up in a house that was haunted and most probabally still is.</B>
<BR><B>The only thing I know about the house is it is around 120 years
old and was</B>
<BR><B>owned once by an old lady with her son.</B>
<BR><B>We would all feel a presence standing over us at night while we
were in bed,</B>
<BR><B>or at certain times are names would be whispered into our ears very
fast and</B>
<BR><B>quite suddenly.</B>
<BR><B>The sounds of balls bouncing down the hallway were common or footsteps</B>
<BR><B>accompanied by whistling.</B>
<BR><B>A shadow would pass or flit very quickly past our dinning room door
( while</B>
<BR><B>we had the door closed) we could see this shadow moving past under
the crack</B>
<BR><B>of the door.</B>
<BR><B>I actually saw the whole shadow once - and I'm positive it was a
man shadow.</B>
<BR><B>It used to imitate my dad walking down the hallway - exactly the
same type</B>
<BR><B>of walk, right down to the little shuffle he would do in his slippers!</B>
<BR><B>As I would be getting off to sleep, a small animal, maybe a dog
would</B>
<BR><B>suddenly jump up onto my bed right across my legs - but of course
nothing</B>
<BR><B>would be there.</B>
<BR><B>Other times it would "hide" objects from us, like hair brushes,
toys etc etc</B>
<BR><B>only to find them in the same place where we knew we left them the
following</B>
<BR><B>day.</B>
<BR><B>It spoke twice to my mother - but not directly to her.</B>
<BR><B>A woman's voice like an echo sound asked "where are the suitcases?
"</B>
<BR><B>and then at another time she asked for "Bob?"</B>
<BR><B>Another time the ghost obviously liked my mothers perfume as my
mother was</B>
<BR><B>alone one day and walked into her room and smelled freshly sprayed
perfume -</B>
<BR><B>the bottle was completely empty.</B>
<BR><B>I don't feel that this presence ( or however many ) was evil - maybe
a</B>
<BR><B>little mischeivous at times, but that's all.</B>
<BR><B>Still, I would be quite pertrified at times - especially in my teens.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Parnormal Experiences</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Jennifer702@aol.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hello. My names Jennifer and I live in San Diego,
CA.&nbsp; I have had many</B>
<BR><B>paranormal experiences.&nbsp; I would take too long to tell all
of them, so I'll</B>
<BR><B>just tell a couple.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One night, when i was little i shared a room
with my brother.&nbsp; My brother</B>
<BR><B>was fast asleep and i couldnt sleep.&nbsp; I just lied in my bed,
because i</B>
<BR><B>couldnt go to sleep without my my little pony stuffed animal.&nbsp;
I got up my</B>
<BR><B>courage and walked up to the closet to get my stuffed animal.&nbsp;
As soon as i</B>
<BR><B>open the closet door... I saw two big red eyes just floating there
staring at</B>
<BR><B>me...I screamed and thought it was a nightmare .. but when i jumped
on my</B>
<BR><B>brother, he woke up and i realized it wasnt a dream. Soon after
that my mom</B>
<BR><B>came in and flicked on the lights and was wondering what happened.
I told her</B>
<BR><B>and she said just go back to sleep.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About a year or two ago, I went to my uncle's
funeral.&nbsp; It was a clear,</B>
<BR><B>sunny day.. and my mom and I were driving to the cemetery.&nbsp;
I was sad but I</B>
<BR><B>was in a normal state of mind.&nbsp; My mom was talking to me ..
and as soon as we</B>
<BR><B>drove past the entrance gate to the cemetery... it was as if someone
clapped</B>
<BR><B>their hands over my ears, or like I was under water.. my mom's voice
was</B>
<BR><B>slowly drowned out and i heard silence then I heard someone whispering.
I was</B>
<BR><B>sooo weird.&nbsp; The whisper sounded very faint, but the person
was whispering a</B>
<BR><B>name that sounded french or something.&nbsp; The whispering voice
had an accent..</B>
<BR><B>not from another country.. but from an earlier era in time..</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once when i was at the beach at night time with
my brother and another</B>
<BR><B>friend, I looked out the car window (which was parked) and i saw&nbsp;
a young</B>
<BR><B>person with long brown hair , a white long sleeve shirt, and long
white pants</B>
<BR><B>sitting indian stlye on the floor ..in the dirt facing me .. next
to the car.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;I thought that it was strange for him to be facing our car
and not the</B>
<BR><B>beautiful ocean .. so i glanced back a milasecond later and he was
gone.</B>
<BR><B>Nobody sitting in the position could have got up and ran away that
quick and</B>
<BR><B>even if they did .. it was an open space and theyd have nowhere
to hide.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another time when I was about 10 years old...
I opened the kitchen</B>
<BR><B>cabinet and a glass flew out .. hit the floor, and shattered.&nbsp;
I thought that</B>
<BR><B>was strange because it flew out a couple seconds after i already
opened the</B>
<BR><B>cabinet and with force.&nbsp; I didn't feel threatend though.&nbsp;
I searched the</B>
<BR><B>cabinet for an explination.. like mice or roaches, but i found nothing.&nbsp;
Now</B>
<BR><B>that i look back i think i was a spirit trying to give me a message.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another time when i was in highschool.&nbsp;
I slept in the living room</B>
<BR><B>because i didnt have a bedroom.&nbsp; I saw someone that looked
like my mom's</B>
<BR><B>fiance (now husband) walk into the kitchen.&nbsp; I thought that
it was him.. but</B>
<BR><B>after a couple of minutes .. i didnt hear any noises from the kitchen..</B>
<BR><B>Usually if someone goes into the kitchen they open the refridgerator
or get</B>
<BR><B>water or something...since i didnt hear anything i walk into the
kitchen and</B>
<BR><B>it was empty.&nbsp; We lived in a thrid story apartment at the time
and there were</B>
<BR><B>no doors in the kitchen.. so whoever I saw go in the kitchen couldnt
have</B>
<BR><B>left the kitchen.&nbsp; Later i told my mom that and she said that
her fiance</B>
<BR><B>looked just like her cousin that was murdered..and that she had
a dream about</B>
<BR><B>him around the time before, i saw someone that looked like him,
walk into the</B>
<BR><B>kitchen.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I never felt threatened except for the red eyes.&nbsp;
Usually these</B>
<BR><B>paranormal experiences happen so randomly and so quick you dont
have time to</B>
<BR><B>be scared until u think about it after it happens.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Our Max</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: toshorty@msn.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>My name is Amy, and For some reason, spirits and ghosts are drawn
to me.I've</B>
<BR><B>lived in atleast three houses that had "special friends" in them.
The most</B>
<BR><B>recent was about 5 years ago. My husband, myself and our 14 month
old son</B>
<BR><B>found a townhouse in our price range and area. I was 8 months pregnant
with</B>
<BR><B>our other son. At first we had no problems, but soon after our son
was born,</B>
<BR><B>it all started. We had a stair case that was iron bars, so we could
see the</B>
<BR><B>wall behind it. a little boy sat there a lot of the time, staring
at the</B>
<BR><B>wall. He would not let us see his face at all. He "told" me that
his name</B>
<BR><B>was Max.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; A friend of a friend came over one night, she froze in the
door way. She</B>
<BR><B>described Max to the tee. He always wore one of two outfits, both
80's style</B>
<BR><B>clothes. He had a long style bowl cut with sandy blonde hair. But
of course</B>
<BR><B>he stared at the wall for her to. She took a tour of our house and
she felt</B>
<BR><B>he was hurt in the bathroom, I felt it happened in the master bedroom,
for</B>
<BR><B>three reasons. One, the foul smell that came from a corner, but
only</B>
<BR><B>sometimes. It smelled of rotting oranges, sweet but rotten. Two
was that</B>
<BR><B>when our younger son was about 6-8 weeks old, he went into a panic
attack</B>
<BR><B>and would not stop until we left the room. After that, he was not
able to</B>
<BR><B>cross the threshhold of the door way. Three was that the friend
that saw Max</B>
<BR><B>spent the night in our room, was given a big hug by him, she never
spent the</B>
<BR><B>night again.</B>
<BR><B>We all slept in the living room, for obvious reasons. One night
my</B>
<BR><B>step-brother slept over. While we talked at 3am my potted ivey next
to the</B>
<BR><B>stairs swong back and forth, no windows open or anything.</B>
<BR><B>Max liked to play with the boys toys, and watch tv when we were
gone.</B>
<BR><B>Although Max could be annoying, he never hurt us.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Once a Hotel</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Luv2LuvMe79@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Okay...I've had several experiences, but his one is the coolest....literally.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In the house that I just moved out of a few days ago, I always felt things
around.&nbsp; A woman (mostly in the kitchen), and a man (in the bathroom).&nbsp;
The woman never got too close, but hung around.&nbsp; No biggie.&nbsp;
The man on the other hand, scared the crap out of me.&nbsp;&nbsp; One time,
I was hanging my head over the bathtub to wash my hair and I could feel
him wandering around.&nbsp;&nbsp; (This is winter, so take note that no
windows are left open).&nbsp;&nbsp; From the time it took me to get my
hair wet and put shampoo in my hands, my hair was ice cold.&nbsp;&nbsp;
And not like there was a small draft in the room either.&nbsp;&nbsp; Like
I had stuck my wet hair in the freezer, cold.&nbsp;&nbsp; Interesting....&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I would also get very uneasy when he got too close.&nbsp;&nbsp; I called
my fiance home from the neighbors house on several occasions because I
was terrified.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last note;&nbsp;&nbsp; The apartment used
to be an old motel.&nbsp; So think about all the people that have gone
through my door.&nbsp;&nbsp; And think about all the bad things that could
have happened in there.&nbsp;&nbsp; An intimidating man and a sweet shy
woman.&nbsp;&nbsp; Makes me wonder.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>&nbsp;New Platz, NY</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:authette@netscape.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>I just found your web site and find it fascinating! I lived in the
same</B>
<BR><B>house for 44 years in New Paltz, New York. I am convinced there
are spirits</B>
<BR><B>in that house. Here are a few stories.</B>
<BR><B>I always had a very uncomfortable feeling about a particular room
in the</B>
<BR><B>house. I was less than 3 years old when my grandfather took an overdose
of a</B>
<BR><B>diabetes medication, Diabinese. It had just come out. He took about
60 pills</B>
<BR><B>in an hour because he forgot he took them. My mother found him unconscious</B>
<BR><B>in that room. He died a few days later because when they pumped
his stomach,</B>
<BR><B>an ulcer ruptured and he bled to death.</B>
<BR><B>My father was ill for 8 years with a neurological disease, Steele-Richardson</B>
<BR><B>Syndrome. The VA provided a hospital bed when he was home. He was
in that</B>
<BR><B>room. Several years later, my sister was ill with cancer. She was
in that</B>
<BR><B>room and died in that bed.</B>
<BR><B>A year later, my mother, who was also ill with cancer, was in that
room. She</B>
<BR><B>died in that bed.</B>
<BR><B>I kept hearing noises in the house. I would be downstairs and the
only one</B>
<BR><B>home. I could hear movement upstairs like someone else was there.</B>
<BR><B>My mother and I had a habit of watching the 11:00 news and then
going to</B>
<BR><B>bed. One night, I was on one side of the living room and got up
to turn off</B>
<BR><B>the tv at 11:30. I saw a small circle of light at the bottom of
the tv</B>
<BR><B>stand. When I got to the tv, it was as if an invisible wall went
up. I was</B>
<BR><B>only about 2-3 inches from the tv knobs, but until that light went
away, I</B>
<BR><B>could not reach them. It must have been my mother. A few days earlier,
my</B>
<BR><B>friend and I were sitting in the living room across from each other
talking.</B>
<BR><B>All of a sudden he got a strange look on his face. He saw a small
ball of</B>
<BR><B>light move just off the floor near the fireplace and other side
of the room,</B>
<BR><B>and then disappear.</B>
<BR><B>About 2 years befor my sister died, she went on a Tres Dias weekend
and got</B>
<BR><B>a cross. It was on one of her dressers in my brother's room. I had
a tennant</B>
<BR><B>in my sister's room. He thought he heard someone come in earlier,
but was</B>
<BR><B>not sure. The house was on the market and repairs were being made.&nbsp;
We went</B>
<BR><B>upstairs and I instinctively flipped the switch to turn the light
on</B>
<BR><B>in the room. The light went on, so we realized it had been the repairman.
My</B>
<BR><B>tenant noticed the cross and suggested we bring it downstairs.</B>
<BR><B>I took his advise and hung it on the mirror on the opposite wall
of the</B>
<BR><B>death room. That cross moved for 4 hours non stop that night! Sometimes
it</B>
<BR><B>would move up and down like on a heartbeat. Sometimes it would move
side to</B>
<BR><B>side, like a pendulum. That cross still moves to this day! I took
it with me</B>
<BR><B>when I moved to Colorado three and a half years ago. It has nothing
to do</B>
<BR><B>with any kind of draft, open window, etc. I firmly believe my sister
is</B>
<BR><B>still with me.</B>
<BR><B>Also ghost related is the story of my father. He died Februry 18,
1981. It</B>
<BR><B>rained the day of his funeral. It rained on the way to the Funeral
Home. It</B>
<BR><B>stopped so we could go inside. It rained while we were inside. It
stopped so</B>
<BR><B>we could come out. It rained on the way to the Church. It stopped
so we</B>
<BR><B>could go inside. It poured like no tomarrow all through Mass. It
stopped so</B>
<BR><B>we could come out. It rained on the way to the Cemetary. It stopped
when we</B>
<BR><B>got there. It started again when we left. From that day on, till
I moved in</B>
<BR><B>1999, if I went to the Cemetary in the rain, it would rain on the
way up,</B>
<BR><B>stop while I was there, and start again when I left. My girlfriend
witnessed</B>
<BR><B>this one night and it freaked her out. She thought I was joking.</B>
<BR><B>Here is a story about my mother. She always promised me she would
come back</B>
<BR><B>and help me if she could after she died. Well, she died on a Wednesday</B>
<BR><B>morning. I had to drive to Northern New Jersey Thursday night to
pick up my</B>
<BR><B>brother and sister-in-law for the funeral. I forgot to gas up on
the way out</B>
<BR><B>of New Jersey. I looked at my gas gauge after I passed the rest
stop between</B>
<BR><B>the Newburgh exit and the New Paltz exit on the New York State Thruway.
I</B>
<BR><B>had less than an eighth of a tank of gas. I asked mom to get me
home. I hit</B>
<BR><B>empty about 2-3 miles before the exit. I pulled into the gas station
across</B>
<BR><B>from the exit on fumes. To this day, I have not run out of gas.
I do not</B>
<BR><B>make it a habit of waiting till I am empty to fill up. I believe
she is</B>
<BR><B>still with me, and watching over me.</B>
<BR><B>After the death of my sister and my mother, I was devistated. I
tried</B>
<BR><B>suicide. I took some pills and put a frozen solid piece of London
Broil and</B>
<BR><B>tomato sauce on the gas stove. I checked it after about an hour
and found it</B>
<BR><B>had not cooked much. I took some more pills and decided to turn
it off in an</B>
<BR><B>hour. I woke up for work 10 hours later. When I lifted the lid,
it was</B>
<BR><B>charcoal. The gas was off. The next day, my supervisor told me my
mother had</B>
<BR><B>come to her and said she came down and turned off the gas so nothing
would</B>
<BR><B>happen to me.</B>

<P><B>Nashville Apartment</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:ecohea@hccaintl.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I must say I am very impressed with this website!!&nbsp; Great work!!</B>
<BR><B>I have an experience (or few) to share.&nbsp; In November of 1994,
I moved into an upstairs apartment of an old house that was built in the
1930s or possibly before in the historic part of Nashville.&nbsp; My first
night in the apartment is actually when I had my first strange experience.&nbsp;
I was waiting for my boyfriend Chris to get home from work.&nbsp; It was
about 9pm when I was in the bedroom with the door closed getting things
unpacked and organized.&nbsp; I heard a slight knock on the door and thought
maybe Chris was playing a prank on me.&nbsp; So I just ignored it hoping
that he'd give up the game and enter the bedroom.&nbsp; Well, he never
opened the door so I listened carefully to see if he was walking around
in the other rooms.&nbsp; All of a sudden I heard talking in the living
room which was directly across the hall from our bedroom.&nbsp; I opened
the door to find a glow coming out of the dark living room.&nbsp; As I
walked into the room I started feeling really uneasy.&nbsp; It was the
television.&nbsp; It somehow got turned on. It was not on before as I turned
off every form of electricity in the rest of the house but the bedroom
light.&nbsp; So I switched on the living room overhead light in a flash
and walked into the room to investigate.&nbsp; Nothing out of the ordinary...&nbsp;
so I started to walk toward the television to turn it off and before I
could touch the knob, it turned off on its own, right before my eyes.&nbsp;
I ran into the bedroom and waited for Chris to come home.&nbsp; Finally
he did and did not believe one word of my experience.</B>
<BR><B>My other experiences came a few years later after Chris and I had
broken up and I was living in the apartment by myself.&nbsp; Every once
in a while as I would be almost asleep, something would hit my bedroom
door very hard.&nbsp; It sounded like a gunshot it was so sharp and loud.&nbsp;
Needless to say, I would jolt upright in the bed and sleep with my lights
on the rest of the night.&nbsp; Another night I woke up to my music box
on my dresser playing.&nbsp; Another boyfriend of mine, while I was asleep
one night claimed to hear footsteps outside the bedroom door going down
the hallway.&nbsp; He also said he woke up one night and had something
(or some force) hovering over him and made it known to him that it was
angry and wanted him or us out.&nbsp; I spent 7 years in that apartment
but only had those moments.</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp; My Parents House is Haunted</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: sean743@juno.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>This may seem far fetched, but just about every place I've lived
in has been haunted. A coworker once told me that I might be a portal for
spirts due to the number of experiences I've had.</B>
<BR><B>I'll share my parent's current house with you. Hope I don't make
it sound too formal...</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; a.. House was originally built in the late 1970's.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; b.. My parents being the second owners; original owners were
in their 70's or 80's, but only used the house as a weekend getaway and
sold to my parent's in March of 1988.</B>
<BR><B>A few of the instances:</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp; a.. First instance was in 1991. A friend of mine was staying
the night and came running into the bathroom where I was. He was completely
agitated and was rattling on about a green light, the size of a dime, come
out the north wall, zinged about the room and went back into the wall.
We backtracked and repeated our movements of the previous five minutes,
but to no prevail.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; b.. One week later, I was in bed and saw the green light
dash about the room. I said to the light "About time you showed yourself
to me", ironically, I swear on a stack of Bibles, the light flung itself
back into the north wall and the window rattled like a fist had hit it.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; c.. For about a month afterward, shadows moved across the
room; the verticle blinds would shake,as if someone was standing there
shaking them violently; the TV would glow as if being turned on or off
(even when I had it unplugged); then the SCARIEST thing happened in that
room...my bed which was an old&nbsp; king size oak&nbsp; waterbed that
was converted to a regular bed lifted off the ground with me in it and
slowly swayed. The bed did this three nights in a row. Needless to say,
I was too scared to get out of the bed, call out, or anything. The bed
didn't lift high, about an inch, but I actually felt it lift and sway.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; d.. Various events happened over the years...way too many
to put in an e-mail.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; e.. In Jan 1998, when my mother passed away, our former maid
swore she saw my mother on the TV waving goodbye. Our&nbsp; former maid
was a religious lady who would not make this type of stuff&nbsp; up. Also,
after talking to her, I determined that the moment she saw my mother on
TV was the precise moment I had the unfortunancy of watching my mother
die at the hospital.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; f.. Right after my mother died, I noticed a lot of cold spots
when I would visit my father on the weekends. Also, our dog would jump
up, perk her ears, cock her head, and just stare into the hallway. It was
too weird. Also, I always felt like I was being watched.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; g.. In the few years since my mother passed, I still feel
the cold spots, see lights and movement, items have been known to disappear
and then reappear in the same place that was previously searched.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; h.. My father's lady friend has had similar experiences.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; i.. My father must have witnessed things too, for I have
asked him about it and he quickly changes the topic.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; j.. Ironically, on the one year anniversary of my mother's
death, a friend and I were house sitting for my dad. My friend swears that
a blue orb about the size of a beach ball came out of the back bedroom
closet and hovered over the bed. Also, on the same night, he woke up and
saw a small man standing by the bed with a really evil look; ironically,
I woke up about that time because the dog was outside the room barking
like mad and trying to get into the room.</B>
<BR><B>There's a lot more to this story. Also, this is not the only haunted
place I've been in. I've got stories that would fill a library.</B>
<BR><B>Feel free to write, if you would like more of my "adventures".</B><B></B>

<BR><B>My Paps White Cat</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: BadHdGrl@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I have only had two experiences with strange happenings. I have shared
one now I would like to share the second.</B>
<BR><B>Growing up, my Pap and I were very close. I spent a lot of weekends
with him and grandma. Even tho there were 20 plus grandkids I was always
closest to my Pap. Pap worked on a farm and one day he brought home a kitten.
He was beautiful!! He was pure white and he had one green eye and one blue.
We named him Fluffy and for years he was Paps outside cat. One day he just
dissappeared. Now I realize he ran away but at the time I was broken hearted.
That was 28 years ago.</B>
<BR><B>Pap passed away 11 years ago, and before he passed he told me that
he would always take time to keep an eye on me and my kids. By a&nbsp;
strange twist of fate my husband started working on the same farm the year
after Pap passed. It was a job, nothing fancy but it paid the bills for
us. The farmer supplied the housing for us and he put us on the same plot
of ground that my Pap had lived 28 years ago.</B>
<BR><B>Life went on, and financial problems hit. I was really down one
day and looked out the window and on my porch sat a pure white cat. I was
thinking to myself that this can't be. So I opened the door and called
"Fluffy?"...as the cat turned there was the one blue and one green eye.
I knew right away that it was Pap looking after me. I sat for hours on
the porch with Fluffy. Talking to him as if I was talking to a person.
Afterwards I felt calm and sure that everything would work out for us.
And sure enough I secured a good job and things were going good. Anytime
I was feeling blue or down, I would look out the window and the Cat would
be sitting at the door waiting for me. This went on for 5 years. Fluffy
was never around any other time tho. I would go looking for him, just too
see if he was real. But I was never able to find him. But just like Pap
I knew he would be there when I needed him. My girls and husband never
saw the cat, and they would often joke it was my imagination. But I know
what I saw.</B>
<BR><B>We moved from the farm a year ago. My husband took a job that paid
him double his pay from there. We took a whole weekend to move, with many
to and from trips. On Monday I went to clean the house and make sure all
loose ends were tied up. As I pulled in the lane, out of nowhere popped
Fluffy to meet me. He sat on the porch while I finished up, and as i closed
the door to that chapter of my life, Fluffy rubbed up against my leg.I
bent down and patted his head and said a goodbye to him. His tail went
up in the air, he meowed real loud and sorta sauntered across the yard.
I guess that was his way of saying you will be fine. The last year here
has been all good and I still sit and think about Fluffy/Pap. I know it
was Pap watching over me during our hard times. And I still wonder what
the odds are of me getting down and looking out the window and seeing Fluffy
on my deck.</B>

<BR><B>My Haunted House in England</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: SweetHart238@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>I used to live in a house that was built in the 1600's.&nbsp; At
one time, part of the civil war had occured right behind my house. Now
I am not a very strong believer&nbsp; in ghosts or anything like that,
but the things that would happen in my house were very strange. I always
heated my house so it was very warm. But one day, I was walking up the
stairs, and I all of the sudden felt a cold draft that felt like ice run
past me.</B>
<BR><B>I had a very big fireplace in my house. It was so big, that it even
had shelves on it! Well, I put things on those shelves and for instance,
one time I put a clock on my shelf and&nbsp; I would go to bed, and the
when I woke up I would go and look at the clock and it the back would be
facing the other way! Something had to turn it around, because noone else
lived in that house with me, and clocks don't just turn around by themselves.</B>
<BR><B>There was also another part of my house which was built in the 1800's.
The strange thing is that nothing ever happened in that part of the house.
It was only int he part of the house that was there during the civil war.
But like I said, I do not believe very much in this whole ghost business,
but something had to be there to do that stuff...</B><B></B>

<P><B>My Grandfather's Ring</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: reggaerat79@hotmail.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>I'm not sure if this counts as a 'ghost story' or if it was just</B>
<BR><B>coincidence.&nbsp; This is not my experience, but my father's.</B>
<BR><B>When my grandfather from my father's side died back in the summer
of '97, my</B>
<BR><B>dad got his gold and ruby ring.&nbsp; My dad wore that ring all
the time except</B>
<BR><B>when he took a shower and went to bed.&nbsp; A year or so ago, the
ring went</B>
<BR><B>missing.&nbsp; I vaguely remember my father asking us all if we
had seen the</B>
<BR><B>ring.&nbsp; Needless to say, he was pretty upset that he could not
find it.</B>
<BR><B>About two or three weeks ago, my dad came up to us and showed us
the ring.</B>
<BR><B>He said to us, "You know how long this ring has been missing?&nbsp;
More than a</B>
<BR><B>year.&nbsp; Almost two."&nbsp; We, his children, asked him how and
where he found it,</B>
<BR><B>after so long.&nbsp; He proceeded to tell us the following.</B>
<BR><B>Earlier that morning, while he was still asleep, he had had a dream.&nbsp;
His</B>
<BR><B>father had come to him in the dream.&nbsp; He asked him where his
ring was and my</B>
<BR><B>dad told him that it was gone.&nbsp; My grandfather said that it
was not.&nbsp; And my</B>
<BR><B>father told him that, yes, unfortunately he had lost it several
years ago.</B>
<BR><B>My grandfather reprimanded him for losing the ring, but told him
that he (my</B>
<BR><B>father) had, infact, not lost it; that my father knew exactly where
it was.</B>
<BR><B>My dad told him that he did not know where it was.&nbsp; My grandfather
told him</B>
<BR><B>that it was in the dresser, way in the bottom, that it had slipped
out of</B>
<BR><B>the drawer into the dresser that day that he lost it.</B>
<BR><B>My father awoke from the dream and decided to check the dresser
and see.&nbsp; He</B>
<BR><B>took out the three drawers and there, in the corner of the dresser
bottom,</B>
<BR><B>was the gold and ruby ring that belonged to my grandfather.</B>
<BR><B>Coincidence or did my grandfather really visit my father through
a dream and</B>
<BR><B>help him find that ring?</B>

<P><B>MY Fathers Home in the Canyon</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: cutie_102@hotmail.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>Hi, my name is Jess, and from 1998 to 2000, my father lived in a
tiny house</B>
<BR><B>at the bottom of a canyon in Crosbyton, Texas. In this canyon, there
are two</B>
<BR><B>other houses, but they are both on the other side of the caprock
and we</B>
<BR><B>hadn't ever really met them, other than a chat while my fater and
I</B>
<BR><B>occasionaly rode our horses past (Crosbyton is an old, run down
ranch town</B>
<BR><B>where there aren't a whole lot of people). Anyway, when my father
was</B>
<BR><B>showering one morning alone, he claimed he heard someone calling
his name.</B>
<BR><B>Thinking it was my aunt who lived down the road about 7 miles, he
quickly</B>
<BR><B>dressed and went out to look for her. He called her name, and when
there was</B>
<BR><B>no reply, he assumed she had returned home. About 10 minutes, he
called my</B>
<BR><B>aunt, and when she picked up the phone, she had been asleep! While
in that</B>
<BR><B>house, my sister was less than a year old when they moved in. She
would lay</B>
<BR><B>in her crib and smile and laugh when my stepmom would be sewing
or</B>
<BR><B>something. When she walked over to see what Emmy (my sister) was
excited</B>
<BR><B>about, she saw Emmy watching something dash from one side of the
ceiling to</B>
<BR><B>the other. While on my grandparents ranch (also in Crosbyton- the
L7 Ranch)</B>
<BR><B>my father took his old horse Dudley out in to an isolated pasture
that my</B>
<BR><B>Grandpa didn't use much. As he entered the pasture, Dudley, who
by nature is</B>
<BR><B>a very calm horse, went wild. There was absolutely no way that horse
was</B>
<BR><B>going to go inside the pasture. Wondering what was wrong with Dudley,
my Dad</B>
<BR><B>dismounted and checked his hooves for something that might have
hurt him.</B>
<BR><B>There was nothing. He finally got dudley calmed down, but as soon
as he</B>
<BR><B>mounted him to try to get him inside the pasture, my father heard
the faint</B>
<BR><B>crying of a baby. When he realized there wasn't a living person
within a</B>
<BR><B>mile's radius, my father and the quite shaken horse got out of there
as fast</B>
<BR><B>as he could. Later on, they discovered many Comanche grave sites
that</B>
<BR><B>haven't been touched in over fifty years, as the ranch has owned
that land</B>
<BR><B>for quite some time. In those graves, they discovered a chief, a
few men,</B>
<BR><B>and, in one grave, a tiny child no older than 3 years. To this day,
neither</B>
<BR><B>my father, nor the horses or cattle will enter or graze this sacred
pasture.</B>

<P><B>I lived with my sister throughout some of my teenage years and my
little</B>

of weeks ago</B>
<BR><B>I learned that she has seen the same ghost in the house.&nbsp; Our
descriptions</B>
<BR><B>match perfectly.</B>
<BR><B>One day I was fixing my face in the mirror and I saw the reflection
of a</B>
<BR><B>figure float by out in the hallway.&nbsp; It was a woman, gray haired
with a</B>
<BR><B>whitish silvery gown on and she seemed to float and not walk-i did
not see</B>
<BR><B>the image of feet taking steps.&nbsp; My niece described the same
thing in the</B>
<BR><B>same area but we are the only family to live in that house.&nbsp;
My</B>
<BR><B>brother-in-law who was at one time my legal guardian built that
house.</B>
<BR><B>Every time&nbsp; I stay in the house alone I sense a presence and
I hear noises.</B>

<BR><B>More Ghost Stories</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: nickie_2005@hotmial.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;I sent in some stories a couple months ago and thought it was
time to send</B>
<BR><B>In more.&nbsp; Here goes.&nbsp; My great grandma and grandpa used
to live in a little house</B>
<BR><B>Out in the middle of nowhere by a little town in Missouri no other
houses were by their</B>
<BR><B>House.&nbsp; One time my mom, her mom, and two brothers were there
and they heard a baby</B>
<BR><B>Crying my uncle was a baby at the time but he was not crying.&nbsp;
Another time I think it was probably around the same time my grandma got
up to fix my uncle a bottle when she walked in the kitchen the stove was
glowing red ( it was a gas stove not an electric) also there is this light
that had a string that you had to pull to turn it on well she was standing
under it and something was dangeling in her face the next morning she stood
under the light and there was no way the string could of dangled in front
of her face.</B>
<BR><B>There is this road in Louisiana, Missouri (it is down on the river
front)&nbsp; well my grandma and her friends would walk down it after going
to the movies and they would hear something running down the hill from
the cemetery now this is a big hill nothing could run down it well anyways
it would follow them until they got to the railroad lights.&nbsp; I have
heard other stories of this same ghost on the internet so if you have heard
any contact me.</B>
<BR><B>This is my dads ghost experience it happened last July of ’02.&nbsp;
Well he was working on my uncles heater in his basement (it is a big basement
with many rooms) he doesn’t know why exactly but he looked behind him and
saw something standing there he just turned back around and started working
again because he thought it was a brown cabinate that was standing&nbsp;
against the wall.&nbsp; Then he started thinking that it couldn’t be the
cabinate so he looked back around and it was still there looking at him.&nbsp;
He said that it was an outline of a tall man it was misty in the middle
and black around the edges.&nbsp; He said he didn’t feel a temperature
change because it was already cold in the basement but he said his hair
stood up on the back of his neck.&nbsp; After that it dispppeared and he
went back to working on the heater because he had to get it fixed.</B>
<BR><B>We used to live in a house with a cemetery in front of it now I
don’t know if it had anything to do with our experiences but ya never know.&nbsp;
My mom would stay at home during the day why we were at school well one
she heard a music box playing now we had music boxes but they did not play
that song that It was playing.&nbsp; On other days she would be sleeping
and something would shake the end of the bed.&nbsp; She would sleep on
the couch and hear something walk through the kitchen.&nbsp; I remember
some nights (I slept on the couch cuz I didn’t like my room) I would also
hear something walk through the kitchen.&nbsp; My mom also heard someone
walking in the garage my dad wasn’t home and we were at school we had a
small dog in there but these steps sounded like boots on wood but the odd
thing was our floor was concrete.</B>
<BR><B>One night at the house I live at now my cousin was sleeping on the
floor and I was on the couch it was like 3:30 Am when I felt something
peck on my knee constantly I looked up cuz sometimes my cousin sleep walks
but it is usually 30 minutes after she goes to sleep well I looked up and
she was asleep.&nbsp; The next morning I wasn’t going to tell my cousin
about it but when we were eating breakfast she told me that when she got
off the computer that same night she heard someone talking from the hall
everyone was asleep by this time it was around 1 Am well anyways she told
me that and I was shocked so I decided I better tell her about my experience.&nbsp;
Another time earlier that year I was babysitting my little cousin and my
older cousin from the story above was on the computer I was in the bathroom
doing my hair when I seen this little girl run by I thought it might be
my little cousin so I went in and asked them if she had gotten and they
said no and I figured it wasn’t her cuz she never ran back by my cousin
didn’t see it and the computer is right by where the bathroom door is.</B>
<BR><B>Well I hope you liked my stories even though it was a little long
if you want to ask me a question just email me.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Mammy and Pappy; The Ghost of my House</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: KHMBADBOY@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>I live in a very old farmhouse. The house is over 160 years old.
I personally never had anything happen to me, but my parents have had things
happen to them. My step-dad's great grandparents once lived in the house.
He told me that he swore that he saw his pappy at the top of the stairs.
My mom also says that she saw mammy walking out of the bathroom. Our sterio
also always turns up and down with the volume. Other little things that
happened to my mom is that she saw our old cat in the living room and she
saw our old dog in the yard. Now to the things that happened to me. My
light turned on all by its self and when I was getting in the shower I
saw something black float away from the mirror. So I guess you could say
that my house is haunted.</B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My dad died on December 9, 1999. I was very close
to my father so</B>
<BR><B>when I found out that he died I couldn't hold it together. In the
year</B>
<BR><B>2002. Two years after his death. I started seeing things. When I
go to</B>
<BR><B>bed every night I turn off all of the lights in the house. The only</B>
<BR><B>light that I leave on is the small light above the stove. I woke
up</B>
<BR><B>about 2:00.in the morning&nbsp; to go to the bathroom. As I was
walking</B>
<BR><B>downstairs I noticed that all of the lights were on in my house.
I was</B>
<BR><B>so scared. I am the only one in my house at night. My husband works
at</B>
<BR><B>night and my 2 year old daughter sleeps with me. At first I thought
that</B>
<BR><B>my husband may have came home early that night. But I called him
at work</B>
<BR><B>and he said that he did not.&nbsp; That has happened to me about
three times.</B>
<BR><B>All sorts of things have happened to me. On night my two year old</B>
<BR><B>daughter woke up crying in the middle of the night for a binky.
I got up</B>
<BR><B>out of my bed and went into her room. the binky that I gave her
when she</B>
<BR><B>went to bed was under the covers so I gave her that one. Well she
wanted</B>
<BR><B>another one to hold. So I looked everywhere in the house for one
and I</B>
<BR><B>could not find one. I told her that she had to just sleep with the
one</B>
<BR><B>because I could not find another one. I went back up to my bed after</B>
<BR><B>that. When I got in bed I saw a binky laing right in the middle
of my</B>
<BR><B>pillow. I have no idea how it got there, I was sleeping in that
same</B>
<BR><B>spot before and there was nothing there at all.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I beleive that my father sometimes comes into
my house. Just to let</B>
<BR><B>me know that he is watching me. I don't think that he means to scare
me.</B>
<BR><B>I just think that he wants me to know that he is there. So many
things</B>
<BR><B>have happened to me. I have photos of what I think is his spirt
in them.</B>
<BR><B>I think that he is watching over me.</B>

<P><B>I would like to share another experience with you. This happened
about 6 or 7 years ago now. I was in a shopping mall with my mother, two
nieces and my daughter who was just a toddler. I had never liked the mall
much, right from the time it was first built but had to go there on occaission
to pay some bills. My mother was the one on this particualr day that had
errands to run. The medicare office there always made me feel claustrophobic
to the point of nausea so i avoided having to use it as much as possible.
I never gave any thought really to my feelings, just assuming that government
deparments made most people feel this way. Not long afterwards whilst in
town with my sister she told me her husband would not use that office because
he felt like he couldnt breathe in there. I had not told her of my feelings
about the place.</B>
<BR><B>Anyway the day in question we had all decided to take a break and
have lunch at Mcdonalds with was just across form the medicare office.
It was school holidays and jam packed. My mum cared for the children and
i stood in line to be served, i was in the middle of 5 lines at least a
dozen people deep, it was difficult to move as we were shoulder to shoulder
and moving forward slowly. Suddenly a little man whom i had not noticed
previously stepped back and put his arm around my waist and offered for
me to take his place. I thanked him and said i could not possibly take
his palce after he had waited so long. He told me he had all the time in
the world to wait. I remember smelling armpit type odour, it wasnt offensive
but it was there, he was wearing a crumpled looking cardigan and pants
with a tie but he looked very out of place. He told me how he wished the
world was the way it used to be when he lived with his mother and that
he didnt live far from here. I responded politely and then turned to take
another step forward. When i turned back a split second later he was gone.
The line was more of a crowd and so tight he just couldnt have got out
of sight so quickly. It took me a good few minutes just to get through
the line when i had been served. Somehow i think this man was more attracted
to company than food, why would you stand all that time in a Maccas line
only to disappear. Food for thought(pardon the pun) but if he was a ghost
which my every instinct told me and still tells me he was, was i standing
in the line of people seemingly talking to myself? Did people think i was
nuts...lol? Or do we slip into another dimension momentarily. Which reminds
me of another incident that was witnessed by my sister and myself. But
thats another story.</B>
<BR><B>Thankyou for the opportuntiy to share my experiences.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Haunted Indiana</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Heady122374@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I live in Indiana and one night me and my now husband was in Tipton
In. and we heard some of our friends talking about a haunted house and
me and my husband love things like that so we asked them where it was.They
said its out in the country and they were to afraid to go out there so
they told us how to get there.So me my husband and a few friends went out
there and there was 3 places one we found out was nothing the other 2 were
very creepy.The first one was a house it was close to midnight and very
dark except for a light on the house across the road.We seen a old house
that was falling down we also felt like something was watching us.It did'nt
feel threating so we stayed and was looking toward the house and we seen
a glowing doorbell but there was no doorbell we started to get scared then
we seen a very short female in a long flowing white dress almost like a
wedding dress she was standing by the door her dress looked like the wind
was blowing it but there was'nt enough wind to do it so we left we left
that one and went to the next one it was an old church or school close
to Elwood In. in the country we stopped in front of it and sit in the car
with our lights off and we seen something moving around inside we tryed
to just blow it off but it just kept moving around we did'nt feel like
we were in any harm so we kept watching and it came to the window and we
seen it,it was a male we got really scared and left very quickly,but we
can't stay away we have been back several times.The only times we ever
felt any danger was one night we went with 2 cars and we had 9people in
one cae and 3 in the other a friend of my husbands was driving the car
with 3 people in it my husband was driving the other we stoped in front
of the first place and sit there for a few minutes and seen the same old
woman in the white dress then we left there and went by the school our
friend had already passed it we down one and then came back so we could
be facing the right way and there was a truck our friend wanted to try
and scare them my husband said no I don't like this so we just kept driving
and the truck stoped in front of us and our friend went around him and
stoped to wait on us but the truck had us blocked and we could'nt go around
him and then her turned and started comming toward us outr friend just
took off we had to go in reverse to get away when the tuck got close to
us we seen that no one was driving it it was just a glow around the shape
of a human we finally got turned around and was going very fast and I looked
out the back window and it was still there very colse then I looked in
the rearview mirror and it was still close I looked out the front window
and then out the back window and it was gone there were no houses or roads
around just cornfields we had other people tell us the same thing when
we got back to town our friend said that the truck was after him at the
same time it was after us and we got out of the car and looked at the back
of our car and there was hand prints on the bumper and trunk</B>
<BR><B>The second time we felt in danger was one time we went there with
our friend and he yelled something out the window and I seen a dark shadow
jump through one of the windows and come after us our friend was driving
and he was going kind of fast then all of a sudden the car stoped and would'nt
go anywhere and he had the gas peddle pushed down he was scared and he
don't belive in sprits</B>
<BR><B>The 3rd place is a barn we seen a figure hanging and swinging through
the windows and one night we were there with 2 people that had never been
and we were sitting in front of the barn and me and one of them seen lights
pass across the barn and told my husband to go and the way we were sitting
the only way for the lights to pass across the barn that way was if it
had passed right beside us and it did'nt that happened 3 times another
friend said he heard voices in the field asross from the barn</B>
<BR><B>I just want to know if anyone knows anything about this place</B><B></B>

<P><B>Haunted Experience</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: rwicy@sympatico.ca</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hi my name is Sonya and I live in Ottawa Ontario.</B>
<BR><B>I would like to share with you my experience with the paranormal.</B>
<BR><B>Me and my family had been living in this house for over three years
and nothing weird or unusual ever happened.</B>
<BR><B>One night me and my brother were playing in the basement,</B>
<BR><B>a game of checkers i think it was. Anyways at the same time me and
my brother got the urge to look at the furnice. When we did we seen someone
looking back at us then slowly he dissapaered. We atomaticly thought it
was our other brother playing a trick on us. But when we ran up stairs
to tell our parents we seen our brother sitting with them doing his homework.We
told them what we saw and of course it was nothing they said, our imagination.
We knew other wise. This was not the last time we seen this apparation.
We learned to live with it until we moved a few years later. After we moved
my father told us that he had seen the very same figure once or twice,
but he did not tell us then because he didn't want to scare us.</B>
<BR><B>As children my and my brother have always had weird things happen
to us both. Same with my father. We all have a gift and our welling to
seek out haunted places and study paranormal activities. To see a ghost
opens up many doors for a human, it is a wonderful thing</B><B></B>

<P><B>Grandmas Little Girl</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: dazy_69@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>When I was at my grandma's for lunch one day with a bunch of my friends,
we were all sitting at the kitchen table and all the sudden two of my friends
( Katrina and Nicole) got up out of their seats and asked me and Taneille
if we heard that sound, me and Taneille both just looked at them and thought
that they were playing joke on us so we just ignored them until like 2
minutes later when&nbsp; we heard a little girls voice and we couldn't
quite make out what she was saying but we didn't care we were to scared
so we all got up out of our seats and were all in the corner and then we
heard the voice again and realized what it was saying it was saying Hi
and it was like a little girls voice so we all screamed. Then Katrina looked
at all of us and said lets call Holly (who is my best friend and lives
2 houses down) and so we did and she came over and didn't believe us one
bit she thought that we were just trying to scare her, so since she thought
that we were lying she walked over to the room in the hallway in which
the sounds were coming from and then all you could see was her running
around the corner saying you guys weren't kidding were you? Then we all
looked at her and said I told you. It was almost time to leave to go back
to school when we realized that all of our shoes were at the back door
and in order to get them that we would have to go past the room and none
of us wanted to go, but finally they got me and Holly to go and when we
did we heard like this bell sound coming from the room and we didn't really
want to pay attention to this so we tried to ignore it until we heard the
voice again, then after we heard the voice we stopped and were to scared
to move. While we were standing there we noticed a piece of paper underneath
the door and /holly wanted to see what would happen if she pulled it so
she did, and she was doing it very gentle and it was coming out fine until
we heard a BOOM on the ground and the paper got pulled into the room. We
then jumped and by then the other girls were waiting outside in their bare
feet so we ran and got the shoes and ran out of that house and to this
day I will not stay there by myself.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Grandma's Ashes</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: wbet@apci.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>In April of 99 my grandmother (Liberty Vincent) passed away in a
nursing</B>
<BR><B>home in Alburquque, NM. All her life she did fortune telling for
a</B>
<BR><B>living. She was very accurate and would tell you both the good and
bad.</B>
<BR><B>We had her creamated and sent to us via Fed Express. After 3 days
we did</B>
<BR><B>not recieve her ashes we called the funeral&nbsp; home and they
put a tracer</B>
<BR><B>on her. A month had passed and we finally got her so we could spread
her</B>
<BR><B>ashes. The funny thing was she said she always wanted to travel
so I</B>
<BR><B>guess this was her chance. We spread her ashes in Poplur Bluffs,
MO a</B>
<BR><B>week later. Well...about 2 weeks after that on a Saturday morning
my</B>
<BR><B>husband and I were getting ready to run some errands. As we were
talking</B>
<BR><B>about what bills needed to be mailed our basement door opened, we
just</B>
<BR><B>looked at each other and tried to dismiss it as a draft. However,
I had</B>
<BR><B>4 glass canisters on my kitchen counter and on one of the canisters
was</B>
<BR><B>a huge spot of ashes!!! Neither one of us smoke and I do not have
any</B>
<BR><B>ash trays in my house and we did not open the box of ashes till
we</B>
<BR><B>arrived in Poplur Bluffs at her property. I knew it was my grandmother</B>
<BR><B>letting me know she was around. This is just one of the many, many</B>
<BR><B>encounters that I have experienced in life. I sometimes wonder because</B>
<BR><B>of my family's background with clairvoyance, card reading, and etc..if</B>
<BR><B>this is why we experience the unknown?</B>

<P><B>Grandfather and now Sister</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: bjhoulihan@hotmail</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hi,</B>
<BR><B>This is not as much as a story but a once of expierence so here
is the following of what happened.</B>
<BR><B>I will never forget the night it happened. See I used to sleep upstairs
in my current house which is a two story dwelling. My old bedroom is only
a few yards from the tiolet. I would have been aged between 6 and 8 when
on my usual awaking at night I got up and made my journey to the tiolet
which meant crossing the landing. Anyway I usually could do this with my
eyes closed or in other words half asleep. But this night I was walking
across when I could have sworn I sensed someone coming up the stairs.</B>
<BR><B>So I looked down half expecting to see my father or mother. But
who or what I saw wasn't something I recognised. The man was tall about
6 foot 4 and that was when I thought it was my father. I ran into my parents
room as I was frightened when who I thought was my father wouldn't reply
when I said "hello". When I went into room I seen my father and mother
in bed, I quickly woke them but they only said I must have been seeing
things.</B>
<BR><B>For years I would close my eyes and never look down the stairs when
walking the landing at night. When I was 10 or 11. I was looking at old
photos of my mother who had recently passed away, when I seen the man I
had seen on the stairs. I asked my father who this person was and he told
me it was his father, my grandfather.</B>
<BR><B>I had never seen my grandmother or grandfather as they both died
before I was born. It was then it struck me that it was my grandfather
who I had seen that night.</B>
<BR><B>I am now sleeping downstairs, I am now 17 living in my sisters room,
who also passed away. And I have never seen the figure again. But I am
still in fear of this person.</B>
<BR><B>So basically that is my story of how I have seen my grandfather
even though he is dead. Even now as I type I can still remember the figure
and to be honest at this second of typing I am alone in the house and don't
feel like going upstairs.</B>
<BR><B>On another note has anyone else heard the voice of dead family members.
As lately I can swear I am hearing my deceased sister saying Brian as I
live me room which was originally her's.</B>
<BR><B>Thank you to anyone that has read this, This is my first time telling
anyone about my expierences.</B>
<BR><B>Thank you to the shadowlands it has made me feel normal, after these
expierences.</B>
