<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>insane.<span

memories I can remember that the bedroom in <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>the back of the
house always had an odd feeling to it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I
still have no <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>clue as to what
was in that room but it did not like me.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Early in my <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>childhood I also
had what my parents called imaginary friends that <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>seemed very real
to me that seemed to go away around the time I entered <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>kindergarten at
age five.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I have vague memories of these
&quot;friends&quot;, <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>They talked to
me but I never saw a form just a voice and they always <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>seemed
nice.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I don't know if they had anything
to do with what was in <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>that room but
whatever it was, it was definitley not nice.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>This room <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>was my parents
bedroom it was located behind the kitchen and was <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>adjacent to my
room which I shared with my older brother until he <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>graduated from
high school. There was a doorway between thetwo bedrooms. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Every time I
went into this room I would get an uneasy feeling, as if <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>something was
watching me.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Although this bothered me I
was sure it was <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>just my imagination.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Anyway, around the time that my invisible
friends <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>as my parents
went away I started having wierd dreams about this room. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>at first they
were just me being in the room and then it seemed that <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>with each
subsequent dream it seemed if they got more and more <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>disturbing.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Finally this culminated into a dream in which
I had dozens <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>of times about
some kind of entity dragging me into that room.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>always started
with me being in my room and I would hear something from <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>the other room
and although I would never see what it was it would seem <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>to have me by
the feet and attempt to drag me into that room.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I would <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>try to scream
and either nothing would come from my nouth or it would be <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>very low muffled
scream that I could barely heat myself.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It seemed that <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>this dream would
occur very often but with no regular pattern. Sometimes <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>I would have it
multiple times in one night.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I never saw
what it was <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>that was trying
to drag me into that room but it felt sinister. Some how <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>I seemed to know
if it was successful in getting me in that room that I <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>would die or
worse. I tried to tell people in my family and most of them <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>said I was
letting my mind lay tricks on me or it was just a bad dream.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>My mother never
said these things and always tried to avoid the subject <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>if I brought it
up so after I while I just dealt with it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I still had <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>these dreams but
I tried to convince myself that it was just <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>nightmares.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>These dreams kept going on and around the
time I was <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>thirteen and in
the eighth grade I got my first girlfriend.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>She also <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>had uneasy
feelings in that room.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I'm not sure whre
she got it, but she <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>came over one
day with a ouija board.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I was skeptical
about this and <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>thought it was a
game, well until about 10 minutes into playing with <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>it.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It said somethings that there was no way she
would have known that <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>occured in my
childhood.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It also said somethings about
a bad man who <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>was near.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I took it to be referring to what was in that
room.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>After <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>this I was sure
that they were real.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I was getting into
that cocky <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>brave invicible
teenager mode that kids always seem to have. I decided I <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>wanted to know
more.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This house was situated on a large
lot in front of <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>and next to two
large grain fields.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>About 100 yards or
so to the left <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>of our house
there was another house that had been partially burned and <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>was then
converted into a shed for a tractor.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I
had never really <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>explored this
shed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Before becoming a shed this was a
house that some <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>of ny relatives
lived in. That was about all I knew about it. One dayt <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>my girlfriend
and I were walking from her house which was about 2 miles <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>away and it
started to rain. Well although not far from my house it <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>started to rain
pretty hard so we decided to wait for it to slack up <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>some before we
walked the football field length from there to my house.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>We went in and
almost immediatley I got a similar uneasy feeling that I <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>knew pretty well
by now.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She asked me what was wrong and
all I could <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>say was
something about this place isn't right. She went into her back <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>pack and came
out with the ouija board.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I though oh
well it's daylight <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>and oh well it
couldn't really hurt us.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We started and
after a few <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>minutes of
unintellidgable letters it stopped and the air seemed to get <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>colder.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I didn't know at the time that was one of the
signs of a spirit <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>being
around.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Anyway she said is anyone there
and it almost immediately <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>slid to yes and
stopped.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then we asked some random<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>questions and got <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>the expected
answers.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The rain had slacked up and we
decided to go on <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>to my
house.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A few days later we decided that
something was definitely <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>odd about that
old half burned house. We ventured back. This time we <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>went in the mid
afternoon and it was a hot summer day. I think this was <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>in mid June and
it was really hot outside.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We went in and
announced <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>ourselves making
mention that we talked a few days before.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Nothing <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>seemed odd.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We were just trying to see if we could get
some <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>confirmation
that something was there without using the ouija board.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Nothing
happened, so we took out the board and lit some candles because <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>it was a little
dark in there some light peeked in through holes in the <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>roof.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We started to try to ask some questions about
who or what was in <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>the area and
such.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>At first the spirit we were
talking to seemed nice <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>and unthreatening
but it said that it must leave and almost imediately <o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>Later that <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>summer, my

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>of whrere we
were living.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>After we moved the dreams
seemed to go away.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Several years
passed and I decided that I wanted to know what went on at <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>that place. I
asked my mom if she ever experienced anything strange <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>there.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She had lived there after my parents were
married up until the <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>time they split
up so I was sure that if something was there I was not <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>the only one to
experience it. Well she told me that she felt the same <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>uneasy feeling
about there room that I had felt.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She
said that it <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>always felt like
someone was watching here in there.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She
said she never <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>told anyone
because my dad said she was crazy that he never had anything <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>like that happen.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So then I asked about the shed.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She said that my <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>uncle lived
there until he died and then the house burned.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I asked if <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>anyone was hurt
in the fire but she said that no one was there when it <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>burned.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I told her about the experiences with the ouija
baoard and she <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>got wierd look
on here face and then she told me about some stuff that <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>happened before
I was born.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She didn't give specifics
about names but <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>she said that I
had some rellatives whose house burned and three <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>children died in
the fire.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Their bodys were laid out in
that house <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>before the
funeral.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She also said that it was
suspected that the fire <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>that killed
these children was set for insurance money.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I don't know if <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>it was their
spirits or something else but after we moved the dreams <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>stopped and
everything seemed to be normal. I say normal but I still <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>have paranormal
experiences where I will see people not there or other <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>odd things. I
have not felt a presence like the one in that room since <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>then and I never
want to feel anything like that again.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I
never figured <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>out quite what
this was or if the the everts were related.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>These dreams <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>traumatized me
as a child and although I don't feel that I need answers <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>to it, I just
felt I needed to share the account of what happened with <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>others hoping
that it would help. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>In closing, I
wouldn't reccommend anyone go ghost hunting as I did. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the ouija board seemed to agitate it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>At
first it <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>seemed that we
were contacted by a somewhat friendly entity then it <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>would leave and
the mean would come.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I still live close

longer.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I am twenty-five now and I have
done a lot of <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>research into
the paranormal and I now know what I did was stupid. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Hospital<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>By:

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>I now own the
hospital and it is utterly amazing. We have heard sounds of something working
on the boiler late at night that even draw the attention of our many animals.
There is a faint humming in one wing of the hospital though there is no
electrical power to the building. I have personally seen a little boy who I
thought was coming down the driveway to the house in the back to see my
daughter. I called to him in the twilight that she was out front and started to
walk towards him. As I got closer I realized he was on the stairs to the side
of the building and disappeared out of sight when I reached that point. We have
taken pictures of the windows and have been able to bring up the face of a young
woman with prominent cheekbones and a pointed chin with long curly hair with a
elderly gentleman in the background. On photoshop we magnified the image. The
picture was taken in a stairwell that is twelve feet off the floor. There are
many orbs around the building and a local newspaper reporter and photographer
who did a story on it this past Halloween photographed a white mist in a second
floor window that seems to be a focus point to some residents of town giving
them an uneasy feeling when they drive by.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>The previous
owner had tried to change a portion of the second floor wing but left
everything in the middle of the construction and moved far away without selling
the place first. He has never mentioned anything to us but it is obvious
something made him uncomfortable because he just wanted out.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>We feel nothing
but peacefulness when we are in the building and are hoping to gain landmark
status to protect the building. Many people died here during the 1947 tornado
since it was the only point of refuge for the town. We consider it hallowed
ground and are supported by the many people who have an attachment to the
building for various reasons. We are amazed by the amount of people who travel
from different states who were born here who just want to visit it. It is a
compelling place that we hope to preserve.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Okay, when I was
little, right after my grandpa (Pa Jack) died, my mom says I would wake up in
the middle of the night just a laughing and screaming out loud, when she came
in and asked me what was goin on, I would tell her that Pa Jack was tickling
me. And the weird thing was that he used to tickle me before he died. And my
mom woke up one night and she saw Pa Jack standing beside her bed and he was
screaming (I won't use the real name but) &quot;JERRY! JERRY! JERRY!&quot; And
he just disappeared. She called her brother, &quot;Jerry,&quot;<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>and it turns out that he was deadly sick and
if she wouldn't have called, the he probably would've died... Sha, real cool.

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>My name is
Jessica, and I live about 12 miles outside of a little town called Berlin, in
Somerset PA. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>When I was a
little girl growing up down in the &quot;middle of nowhere&quot; I heard ghost
stories all the time. There is one where a man walks what we call the
&quot;Mountain Road&quot; with a lantern looking for his lost love who got lost
in the woods. I never believed in the stories or ghosts until one night I went
for a walk with my dog. Usually my dog was trailing behind me, but this time
she was going in front of me acting as if she did not want to me walk any
closer to the barn or the light, but I kept pushing her aside and kept walking
towards the light. I had my ear phones on and I was listening to music. I got a
feeling that I wasn't alone, so I took my ear phones off and turned the music
off. I listened very quietly, and as soon a I was about to yell out &quot;who's
there&quot; I heard what to me sounded like an old covered wagon up in the
field. I couldn't see anything, but I could hear it. I heard a whistle, and the
sound of hooves hitting the ground and the wheels turning. My dog started to
bark, and I got scared and ran into the house. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>The next day I
went to the field where I thought the sound of the wheels was coming from, and
there was hove prints and wheel tracks. I followed them for about 5 min. and
then they just vanished, it was like they just disappeared, the tracks stopped.
Then I started to follow them back to where I was, and the same thing happened.
I got to the point where I heard them, and started to follow them back for
about 5 min. and they disappeared. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

get any photos, but I showed my mom and dad, none of us could explain it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>here is one.
this was an experience with god.:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>As i was about 7

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>stove started
bubbling and boiled over the edges. We run over and it <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>suddenly stops
and goes back down. My mom puts her hand in it and its cold, <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>as i put my hand

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>watching my
nightly program, i slowly limped to my cold, damp room. Hence, <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>my heating ducts
arent very good, and my room is on the complete oppisite <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>As i arrived in

over to my bed and crawled under the blankets and flanel <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>sheets. It was a
freezing night, and my bed was freezing. As I was half <o:p></o:p></span></p>

remember my mother walking in and turning off my heater. After <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>that i was
completely emboweled in the satisfying darkness of slumber. I was <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>sound asleep,
and not to be disturbed, untill my own crys of terror awakens <o:p></o:p></span></p>

watching TV, to vague to tell what program it was, i was merley <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>that i could
make out, i zoned everything out. As my mother walks into the <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>kitchen from my
long, outstretched foyer. The foyer seemed like it was 50 <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>feet long, a
great chandelier hanging from the sky, expensive wall murials, <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>and a marble
floor which was mixed in with red. She greets me with a mere <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>kiss on the
cheek, and a brief conversation. She persuaded me into my dining <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>room, which was
empty with baige carpeting, white walls, and a chandelier on <o:p></o:p></span></p>

leads me to a window, where we look out into the unknown.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>As we scanned
down from the sky, I notice that there is allready a inch of <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>because it was
that time of the season. As we just stare into the edge of <o:p></o:p></span></p>

in excruciating pain and agony. It lasts for about 5 <o:p></o:p></span></p>

out. I tremble in my dream, even though it does not seem <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>like it. I look
at my mother and she does not make a sound. We stare into <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>We look into the

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>after 5 seconds,
then recites. Finally she grabs my arm and takes me to my <o:p></o:p></span></p>

there and keep getting these haunting phone calls of a man <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>I LOVE THE
WEBSITE AND READING ALL OF THE STORIES. I HAVE ONE OF MY OWN AND I HOPE THIS IS
THE RIGHT WAY OF GETTING IT POSTED ON THE SITE. ANYWAYS HERE IT GOES... I HAVE
ALWAYS BEEN ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO ENJOY BEING SCARED. I MET MY BOYFRIEND
ABOUT 2 YEARS AGO AND THE FIRST TIME I STEPPED IN HIS GRAMMAS HOUSE I FELT A
PRESENCE. I ALWAYS FEEL LIKE I AM BEING WATCHED EVERY TIME I AM IN THE HOUSE
AND IT WORSE WHEN I AM ALONE. THE CATS STARE AT THINGS THAT AREN'T THERE. THE
FIRST OCCURRENCE WAS WHEN I WAS RATHER NEW TO THE HOUSE AND THE SPIRIT DIDN'T
KNOW ME(I GUESS). ANYWAYS IT WAS JUST ME AND MY BOYFRIENDS GRANDMA IN THE HOUSE
AND SHE WAS IN THE KITCHEN AND I WAS CLEANING UP MY BOYFRIENDS ROOM. I THINK
THE SPIRIT DIDN'T LIKE ME TOUCHING HIS THINGS BECAUSE I FELT AN EVIL FEELING,
LIKE I WAS DOING SOMETHING I WASN'T SUPPOSED TO. I HEARD A NOISE IN GRAMMAS
ROOM AND FROZE. I KNEW SHE WAS IN THE KITCHEN. I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING BUT I FELT
IT. SOMETHING CAME FROM HIS GRAMMAS ROOM AROUND THE CORNER AND INTO THE ROOM
WHERE I WAS. I FELT VERY SCARED AND WHATEVER IT WAS WENT RIGHT THROUGH ME AND
THE TV, WHICH WAS ON BEHIND ME, SUDDENLY WENT OFF AND MADE A WEIRD LOUD NOISE.
I RAN OUT AND INTO THE KITCHEN WITH GRANDMA. I TOLD HER WHAT HAPPENED AND SHE
HAD SOME STORIES OF HER OWN. IT TURNS OUT THAT THE GHOST HAS BEEN AROUND FOR A
WHILE. SHE SAID THAT SHE HAS SEEN THINGS AND PEOPLE WALKING AROUND THE KITCHEN.
ONCE SHE WOKE UP WITH A BIG WHITE DOG IN HER FACE. ALL SHE COULD DO WAS LAY
THERE AND GO BACK TO SLEEP. NOW GRANDMA IS 86 AND WOULD HAVE NO REASON TO LIE
ABOUT ANYTHING LIKE THIS. THEN I WAS TALKING TO MY BOYFRIENDS DAD AND HE HAD
SOME STORIES TO TELL AS WELL. ONE NIGHT HE CAME HOME AND FOUND HIS SAFE, WHICH
IS ONE OF THOSE OLD BIG HEAVY METAL SAFES, THROWN ACROSS THE ROOM AND OPEN. NO
MAN COULD PICK UP THAT SAFE OR GET IT OPEN.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>ONE TIME HE WAS MOPING IN HIS FLOOR AND IN THE WATER APPEARED LITTLE
FOOTPRINTS AND THERE WAS NO LITTLE KIDS IN THE HOUSE. THEN HE WAS TELLING MY
BOYFRIEND AND I ABOUT ONE TIME WHEN HE SAW HIS DRAWER ON THE DESK OPEN BY
ITSELF AND AS WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE GHOST WE ALL HEARD A LOUD NOISE IN THE
BATHROOM (LIKE THE TOILET LID FALLING). WHEN WE LOOKED IN THE BATHROOM THE
TOILET LID DIDN'T FALL AT ALL, IT WAS UP! I COULD UNDERSTAND IF THE LID JUST
FELL, BUT TO BE LIFTED UP HARD IS A DIFFERENT THING ENTIRELY. A FEW OTHER
THINGS HAVE HAPPENED. ONCE I WAS IN THE LAUNDRY ROOM (WHICH SEEMS TO BE THE
SOURCE OF THE EVIL) AND I DROPPED SOMETHING OF GRAMMAS ON THE GROUND. ALL OF
THE SUDDEN I FELT A SCARY AND EVIL FEELING LIKE I HAD NEVER FELT. I RAN OUT OF
THERE AND UPSTAIRS SO FAST. I THINK THE GHOST IS OF GRAMMAS DAUGHTER (SHE DIED
IN HER 30S AF CANCER) AND HER THINGS ARE STORED IN THE LAUNDRY ROOM UNDER THE
STAIRS. SHE IS VERY PROTECTIVE OVER THE HOUSE AND NEVER BOTHERS MY BOYFRIEND. OK
SO THIS TURNED OUT REALLY LONG SO IF I THINK OF ANYTHING ELSE I WILL LET YOU
GUYS KNOW. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Hi there. This
may be something or nothing but it actually happened to me and I have NEVER
been able to explain this. I also am sure I didn't black-out. Maybe you can
shed some light on this.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Here goes......<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>I used to live in Cornwall, England, from 1973
- 1985 I then moved to London in my early 20's but my memories and experiences
of the place remain with me forever. I now live in Australia. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>I used to be
actively involved in, I suppose, dangerous sports; Climbing, Surfing,
Motorcycle motocross and trials and even M/C street racing. Bit of a rebel I'm
afraid! (Not now). I can't help but feel that I was always looked after by some
unseen force. There were so many events that took place which prevented me from
having serious accidents I will not be able to mention them all, they just
happened and I remember them and I will never forget them. I also never ever
tested this strange thing as I had what I can only describe as an almighty
respect for this &quot;protection&quot;.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>The most
memorable was whilst on a climb at Crackington Haven Beach I got stuck mid-way
on a cliff face; I would have been about 13/14 yrs old at the time, there was
no way up and only the tough route down (which would have been instant death).
All I remember was that I was in a serious state of panic! My friend had run
back to the village to get air sea rescue and other help. I must have been in a
panic state for about 15 mins. It's a strange sensation as you can seem to
accept the inevitable end. Anyway, I all of a sudden felt a calming influence
coming over me (I'm getting goosebumps recalling this) and I'm not sure what
happened but I found myself laying on my back at the top! One minute I was
contemplating jumping, the next thing I knew I was safe at the top! When my
friend arrived with my mother and a whole bunch of others I was walking towards
them wondering what all the fuss was about. I have no recollection of climbing
up (Couldn't anyway as it was all loose shingle and I was stuck on a ledge
which essentially saved me from falling to the bottom) all I remember was the
calm and peace. It was as though I was lifted to the top. My mother and my
friend could figure out how I got to the top. This event haunted me for years.
Every night I would say a prayer of thanks to whoever it was that saved me. I
know it sounds cranky but this really did happen. When I was back in
Crackington in 1998 I went back to the cliff edge. Believe me, it is impossible
to &quot;climb&quot; up.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

grandmother use to clean houses for a real estate agency. One particular house
that they had to clean was one of the oldest houses in Maryland. It even had a
dirt basement. When they cleaned one room the door behind them would slam shut
and they heard someone walking upstairs when they knew it was the only two of
them in the house. When they we're down in the basement the foot steps we're
heard on the first floor. My grandmother was extremely religious woman and did
not believe in the super natural refused to be separated from my mother in the
house so it took longer for them to clean the house. They heard in the kitchen
water running and cabinets slamming open and shut. Once they we're finished the
cleaning and we're about to leave they heard a woman screams coming from up
stairs. Quickly they left glade they wouldn't have to return.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>I just returned
from a Thanksgiving Day stay at the Louisville landmark. After my wife and I
retired for the evening, within the first 5 minutes, she asked me if I'd turned
the light on. Both of us were in bed but were very much awake still by this
time. I opened my eyes and the same lamp I'd turned off not 5 minutes earlier
was on again!! The lamp was the kind that had a decisive&quot;click&quot; to it
when you turned it off so I know I had it off. And like I'd said, we were still
both awake so had she reached over me or gotten out of bed to walk around to
turn on the light, I would have known. I reached over and once again,turned the
lamp switch till it &quot;clicked&quot; off. I layed there with my eyes open
this time staring into a mirror that was leaning up against the wall. I layed
there watching the mirror until I just fell asleep and never heard or saw
anything again. The lamp stayed off this time!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Well, this
didn't exactly happen to me, but it happened to my grandmother and her mother
in the 40's in Brazil. My grandmother was young, and she had just bought her
first house with my grandfather and she had two little daughters (my aunts,
obviously). My father wasn't born yet. My grandmother isn't a person to lie, so
this story is no bull. Well, it was around 1945, and my grandmother was
preparing food in the kitchen for my aunts. My grandfather was at work, so she
was alone with her two daughters. She heard footsteps coming down the
livingroom and down the hall. She thought that was strange because my
grandfather wouldn't come home, only 5 hours later. She went to greet him, but
instead was greeted by a terrible cold gust of wind.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>She shrugged it
off and went on with her life. But until the next day, she was cooking for my
two aunts (my oldest aunt was around 5 and the second was around 2), she heard
the same footsteps, and she noticed that it would always end at her mothers
room (my great-grandmother would sleep there sometimes.) She grabbed her two
daughters and waited outside for my grandfather to come. This would always
happen at lunchtime (around 12 P.M.) Well, my grandfather was always skeptical
when it came to ghosts so he comforted her and told her she was hearing things.
She believed him, and went on.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>The next day my
great-grandmother went to sleep there, she would sleep there to help out my grandmother
with the girls, and the footsteps still came, but my grandmother felt safe
because she was with her mother and two daughters, so she didn't mind it. At
night, my great-grandmother was sleeping and she felt the bed go down as if
someone was sitting down on it. Then, she felt a hand caressing her face. She
got the heck out and never returned to that house. They lived there for 2 more
years, soon after my father was born they moved. So thats my story. I do not
believe she was lying because she isn't a person to lie about that. Thank you!!

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>A group of
friends and me a few years ago went to a place in Columbia Maryland off of
route 32 I believe it was called Jefferson something, there are several
buildings there which include a school a church and several other buildings
around the area. Its all closed down and guards watch over the place but we
snuck past to see, what we found was more than what we thought we would and as
you go into the first house up the path inside youll find bloody hand prints
on the doors, as we went further we came across some papers talking about
stabbings there which we were going to take with us but something else there
didnt want us to take them as it let us know right away. There was a boiler
room that we went in after that where the door slammed shut and locked us in as
soon as we all went in there so we had to break a window in order to get out,
after we got out three of us all looked up and can testify to seeing an orb
hover above us and just go in back of one of the buildings there. When you
enter several buildings mind you this was in the summer time you will feel very
cold in several spots around there. If interested I have several other stories
of place in Maryland and other states-Mark,<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>

stories i could share some would be unbelieveable but they are 100% true...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>I'll start with
letting you all know that i come from a pretty religious family especially my
father who dedicates his life to God,work and last but not least his family and
has countless sightings of crosses floating in the sky or other religious
things like...which i will not talk about at the moment because im here to talk
about ME haha<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Ive had
countless experiences throughtout my life my first experience happened when i
lived in my old house back in 1995 my grandpa had passed away in serbia.
Anyways i had been very deeply connected with my grandpa as a child although i
only saw him once a year for about a couple of weeks so when he passed away i
was very upset. All throughout child hood i had been afraid to sleep alone
resorting to having my mum sleep with me except for the night i found out he
passed i was sleeping soundly till about 2am when i instinctively opened my
eyes and looked at the foot of my bed where i saw a sihoulette of a tall dark
figure standing infront of me i felt the room just fill with love and joy...i
was mostly shocked so i had to close my eyes and reopen them and when i did he
was gone...i knew it was my pop visiting me..all the way from serbia.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Anyways we had
heaps of scary experiences in that old house in mascot (australia) (our new
house is built ontop of the same land) it was really haunted at 3am everyone
morning our photos on the wall would start shake and the light in the hallway
would turn itself off (my brother slept with it on cos his room had no door and
he was scared) we would hear footsteps and scratching in the ceiling ...it was
very freaky.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Anyways after
1998 nothing out of the ordinary happened to me uptil this year 2004<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>i moved out with
my boyfriend to a flat somewhere in Brighton le sands (australia) and we've had
many weird occurences we've had the tv<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>turn on by itself or switch off by itself or we'd have complaints from
people sleeping over in the 2nd bedroom which we never use that they hear
childrens voices (i had done a seance in that room and spoken to about 3kids)
anyways my boyfriend and his mates were always uneasy when strange things
happened by i was never unnerved by them i have no idea why....i felt like the
presence wasnt evil it was just there...one experience i will never forget is
the night me and my boyfriend had a massive row and we broke up i was ready to
move on and we were discussing what was to happen the following day...we
somehow started discussing the bible and how great God is..and then out of
nowehre the laptop in the other room turned on by istelf and started playing my
boyfriend song (he's a producer) we just stopped and started at each other both
knowing that the battery was dead and that we hadnt plugged it into the wall
and last time i checked it was off...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>on my 16th bday
me and my mates went to a tiny wood opposite my house at night- that was known
for weird happenings ghosts and strange noises- .we went as a laf we were all
arrogant and we were scaring each other.we jumped over the style infront of the
woods and walked up a small sloped path.when one off my mates screamed &quot;oh
shite what the hell was that?&quot; a zombie like moan echoed through the woods
i saw and heard it too but hoping to get further i said it was a bird, but it
wasn't it was a massive black figure drifting between the trees, and i knew
it.the group lost there confidence and ran back out.we had a massive argument
me and my mate against the other 3.i said they would regret if they didn't go
back in but they didn't care, they knew som ething wasn't right. i should have
listened.so arrogantly we hopped back in.we got to the clearing-our mates kept
callin us- checkin up on us, while we were gathering our nerves.then something
happened.a resting flock of pheasants went mental! shocked we became
disorientated and looked around.then this figure that i saw at the beginning
dived out of the trees and landed inches away from my face. my mate was gone
while i was literally petrified.i gathered my senses and ran for my life,
luckily i escaped but my mates heard very heavy footsteps behind me.we heard
that moan for the rest of the night and we could not sleep. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>about the saint
louis job corps. i was a resident there and i can tell you some very odd
things. first off the whole base is/ was a world war 2 wepon storage or makers
or wepons. there 100's of tunnels and hidden areas that no ones alot to know
about and to this day people still say they find stuff there. t and rate. im
not a good writer so ill just tell you what i felt and saw.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>My name is
Kriston<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>i was a resident there id say in
2002 ish. about id say after 1 month i stayed in the bottom part of the dorms.
i think its Dorm 4 maybe room 101 or something like it. If i was there i could
show you lol. I was only in that room for a short time. I was sleeping one
night and i herd some really loud knocking on the outside window. it woke me up
probly 2 times id say. I never got up to investagate it. Alot of people like to
sneak into the other rooms. aaka the girls into the boys rooms. I do rember
saying out loud to stop that damn knocking im trying to sleep. And i did wake
up the others on the 2nd time i herd knocking. Cause it wouldnt stop. Like i
said i asume that maybe a girl or someone was just sneaking in. Well after
talking to the guys the next day they tell me that no one was comeing though
the window and no one was up. I have very clearly heard the sound of a knock on
the window. like someone wanting to come in from the outside.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>I did look at
the window the next day. Funny thing is the window is too high up for anyone to
reach. the window is right above the stairs to the basement (which is closed
off) and is impossable to reach. there are pipes below thje window but is still
unreachable from human hands.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>My only guess is
the place (the dorms) was once an old storage building(s) and when they made
them into dorm they sealed of alot of old doorway and windows with bricks.
perhaps an old ghost was useing the old storage layout of a door? or perhaps
trying to tell me something? who knows.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>i hope this
helps if you want anymore history of the place it really is just odd and
mysterious. about the place.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>One morning in
1998 or so, I was doing laundry.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was
8:30 in the morning, and I had that show &quot;Haunted History&quot; on the
television.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I had taped the show, so I
was watching it as I was folding clothes.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I like candles, and there was a lit candle on top of the television.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>I had just
finished hearing a story of a Union Civil War soldier who liked to appear to
women.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I believe the ghost was from
Savannah, Georgia.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Anyway, I went
downstairs to change the wash around, and I was coming back upstairs from the
basement with a laundry basket full of clothes in my arms.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I got to the top of the cellar steps and
grabbed the doorknob with my hand, you know, as it was holding the basket.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My arms were full.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I walked through the door, and then I decided
to kick the door closed behind me.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As I
kicked the door closed behind me, I turned my head to see...<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Lo and behold,
there on the steps, standing ever so lifelike, was a Civil War soldier dressed
in a blue uniform with a hat.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He had
brown, slightly curly hair.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He was about
5' 6'' and thin.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He followed me upstairs
from the basement.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He was hunched over a
little bit, as if to lean in, you know, like you do when you want to whisper
something to someone.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I saw his face as
he was hunched over, and he said, &quot;Pssst,&quot; like he was trying to get
my attention.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The door to the basement
swung closed at that very same moment he said &quot;Pssst,&quot; from the force
of my kicking it shut.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>I walked to the
middle of the kitchen and stood there frozen for a minute, thinking, oh, my
God, did I just see that?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I had
goosebumps all over, and my hair was standing on ends.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Finnally, I just
continued on into the living room with the laundry basket and said,
&quot;Pssst, yourself.&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>I can only
assume that the lit candle on the top of the television drew the ghost to
me.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I hope the ghost appreciated my
sarcasm!!!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>This ghostly
incident happened in a house in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Far away from Savannah, Georgia.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The house wasn't that close to Gettysburg
either (about a four hour drive), but we had been there many times.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Thinking about
the incident later, I got a little bit mad that this ghost did this to me
coming up from the basement steps.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It
could have been dangerous if he had scared me bad enough with my arms full of
laundry actually on the basement steps.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I could have fallen and gotten hurt.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I'm glad I didn't fall and get hurt, and I'm glad he didn't scare me
while I was actually walking up the steps.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>My newborn (whom
is about 16 weeks old) seems to have a friend here at our home that nobody else
can see. He stares into a corner of our living room and coo's and laughs at
what he see's. At first we thought he was focusing on a tiger poster in that
same vicinity but it seems he's looking quite a bit to the right of this
picture. I'm pretty sure he's got a ghost friend and have been trying to get
pictures of it. At times he's really interested in that corner we've pulled out
the camer (my wife and myself) and took pictures of that corner. My wife said
during one of the pictures she noticed the flash didn't come on (odd). So
hopefully we'll get a good picture out of those. Just wanted to share that
story with you folks. And I love your site.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>I have recently
found out that this restaurant has actually been reported as haunted. Hearing
that has helped me make sense of an odd incident that happened to me there one
afternoon. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>I was a college
student home for the summer staying with my parents at their new home in
Duluth, GA. My mother had a group of ladies she hung out with. They would play
tennis, go shopping, and to lunch. I was asked to go along with them one day. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>On that day, we
had shopped longer than expected and we ended up at The Public House Restaurant
around 2:15 PM. The restaurant was just about to close and we were the only
group in the restaurant. They sat our group of 7 in the middle of the dinning
room. The restaurant looks like an old mill or store from the 1800's, with
antiques on the wall. Nothing real unusual for that area of Roswell, GA. After
about 10 minutes I decided to go to the restroom. I excused myself from the
table and asked the waiter where the restroom was and proceeded to the ladies
room. I went through a short hall and opened the door to the ladies room. Once
inside I was shocked at how cold in was! I immediately rationalized it as an air-conditioning
malfunction. It was August in Atlanta, and I could see my breath it was so cold
in that room! Anyway, I went into a stall and proceeded to relieve myself and
the hairs on the back of my neck stood up as a strange feeling hit me. I felt
scared all of a sudden, then I saw the toilet paper start streaming out all by
itself. I pulled my pants up and immediately exited the ladies room. I got back
to the table and my mother noticed I looked white as a sheet, but I just told
her I'd talk to her later. I was hoping someone else would go into the ladies
room and say something but the ladies went into the restroom in groups about 20
mins after my experience. I did tell my mother about the incident later and she
has come to believe I had some kind of strange encounter at the Public House in
Roswell. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>I do not tell
this story often because it sounds so ridiculous will the toilet paper and all.
I have tried to rationalize it but recently I heard that the Public House has
been reported as haunted and that would make sense of what happened in the
ladies room that day. I guess it must be a ghost with a sense of humor! <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Thanks for
letting me tell my story.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>I have always
been a believer in the supernatural and believe that spirits do
&quot;live&quot; among us. This belief was further strengthened when I was
pregnant with my first son in 1999. I was living in a very old house (I an not
sure of the year it was built but I would venture to say that it was approx. 75
to 100 years old) that had been renovated slightly into single rooms and small
apartments to be rented out.This story includes two accounts that I,and my
friend believe was the same spirit. My friend ,her boyfriend and her newborn
child stayed there. Their apartment was on the second floor and mine was on the
first, the room in which they and the baby slept was directly above me. One the
first incident, it was between 10:00 and 10:30 at night and i was up watching
television because I could not sleep when I heard what I knew was footsteps
above me paseing back and forth. Now,I must tell you that my friends infant son
was suffering from turned out to be pyloric stenousis which caused him to have
symptoms similar to a stomach virus, and on this evening my friend and her boyfriend
had gone to bed as soon as they had managed to get the baby to sleep which was
about 9pm according to her account. In the morning I had gone upstairs to visit
with them and my fiend proceeded to tell me that the baby had slept all night
and when awakening in the morning she found him sleeping at the foot of his
crib, perfectly covered up and in the only spot in the crib that was
clean(since he had obviously been sick ring the night). Now mind you,this child
was no more then 4- 6 weeks old and was in no way able to crawl or scoot around
in that manner yet. she had asked her boyfriend if he had gotten up with the
baby in the night and he swore he had not. Neither one of them, even as
exhausted as they had been the night before, had heard the baby utter so much
as a whimper. This is when I had told them that I was awake at approx.10:30 the
night before and had heard the footsteps passing back and forth in their
bedroom,in about the spot that the baby's crib was. Both of them swore that
they were in bed and asleep by no later then 9:30. The next incident occurred
to only me when I was alone in my apartment. Like I said,I was pregnant with my
first child and on this particular evening, my back was so sore that I was
having a great deal of difficulty getting comfortable. I sat down on the couch
and turned to put my feet up on it when I felt a &quot;presence&quot; sit
directly behind me on the arm of the couch and just then I felt a
&quot;hand&quot; on my lower back directly on the area that was sore. I was
startled but did not feel threatened by or scared of this presence. Instead, I
felt comforted and flooded by a warm tingling sensation. I tried to move or
speak,but was left unable. This incident only lasted about 30 to 45 seconds at
most but the pain in my back was gone. I sat there for several minutes
contemplating what had happened. Stunned yet grateful to whatever or whomever
did this. When telling of this to my friend after the incident with her baby,we
decided that whoever this was they were there to help us and was more then
likely an overly friendly and kindhearted spirit.Neither one of us ever had the
opportunity to do any research on the house to find out about possible former
owners or connections to the house; however, to this day I feel happy when
thinking of these occurrences and hope that if that spirit is still in the
house that they are still watching over whomever resides there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>I used to be a
security guard at Cordage Park, your site said there are two ghosts, its
believed there is more than that. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>In Mill 2, the
medical wing, the ghost there is said to have been a former security guard who
still patrols. All the security guards have been told dont walk down the
middle of the hallway. If the ghost/guard is walking along, he will push you
out of his way. Myself and a couple other guards have heard a small girl
laughing late at night. A young girl dressed in late 19th century, early 20th
century clothing has been seen, but always disappears before you can catch up
with her. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>In the mill with
the chimney stack, back in the 19th century, a young teen died while cleaning
the stack. Now, if someone goes in there, rocks are thrown at the trespasser. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Mill 1 has one,
possibly 2 ghosts. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Its said that
the elevators are run by the security guard, and if you get on his good side,
as you approach the elevators, you can ask him to push the button to call the
elevator, and he will. I thought this was a story. After the first month,
following the advice about where to walk, I tried it. Ever since until my last
day I always asked, and he always got the elevator for me. He even helped me
find a couple of kids that had broken in by opening doors leading me to where
they were hiding, and he had pushed a box to scare them from their hiding
place.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>When the company
I worked for lost the account with Cordage, the new security guards complained
the elevators worked against them, going up/down a floor when they wanted to
use it, or if they were able to get on the elevator wouldnt go till they used
the stairs, then the elevator would meet them on the floor they wanted to go
to, not sure if its still happening though. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>With the
exception of the boy in the smoke stack, the ghosts are all pretty harmless,
leaving people alone during the day, only playing at night. The boy in the
smoke stack is very angry and will try to hit you if you enter his building. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>We had just
moved into a new house when I was about 11. I was so excited because it was a
bigger house than our old one. A couple of weeks after we moved in something
started happening in my room. I would wake up in the middle of the night and my
bed would be shaking. I would run to my mom's room and wake her up to tell her
but she told me to go back to bed. This continued almost every single night.
About a month later my mom found out that she was pregnant and that they were
going to use my room as the baby's new room and I was going to be moving down
into the basement. I was so excited I was going to have the whole basement to
myself. After the baby was born my brother whose room was right next to the new
baby's room started having these horrible night terrors. He would wake up in
the middle of the night screaming and pointing in the corner of his room. He
would run into the living room and into the kitchen like something was chasing
him. This went on for years. When we would leave the house and come home my
brother's door would be locked and the light would be on. This happened at least
3 times a week. When we moved out my brother's night terrors stopped and
nothing else happened!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Let me first
explain, I'm not psychic. I don't think that I am particularly<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>sensitive. I
know that some of my friends &amp; I in high school did mess around<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>with some stuff
(ouija boards, going to cemeteries, etc.) that wasn't the<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>brightest of
ideas, but it wasn't meant to be harmful. For what ever reason,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>I seem to
attract this kind of energy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>My parents had
bought a house in a brand new development in West Windsor, NJ<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>in 1992. It was
built on a former sod farm, nothing too strange that we knew<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>about. From the
very beginning, I had gotten weird vibes &amp; sensations there,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>that something
just wasn't right. My grandmother's sister, who was very<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>sensitive, did
not like coming over, that she never felt comfortable there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>I never saw
anything outright when I lived there, but I always got some<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>strange vibes.
My late grandmother did have a frightening experience. She<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>had fallen
asleep watching TV in the family room and awoke around 2 am to 2<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>men standing in
front of her. She screamed and they were gone! I would get<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>sensations of
cold in certain spots in the house, especially in the front<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>room. A lot of
misery befall my family when they lived there too. Maybe it<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>was coincidence,
maybe not.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>In 1994, I lived
for a brief time at 50 Main St. in Roebling. It was once a<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>doctor's office
and I believe a post office at one point in time. I had many<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>strange
experiences in that house. My husband was going to school at night<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>and worked full
time, so I was there by myself a lot. There was a room that<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>was used for
storage between our kitchen and the garage. I never wanted to<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>be in there by
myself-it was a very oppressive feeling and I had a hard time<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>breathing when I
would be in there. There had been several times when I was<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>doing laundry in
the basement that I felt as if someone was standing behind<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>me. Every so
often I would catch a glimpse of an<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>older, heavy set woman<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>outside. Since
there was an alley directly behind the house I assumed it was<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>a neighbor.
Apparently no one (alive) in the neighborhood fit the<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>description. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>The one thing
that did me in was the 3rd floor. When my husband lived there<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>as a teenager,
he &amp; his brother shared it and his brother had put mirrors<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>along one whole
wall. For whatever reason, I was never able to look at those<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>mirrors-I don't
know if I was afraid of what I'd see or what, but I never<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>could. I had
originally planned on making the other room there into my<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>sewing room. One
afternoon I was up sweeping when I felt as if someone was<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>in the room with
me (I knew I was home alone). It was such a palatable<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>presence. I
started to pray out loud-I basically did the rosary but the<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>feeling did not
subside-but it did not feel evil. It was just very<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>oppressive.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Needless to say,
I was grateful when my mother in law sold the house and we<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>had to move.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>As an aside, I
grew up in Ridgewood, Bergen County and I think that it is<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>one haunted
town. There is something very evil in the cemetery across from<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Ben Franklin JR,
and I knew people who messed around with stuff that they<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>should not have
that stirred something up there. One night we were all<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>hanging out
across the street (by BFJH) and then I went home. I parked in my<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>parents garage
(I was 17 or 18 at the time) and for some strange reason, the<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>car backed
itself out of the garage and landed directly over a ditch. It was<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>like it had
perfectly aligned itself to go there. The high school is haunted<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>too. There used
to be a room off the auditorium in the tower that was always<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>10 degrees
colder than anywhere else in the school. Of course this is where<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>we would go to
smoke on a rainy day. There would just be a strange feeling<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>in there. I
don't know of any stories behind the building, it just might be<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>a natural energy
field or something.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Finally, I used
to work at the Borders in West Windsor. The shopping center<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>that the store
is located in was built over swampland where a bunch of kids<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>from Trenton had
drowned on Christmas night when they were fleeing police in<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>a stolen car.
The accident happened around 10 pm at night. Apparently, where<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>the backroom in
the store is was not too far away from where the accident<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>happened. There
were many times we would hear things outside at night on the<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>loading dock. Of
course, when we would open the door, there would<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>be...nothing. A
lot of times, especially after 10 pm, it would be very<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>creepy going
back there. I know that some other employees said that they had<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>seen things back
there. I never saw anything, I just got weird feelings.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>I've never
really shared any of these stories with anyone before, but I feel<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>like you guys
wont do anything to exploit them (or make fun of me!!)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>In 2002 or 03 i
was staying at my boyfriends house now my boyfriends family is half tongan and
half samoan his mother (who is tongan) is very religious and a strong believe
of the spiritual world. She would love to always tell me about what things ghosts
are attracted to which i will outline now such as leavig your hair out at night
attracts ghost to come and play with your hair thats why in the morning your
hair ends up in knots (i always tie my hair so that never happened to me) but
she always had a fear of mirrors at night she would make sure that the first
thing she did before going to bed was cover her mirror with a blanket. Anyways
one night i was angry at my boyfriend because he went down to the local pub and
left me to my own devices his parents were upstairs in bed and his sister was
also asleep so i was all alone in his bedroom which always tended to be quiet
cold at night. His bedroom was located next to the staircase. Anyways his
mirror was positioned right infront of his bed where i was sitting. I felt this
weird sensation and i lost my mind just sitting there staring at the mirror now
what happened i can not explain what possesed me or anything i still dont know
why the following happened and my boyfriend is in much awe as i am. After about
i dunno how long passed i picked up a pin that was sitting right infront me
which wasnt there earlier..i started to dig it into my skin carving the word
pain and slashing away at my left arm.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Now i can tell
you so much as i did not feel any pain<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>but during the whole process i was staring at myself i remember seeing
myself do these things but i couldnt control my boday AT ALL...Around 3am (this
was going on for a couple of hours time was of no essence so i dont really know
how long) my boyfriend came home and i remember he went to the kitchen (i heard
him) so i got up and moved to the kitchen stood next to me at this point i had
stretched out my badly bruised and scratched arm and was staring at him he
dropped whatever he had in his hands and grabbed me and started to shake me i
just felt something in my head click and i started to wail and ball my eyes out
he took me to the room and started to shush me and told me be quiet or ill
attract spirits he somehow calmed down but i was still teary but i wasnt being
loud anymore when all of a sudden the room got really cold i was under the
blankets but i could still feel how cold it was my boyfriend had turned off the
lights and he was about to climb into bed when he stopped he covered my head
and i could hear the fear and panic in his voice and i could also feel him
shivering as if the room had just turned freezing ice cold.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>He got up and
said &quot;You stupid bitch i told you to f** off and never to return&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>He covered the
mirror and when he layed back down he was still shivering and covered in
goosebumps he totally conked out at that point (he had not been drinking that
night due to medication he was taking) i was so scared to go to sleep i ended
up sleeping with the lights on...anyways in the morning i asked him what happened
and his mum was there he said that he saw a woman in a white dress in the
mirror she had red eyes and long flowing white hair she was staring at me and
he told me she had visited him once before. His mum turned to him and told us
that that was the same woman that had possessed her a couple of years
ago....which is a whole other story!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>clairovoyant
abilities, my parents being able to control it. My<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>littlest sister
is exceptionally 'powerful' for her age, she can see<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>things from time
to time that no one else can. My other sister's<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>getting on to
adolescence and she doesn't really tell much about what<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>she can do. As
for me, I see things from time to time but usually I<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>just hear voices
calling out to me from nowhere. If you think I'm<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>lying, then
ignore this altogether.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>No one in the
family has ever been stupid enough to play with ouija<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>boards. We've
had no real problem with ghosts in the past despite a<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>couple deaths in
the family. Anyway, I'll shut up now.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Our house isn't
too special. It's not built on holy ground/cemeteries<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>or anything like
that. As far as we know, no one's died in it and<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>there's nothing
to suggest that it could be haunted - and it's not.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>However, things
do come and go - spiritual energy of some kind is just<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>attracted to my
family, mostly my youngest sister. She wakes up in the<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>night and sees
shadows moving through the house. And no, nothing<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>causes those
shadows. I've seen them a couple times and my other<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>sister has too.
One night one of them (siblings) was walking down the<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>hall when she
looked in the mirror and saw the shape of a woman<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>wearing a hood.
A second later the other sibling saw the shape running<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>through her
room. I often hear footsteps running up and down the steps<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>outside my
window too fast to be human or animal. One day I was home<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>alone and as I
walked down the hall I glanced up at the mirror and saw<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>someone walking
behind me. He wore glasses and black clothes with<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>nothing special
about them. His hair was blonde and spiky, nothing too<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>gory or gross
there. I spun round and there was no one there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Then there are
the nightmares. My Dad's woken up to sense something in<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>the room with
him. He's seen shadows standing beside the bed. I've<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>done that too.
And no, it's not sleep paralysis - we can move our<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>bodies, you
can't do that in paralysis. I have the worst nightmares, I<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>often dream of
being attacked and I wake up with scratches all over my<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>body. We have no
pets aside from goldfish (and I somehow think they<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>don't scratch),
no one could've done it to me (no sleepwalkers) and I<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>couldn't have
done it to myself (short fingernails).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>The biggest
experience we've had is just outside the basement. My<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>sisters are all
deathly afraid of going down there. I am too, but it<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>doesn't stop me.
One day one of them (the elder of the two) was just<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>outside of it
with me. We were sitting there chatting away when it<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>suddenly felt
cold - very cold. We began to follow it round the room<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>when it
physically grabbed my arm and began to push it in the<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>direction of the
basement. We ignored it and sat back down. A second<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>I've always
experianced feelings &amp; presences of ghosts ever since I was little.
Sometimes I just get a feeling like I'm being watched, and other times it's
kind of threatening. But no matter what kind of feeling, I get them everywhere.
<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>This summer, I
went to Australia. While there, my group went to Capricorn Caves. We went into
the Cathedral, which was used as a church by the original owners to be wed in.
At one point, our guide turned off all the lights. That was when I first felt
the presence in the room. It was far from frightening. It had more of a happy,
contented feel to it. Later, when the lights came back on, I took a picture
with my digital camera. It wasn't until about 2 or 3 weeks ago, when I was
looking back over my pictures, did I see I had got an orb! It kind of freaked
me out, so right away I called my mom, who lives in California. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>I also had an
experiance with the supernatural when I went on a ghost tour of San Francisco
with my mom. The tour went to places such as the Queen Anne Hotel, several
ships that are claimed to be haunted, and several other places. In one room on
the ship, the room where they held some of the nuclear weapons, I think, I got
an orb in a picture. In the same picture, if you zoom in, there is a silhouette
of a man squatting down. For some reason I didn't feel much in there, but something
bad must have happened there. We also got a bunch of orbs at the Queen Anne.
Later on in the tour, in one of the richer parts of the city, we also got about
3 orbs in the same picture. We zoomed in to one, and we could make out the face
&amp; torso of a little girl in early 19th century-style clothing. These
pictures were also taken with a digital camera.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>My first
&quot;ghostly&quot; experiance was when I was in the 4th grade. We had been
experiancing things we couldn't explain, like doors opening by themselves &amp;
lights going out. One day when me &amp; my friends were changing after PE, the
lights went out when nobody was near them. We all ran to the door and tried to
pull it open. It wouldn't budge! It was one of those doors that you push to get
into from the outside &amp; pull from the inside. The outside of the door had
nothing that another person could pull on to keep the door from opening. It
took about 8 of us to finally jerk the door open. In my rush to get out of
there, I forgot my gym clothes. But the next day they were in my backpack. None
of us talk about that day because it was so scary. Maybe it doesn't seem too
terribly bad, but were were 9 and scared crapless! Even though I've felt dozens
of presences, seen the supernatural in pictures, and experianced the effects of
ghosts, my first sighting was a little over a year ago. Right now I'm an 8th
grader at Ector Jr. High in Odessa, Texas. The school is hau ed by a janitor
who killed himself and a girl who died while going there. Ector's in the
Haunted Places Index on your site, also. The janitor haunts the auditorium, but
the girl haunts the fieldhouse, where the girls like me that are in atheletics
practice &amp; work out. So about mid-October last year, after our workout, we
were going into the locker room. I don't know why, but I looked up in the
bleachers &amp; there was a mist in the shape of a person standing there! I
only saw it (her?) for a split second before I freaked &amp; hauled through the
locker room door, but I saw her turn her head. I was pretty damn scared, but
all the 8th graders said that you could only see her when it was pitch-black in
there. But I saw her in broad daylight! I was a little undecided at first, but
even though I only saw her for a second, I couldn't deny that I had most likely
seen a ghost.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>My school isn't
the only place I've seen ghosts. I kind of believe my house has its own
friendly ghost now. My house was built only about 3 years ago, and we're the
only ones who have ever lived in it. But there was a house that was on the same
exact spot for years, I don't know how long exactly, and I think that its a
ghost that is connected to the property or the ghost of my dog, who
dissappeared like 4 months ago and most likely got hit by a car. Once I needed
my calculator so I could finish my algebra homework. It wasn't where I was
positive I had put it, so I looked everywhere for it. After looking in every
possible place it could be, I finally said &quot;Can I please have my
calculator back?&quot; I said it jokingly, but when I turned around it was right
where I had looked moments before. Of course, I had also been known to loose
tater tots that were in my other hand all along. But something happened just
yesterday that I think proved we have a ghost. I was sitting watching TV when I
looked over by the counter. I saw a mist again, but this time it was shapeless
&amp; p; floating. There was no candle burning in the house at that time. Also,
last night, it was pretty cold in my room so I piled on 2 extra blankets on my
bed. In the middle of the night, I woke up from a really wierd dream, and I was
trying to go back to sleep when suddenly the temperature dropped in my room. It
only lasted but a few minutes, but the entire time I could feel something
watching me, like it was right above me. I have a loft bed, and I have to climb
a ladder to get up there. There's no way you can climb the ladder without it
creaking, so there's no way one of my brothers could have been there. If there
is something in my house, it isn't threatening us in any way. Hopefully it's
just a restless earth-bound spirit who enjoys playing harmless pranks on
people!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>I've always had
an interest in the paranormal, but so far these are the only experiances worth
telling. My friends have had much more activity with the other side than me.
Maybe I'll tell their stories sometime, or they can. But I guess that's it for
me for now.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

put them back in the most obvious places that you know<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>you've looked..<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Well, one night
while I was doing my homework I heard this moaning.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>And being 7 was
kinda like what the heck is that?? So I look out my<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>window where
there is a pathway to see, a white figure walking down<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>it- moaning.
I've never ran so fast in my life..<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>After that
experience not much happened besides the normal stuff<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>getting taken
and replaced until we had started to move our stuff into<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>the house that
was just getting finished and during this time my dad<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>remembers having
hammers and things he was working with disappear<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>while he just
turned his back for a second, it's like the ghost didnt<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>want us to go..<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>The about a year
or two later, after we were completely moved in and<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>the trailor was
sold, I was practicing my clainet in the sunroom one<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>night alone..It
was near Christmas time so, being about 10 at the time<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>was hacking
through Christmas Carols..I had just finished Jingle Bells<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>when from behind
me I hear &quot;Play it again&quot;, mind you I was alone (or<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>so I thought)
when I turned around to see my Oma, who had died earlier<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>that year..<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Besides that the
only other things that would happen would be the<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>closet light in
my room liked to turn it self on at different times of<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>the night, once
I remember hearing foot steps in the early morning<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>from the attic
(even though it's too small to stand in and full of<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>stuff) and my
brother also at the same time would tell me he heard<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>banging from the
attic coming from one specific corner..<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>These things
seemed to stop happening when I was 12 and my brother 10..<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>But of course
that couldn't just be that..<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>As I started to
get older my parents stopped requireing our nieghbor<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>to come over and
look after me and my brother after school, and a lot<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>of the time it
was just me home alone. I still still played the<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>clarinet, even
after my biggest fan my grandfather died when I was<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>13.. I learned
quickly however that when I played my clarinet home<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>alone I felt
nothing but being &quot;watched&quot; it was a comfotable feeling,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>so I dont know
how to explain it, I always like to think though that<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>it's my grandpa
coming back to listen to me practice, because he lived<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>to hear that
clarinet..<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>So everything
seemed to be calming down experience wise when just last<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>year my brother
and I switched rooms because I wanted a smaller<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>one..and I had
told him that &quot;just so you know the closet light turns<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>on every now and
then&quot; and he did laugh<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>it off
because, hey he's 15<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>now and a tuff
guy..well about a week ago he goes to me &quot;you know, the<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>other night I
woke up and the closet light was on, and I KNOW it was<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>off whenI went
to bed..&quot; and I laughed because obviously the ghost<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>came back for a
visit..Until a few nights ago it seemed like that was<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>the last
experience, when I was laying in bed falling asleep when I<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>heard the
banging coming from the same corner up in the attic in that<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>same specific
corner.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>hey...im Dani
and i live in Bloomington Illinois. i have a friend who visited Soldiers and
Sailors in Normal and saw some pretty crazy stuff. apparently they went and
videotaped. they didnt go inside....they simply sat outiside in their car. it was
winter and there was snow all over. well my friend was videotaping, and he said
that when he looked through the camera...it was differnt then when he wasnt
lookin through it. through the camera...it wasnt snowy. there were tress all
over and a huge field that reportedly was there around the time it was built.
he saw the building...brand new. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>there is this
car that is parked right outside of the building...an old car. through the
camera it was brand new...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>so my friend put
the camera down. he looked through the window of the 2nd floor. there was a man
standing in a top hat. just looking.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>so he looks
picks up the camera and videotapes. then he looks over to the field again.
reminder: theres no snow... through the camera. well there was this little
girl. all dressed up. in a white frilly skirt and she was playing with a dog in
the middle of the field. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>again my friend
films it then turns the camera towards the building...well through the camera
he saw headlights coming at him he kept videotapin and it was the car that sits
in front of the building....he puts the camera down and looks up- everything
was back to &quot;normal&quot; but headlights were still coming at him. so he
books out of there. drives down to shelbounre dr. which is really close.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>after awhile
hedecides to go back....so he does. doesnt notice anything else when he gets
there but looks over to the field. without the camera...he sees the little girl
playing in the snow. which a white light surrounding her. he looked back to the
building and the man in the tophat was outside...so he decided hed better go
back home.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>so a few weeks
pass. they still had the tape. everything on it. well they showed it to a
coupld of their friends.they watched it and all the sudden one of the guys just
passed out. then he got back up after a couple seconds. his eyes were blackened
out...and he went over to my friend and started choking him. he wouldnt let go.
it took 6 guys to get him off of him. then he just stopped. and was back to
normal and didnt know what was going on. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>there were cuts
from this guys nails on my friends neck. but there were also bruises from
behind. but there was no one behind him....<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>so my friend
decided to burn the tape...they did and they dont have it anymore although i
wish they did.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>so my friend did
some research on Soldiers and Sailors. he didnt find much. but he found out
that the ONLY living survivor of the children that lived there... is now in
some mental hospital in new york i believe.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>my friend told
me he would never go there again even if his life depended on it. weeks after
he went there for the first time he would wake up in the middle of the nite in
cold sweats....<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>so i thought
this mite interest you. im planning to go to Soldiers and Sailors in the
spring....with a camera.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>thanks for your
time <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>A couple of
years ago, my brother-in-laws best friend was killed in a car accident.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My oldest niece was four years old at the
time and my sister and brother-in-law explained to her and my other niece that
Johnny had gone to be with Jesus.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>A couple of days
after the funeral, my nieces were having snack  these little peanut butter
sandwiches with the crusts removed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My
sister was for some reason feeling a little uneasy and she kept thinking about
her dead friend.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She chalked it up to
normal grieving.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She was just starting
to clean up the kitchen when her daughter started talking to apparently no
one.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is a pretty normal occurrence
because she has a couple of imaginary friends.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>All of the sudden she looks at her mom and
asks well arent you going to give Johnny Bravo a sandwich?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So my sister starts explaining again how
Johnny is now with God, but my niece just rolls her eyes and says No mom, hes
sitting right here.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>A couple of days
after that, my niece asked if they could walk to the football field to watch
her dad coaching.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Since it was a nice
day out, my sister agreed, loaded up the girls in the wagon and started
walking.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>To get to the football field,
you have to pass by the graveyard.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As they
were going by it, my niece asked if they could go to Johnnys grave.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My sister didnt think that they would be
able to find it, so she told her daughter so, but agreed to try to find it.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Well, she found it by accident and they stood
there for a few minutes.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Mom, my niece
said, Johnnys not here.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Her mom
agreed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My sister stood there for a few
more minutes saying a prayer for Johnny.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>My niece walked over to a statue of Jesus nearby and when my sister went
to get her to leave, she seemed to be listening to someone.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She was nodding and even answering as she
looked up at the statue.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When my sister
was right by her, my niece turned to her and very seriously told her Everything
is all right now.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Johnny is with Him now<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Now, you can say
that all of this is just a childs imagination, but my niece has always seemed
to know things that she shouldnt. I think that maybe Johnny was confused after
his death and couldnt move on right away.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>But he found his way to God, and somehow my niece knew.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>I have been
blessed or cursed, however you want to call it, to see &amp; feel spirits since
I was a little girl.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I have been pulled
off furniture, spoke face to face with two spirits, been sitting on a couch
Indian style &amp; the couch was lifted off the floor twice.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That is just to name a few things. Just about
every place I have lived has had a spirit in it.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>At one point I could ride down the road &amp;
tell where someone had passed away.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I
got tired of the weird looks from people when I talked about it so I kind of
put it on a back burner.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I can still
feel spirits around me when they are around but I am now interested in
contacting them.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I am stand offish about
this part because I dont want to step in a realm.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Anyway, the house I live in now is haunted
&amp; my kids hear the footsteps as I have also &amp; had the sense of being
watched.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I finally met someone thru
family that sees spirits &amp; wants to bring me along on a haunting
lesson.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There is a grave yard in my town
that is really old &amp; has a long history of being haunted.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It is called Montrose Graveyard in Darlington
County, SC.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He told me it would take about
1 hour to tell me who was haunting my house &amp; I am really excited about
it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When my daughter was born, she was
fully veiled &amp; last year she informed me that she remembers being born.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She explained the whole thing to me.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was accurate to according to what I
remember b/c I didnt have any pain killers &amp; went into a semi shock.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Anyway, it was while I was pregnant with her
that I had something strange happen just about everyday. Hearing babies cry, a

at the time.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Because I had things happen

months apart.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Since I was small, I've always
been told how much I resemble my grandmother by those who knew her.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I was even named after her (my middle
name).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I've always been told by my
parents how much I would have been spoiled by them if they had lived to see me
and even though I never knew them, I feel a void by not ever having had them in
my life (physically).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>My Mom has told
me this story several times, and each time I hear it I listen intently like it
was the first time she's ever told me.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Right after I was born (maybe I was a few days old), my Mom had gone
into my nursery to feed me.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As she
approached my crib, she was overcome by the scent of my departed Grandmother's
perfume (she always wore Evening in Paris).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It was intoxicating she said, just like my Grandma was standing right
there by my crib.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My Mom went out of my
nursery in disbelief, came back in and picked me up from my crib and ran out of
the room quick.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She said she was never
scared, just in shock because she knew that my Grandma had just come to see her
new granddaughter!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>On my 11th
birthday, my Mom had gone into our family room to get my birthday gift she had
left on the rocking chair that she had bought when she was pregnant with
me.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Again, she said<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>she was overcome by the scent of my Grandma's
perfume.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Like before, she said she was
never scared, just in shock!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>When I gave
birth to my daughter, I was in the hospital bed waiting to go home.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The nurse had brought my daughter in the room
about an hour before, and as I was sitting in my bed I was all of the sudden
immersed in the scent of perfume.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>No one
had come into my room for at least an hour and the door had been almost
completely closed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I remember smelling
my hair thinking it may be from my shampoo or maybe from my lotion but neither
matched the scent that was around me and my daughter.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was overwhelming.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I called my Mom in a panic because I just
knew who and what it was.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>After hearing
my Mom's stories, I knew it was my Grandma coming to see her new
great-granddaughter.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I've never had
another experience like it but am so glad to know that she visited us both.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

be of Native American ground. The reason why the college was able to be built
in this location was because the Governor at the time--Pierce-- did some
illegal transactions to get the property. It was far enough back in history
that things like that could happen and there weren't any Federal laws that
really cracked down on situations like that. Under the main building, Inlow,
there is a walkway underneath the building where there are unearthed bodies.
The bodies are still there to this day. The<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>bodies are directly under the main staircase in Inlow. There are other
buildings built on top of the old cemetary-- Hunt Hall (dormitory), Pierce
Library, and Ackerman Hall. There is an estimated 40 bodies still buried
throughout the campus. Also, there is a casket buried directly under the bell
outside of the entrance of Inlow. Hunt Hall is said to be haunted, as well as
Dorian Hall (dormitory), but for different purpo!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

that the girl's side third floor is haunted. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>Although there
is a lot of information on Hot Lakes Hotel, we have a personal story. We went
late one night and parked at the gate (since we can't trespass). It was winter,
so the steam was thick. But, through the steam we could see the lights on in
the bottom floor of the building. We were standing there and saw a figure in
the middle window. It appeared to be a bust of someone/something rocking back
and forth-- maybe in a rocking chair? It was not a clear figure-- just kind of
grey. We got back in the car and then, all of a sudden, the lights flashed
except for the window where the figure was seen. Needless to say, we drove
really REALLY fast out of there!!!!!!! It was creepy as hell.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'><span

got divorced when I was very little, I was like 4. I didn't speak to my mother
because of stories that got told to me about all the bad things she had done
and all that stuff. I finally started talking to my mother when I was about 10.
I moved in with her when I was 17. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>All my life I
have had the ability to &quot;communicate&quot; with things beyond this world.
Psychic abilities, tarot card readings, communicating with ghost or spirits,
seeing them and other things. There have been very few times that this scared
me. The first couple of times I was a little spooked, but after realizing that
it just comes naturally I got over it. I have many, many, many stories that I
would love to share with you guys. I am 18 years old and I would say I heard
and saw my first spirit when I was about 8 or 9, so I have been accustomed to
extra-ordinary things for a while now. I am going to tell you a story about my
mothers house.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>This was her
third husband, and probably the only one I like thus far, besides my dad. He
bought her a brick house in </span><st1:place><st1:City><span style='font-family:

style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>. It is beautiful. For the first couple
of weeks I lived with them there wasn't anything to out of the ordinary, little
noises hear and there, that if needed, could be explained by trees or noises
from outside. The thing that really caught my attention was the man at the end
of the bed. I had a full size bed, that was covered all the way around by a
see-through bluish-green canopy attached to the ceiling. I don't sleep well at
night, so it was no surprise to anyone that is was about </span><st1:time
Minute="30" Hour="14"><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>2:30</span></st1:time><span
style='font-family:Arial;color:white'> in the morning when I saw him. I wasn't
scared of him, but I was was scared of his facial expression and the fact that
he was clutching something, very tightly in his hand. I couldn't see what it
was because whatever it was was hidden by the foot board, I could only see that
his knuckles were a paler white and it looked as if he were tightening and
loosening his grip on it. .Kind of like baseball players do to their bats. He
was just standing there staring at me. The look on his face was angry. I had
the feeling that maybe he didn't want me to be there. I couldn't move though.
We just stared at each other for, I would say about 2-4 minutes then he turned
and walked out the bedroom door. That happened just about every night that I
lived there, except when I had certain friends over. It still happens to this
day when I visit my step dad and sleep in my old bedroom. My sister stayed over
there a couple of weeks back, she slept in my room. I asked her if she had seen
or noticed anything strange and she informed me that she hadn't seen anything
but she had noticed that the window that was locked when she went to bed was
unlocked when she woke up and the closet doors had been opened and some of the
clothes were lying on the floor. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>It was my usual
Saturday morning routine wash-up,dress, be happy and leave out for work. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;color:white'>And I was
happily leaving out for work that morning but when I was coming down the stairs
my mother was looking at the phone very upset. &quot;Who is that who keeps
calling you&quot;. &quot;I don't know.&quot; (What was she talking about? Man
mom's getting old and wierd). Why would Mom say that? Somebody keeps calling
me. What was she talking about. I thought about about that incident for a
little while and was hoping it would not happen again because I didn't want my
mother to be upset with me. The next Saturday I got up went through my same
routine and I had a little bit more time before work. So I had breakfast with
my parents and was getting ready to leave. As I walked out of the kitchen the
phone rang, I started not to answer it , my mother at this time was rushing out
of the kitchen and was standing some distance behind me. When I said
&quot;Hello&quot; a voice came over the phone It sounded like someone was
speaking from far away and yet here. &quot;Mommy, Mommy&quot;. My eyes grew big
and I didn't say anything I put the phone back on the reciever and turned
around towards my mother. &quot;You see, Who is that calling you&quot;. &quot;
I don't know&quot;. I left out for work and didn't know what to make of that.
But I know it wasn't a vioce that was &quot;present&quot;. That's why I told my
mom I didn't know who it was.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>This I do
know sometimes when no matter how long people have known me they always mistake

all &quot;Summer&quot; homes that people would rent or own and visit our
man-made lake during the 50's. The family that owned our home had a little boy
who unfortunately drowned in our lake when he was about 8 or 9 years old. Jesse

style='font-family:Arial;color:white'> the day we brought home our new son.
Jacob is our only son- and since we have brought him home- our stereo turns
itself on in the nighttime- lights turn themselves on and off at will, and I
can hear &quot;thumping&quot; on the baby monitor when Jake is asleep. The
strange thing is- all of this only happens in the room where Jake is. We both
feel strongly that this might be the ghost of the little boy somehow making
contact with our son. I have been a believer in the other world for as long as
I can remember- as my mother and myself have both had several premonitions and
dreams come true over the years. If this is the little boy- we are not scared
of him- only feel so bad that maybe he is wondering why his family left (after
he drowned- they never came back), and maybe he is searching for them. What a
fantastic website you have- and thank you for letting me share our story with
you and your readers. Keep up the good work!!<o:p></o:p></span></p>
