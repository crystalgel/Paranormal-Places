<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arrus BT">Psychic photography, also known as spirit
photography, is the single most important evidence&nbsp; an investigator
can have to support the claim of supernatural or preternatural presence
at a&nbsp; location. This is a technique widely used by researchers all
around the world not only to document a haunting but also to find one.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Psychic photography was first introduced in 1862 by William Mumler, a well
respected&nbsp; professional photographer in Boston. Upon developing the
plate the sitter, Dr. Gardner of the same city, was amazed at what he saw.
On the plate appeared to be a figure which closely resembled Dr. Gardners
cousin, a person who has been deceased for twelve years prior to the photo
session. Through this picture and the recognition given to it by Dr. Gardner,
who published his account excessively around the world, it was quickly
picked up by the spiritualist and used to support their beliefs.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Although many spirit photographs and psychic photographers were proven
to be fraud it was that small handful of pictures that were authentic,
or at least no trickery was found in them, that has enabled psychic photography
to still be researched and performed today.&nbsp;&nbsp; Theory of why Psychic
Photography works:</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arrus BT">Since this field of work is not an exact science
there are no right or wrong answers to why the phenomena of psychic photography
occurs, only theories. Although I have always tried to stay open minded
to other investigators opinions, I myself as an investigator have decided
to stick with one.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many investigators, including myself,
believe that spirits allow us to take their photographs, but&nbsp; not
because we were at the right place at the right time but because they let
us. What I mean by this is that when entering a haunted location you have
now become a target. Many spirits, after they have become familiar with
you, will decide if they want to communicate or not for whatever purpose
they might have, and sometimes the way they choose to express communication
is by psychic photography. They achieve this by implanting their image
onto the&nbsp; film bypassing the camera lens and directly placing it onto
the negative. We must remember that&nbsp; film is a very sensitive and
delicate material that is very susceptible to light, heat, magnetic, and&nbsp;
many other types of energy. Most of these sources are the same energies
that spirits utilize! See the connection?</FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arrus BT"></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arrus BT">How to perform Psychic Photography:</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arrus BT">As previously discussed, Psychic Photography
is not an exact science therefore there are no set rules for how and when
this should be attempted but by popular belief this is the best method.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
When arriving at the location that has been decided upon load up the camera
with the film, not before. Through this recognition the spirits will be
attracted to you. Then walk around the site for half an hour or so without
taking photographs. This will allow you to familiarize yourself with the
surroundings as well as letting the spirits get used to you, a very important
factor. Once you have done this you can now start taking photos. Chances
are that no entity is going to be that co-operative and just pose for you,
so here are a couple of signs you should be looking for</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arrus BT">that would indicate an opportune time to take
a shot.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arrus BT">1) When there is a temperature change in a
specific location.</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arrus BT">2) If an odor becomes present.</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arrus BT">3) If there is a feeling of being watched.</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arrus BT">4) If tiny sparkles appear when the flash
goes off.</FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arrus BT"></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arrus BT">Results of Psychic Photography:</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arrus BT">Many people believe when you take a psychic
photograph that you are going to end up with a full body apparition, that
is very rare. There are many types of ways that a spirit can appear but
a complete specter is unlikely. In this section we are going to discuss
the most common types of appearances in Psychic Photography.</FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arrus BT"></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arrus BT">Globules -&nbsp;&nbsp; These are the most common
of psychic photographs. They are spherical in shape and can be&nbsp; transparent
or translucent. Globules are mostly seen hovering over a specific grave.</FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arrus BT"></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arrus BT">Ghostlights -&nbsp;&nbsp; When a globular is
illuminated or has a distinct color it is known as a ghostlight. Ghostlight
are usually seen in multiples and sometimes within the camera flash when
photographing. They are also commonly known as sparkles.</FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arrus BT"></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arrus BT">Ectoplasm -&nbsp; Ectoplasm appears as a foggy
substance which can be seen fully on the photograph or&nbsp; concentrated
in one specific area. When evaluating a photograph which has ectoplasm
present&nbsp; look deep and you might be able to see appendages closely
resembling limbs of a body or even a&nbsp; face. Ectoplasm is also called
psychic fog or spirit energy.</FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arrus BT"></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arrus BT">Light Rod -&nbsp; The Light Rod appears in
a stick or bar like shape. This form sometimes will have a bend to it&nbsp;
which it is then referred to as a Swirling Light rod. When reviewing this
type of photo notice&nbsp; often there are globules present around or in
the rod.</FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arrus BT"></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arrus BT">Vortex&nbsp; -&nbsp;&nbsp; The Vortex is an
uncommon photo but when taken it’s a keeper. The Vortex appears as a&nbsp;
funnel shaped image similar to the Swirling Light Rod.</FONT></B>
