<p class="MsoNormal">A Small Frightening Encounter</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I re<st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName>y don't
like reliving this moment in my life but I saw the site and decided to tell
about it, mainly because I needed to get it off my chest. Back about 6 years
ago when me and my dad lived in a town house like home I had a weird thing
happen to me. I was only around 10 or 11 at the time and it was about 2 in the
morning when it happened. Ever since I was little I've always had sleeping
problems so I'm up <st1:PersonName w:st="on">all</st1:PersonName> hours of the
night, or at least that's how my dad put it. I was getting ready to go to sleep
and I turned the lights off in my room and went over to lay down in my bed. As
soon as I turned over facing my closet I noticed something strange. I had one
of those closets with the sliding doors and I had left one of the doors open,
well as I looked closer at the strange thing that caught my eye I squinted a
bit more and noticed it was a eyes staring back at me, but they were a dark red
color. I tried to get up from my bed to run into my dads room but I couldn't
move because I was scared that if I did whatever it was would get me. So I
closed my eyes and when I opened them back up it was still there, at that point
I didn't know what else to do so I screamed and about 2 minutes later my dad ran
into the room and turned the lights on, on his way in. I told my dad about it
and he says I was seeing things, however I know I wasn't seeing things, I saw
what I saw. Ever since that night I've never went to sleep or even turned the
lights off in my room before my closet doors were shut. Now me and my dad have
moved a few times but I still can't sleep with the closet doors open. Just the
memory of that night gives me the chills.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">From the time my son was able to look around and until he
was about 3 </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">1/1 to 4 years old, he saw people and animals that no one
else could see.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Many times he would play
with someone that no one else could see.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>One evening, we were all in the den (my husband, my son and myself) and
my son was playing and talking to someone in the corner of the room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For some unknown reason that night, it really
bugged me that he was playing with someone that no one else could see.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I asked him who he was playing with and was
told that he was playing with "Paw-paw".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Paw-paw" was my name for my
grandfather that had been dead for several years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I looked over to the corner of the room and
challenged my grandfather to prove it if he was really there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Paw-paw" used to love to act like
his nose was running and then he would make a big production of wiping the back
of his hand across his nose and then dry his hand on whoever happened to be
closest to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>J (my son) tried his
best to do the same thing after he received some instruction from his
playmate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then J had some further
whispered conversation with his playmate.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He came over to me, hugged and kissed me and then said "From
him."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I knew that he was relaying a
message from my grandfather about how much he loved me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A couple of years later, my aunt (my dad's
sister) and my grandmother (my mom's mother) died within a week of each
other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had a really hard time getting
over those events.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a religious
person, I had a hard time trying to understand why God allowed to such good
women to die so close together.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My aunt
always loved to sew.</p>




<p class="MsoNormal">One of the things that she always did was to put the pattern
pieces as close as possible together when you are cutting out a pattern - to
make the scraps as large as possible, in case you want to use them for something
else later on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have never been very
good at cutting out material and didn't like putting the pieces too close
together.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One evening I was cutting some
material out in the floor of our living room.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>J was playing in the den (right next door).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I wasn't paying much attention to what he was
doing when he came up to the gate I had put across the doorway between the two
rooms.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He told me that it wasn't
right.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I asked him what wasn't
right.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He stepped back from the doorway
and spoke to someone - like he was getting directions on what to say.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then he looked me straight in the eye (I was
down on my hands and knees crawling around in the floor) and told me that the
pieces weren't close enough.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You have to
understand that this was coming from a child who had just turned two - he
probably had never seen anyone to anything like, since I hadn't sewed in
several years and my aunt had been totally disabled before he was born.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was a great comfort to me to know that she
was looking over me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have heard people
say that anything paranormal or from the spirit realm is of "the
devil".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have to totally
disagree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All of the paranormal
experiences I have had in my life have been of great comfort to me - like when
my aunt came back and told me how to cut out material.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I don't understand why some people are
allowed by God to come for visits, but I know that it happens.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">This is my friends' story, really. But I couldn't even get
her to talk about it anymore.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">So I'll tell it myself. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Once my friend and me were outside, playing, and we were in
her yard. She has a tree in her yard and she likes to do a hand stand like,
right in front of the tree, and then she lands her feet on it. We call it the
flippy-thingy, because we're kids. Well, I could never do the flippy-thingy,
because I was too chicken. So I just sat beside her and watched. Once, while
she was upside-down, she got really scared and flipped back down. I asked her
what was wrong, and she told me that she saw a man in a black suit walking down
the road, and when she flipped off the tree, he was gone. That was last year,
and she still won't talk about it to this day.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">We started talking about our experiences with ghosts after
that. She believes that what she saw was her guardian angel. I believe that,
too. I don't believe in ghosts, and her experience doesn't change my mind. I
don't know if it changed her mind about it, but she seemed pretty freaked out.
She is my neighbor and close friend. We have been friends for over 4 years and
I believed her because of the way she was acting. She was definitely scared.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I won't believe in ghosts until I see one. My mother has
also seen one, but I will save that for another time.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Ok first of all my name is Ashley. I live in <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">California</st1:place></st1:State> I've had
encounters with 4 ghost. The fist time I had an encounter I was only 9 or 10. I
was sitting up late one night, getting ready for bed when this black shadow
entered my room. I only had a night light, so I thought it was my father coming
to tuck me in and say goodnight. Well this shadow walked to my closet and
disappered. I never told a soul untill right now. The second time I was a
sleep, I felt this heavy feeling laying on top off my chest. I tried to wake up
but my eyes would'nt open. I could hear a voice tell me "go back to sleep
it's okay" but I knew some how I must wake up that I have to open up my
eyes. Now Im not all that in to religion, but I do believe in God. I started to
pray asking for help. Then as soon as it started it stopped. The following
night I had a dream atleast I think it was a dream. I dreamed I was standing in
the light<span style="">&nbsp; </span>washing dish'es and beyond
where my couch was it was pitched black I felt that I had to stay in the light.
I dont know why but it felt safe, A voice with no body was trying to trick me
trying to get me to agree with it. I remember tell it no that it has to
leave.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It wanted something from me I
cant recall I told it in the Lords name it must leave and never bother me
again. I woke up that morning feeling like this weight was lifted of my
shoulder. Like there was this bounce in my walk that was never there before.
That second night it return as a nightmare it trapped me in a old house with a
gate for a door. I couldnt get out it was chasing me through the whole house I
remember being in the middle of the house near some stairs it was dark and I
was scared it had a black hood coat and I couldnt see it's face. I remember
asking God for help again. The windows in my dream flew open and this thing ran
in to the darkest part of the house away from the light. It never visited me
again.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The third time I've had an encounter I just got back from
out of state, I had no where to go so I stayed in a sheleter. Well from what I
can recall a man over dosed and had died. He was found 7 days later decompsing.
Well that night I was talking to a couple of people we startes talking about
the nights mishaps event. When a girl started joking around that he was going
to haunt all the rooms. Now me being 20 something and not scared of anything
said " Let him visit me I dont believing Ghost" well he visited me
and he was all mad as hell. I was laying down and I felt this hand very lightly
touch me on my side I was not asleep I was wide awake staring at the wall. I
turned around to look at the neighbor girl to see if she wanted something to my
surprise she was asleep, I brushed it of as my mind playing tricks from me
being so tired. So I closed my eye's and try to get some sleep, but I kept hearing
this voice. I turned to look around but no one was awake , just<span style="">&nbsp; </span>then the door swing open . I saw this head
only the head of the man who was suppose to be dead peeping behind the wall
that leads in the other room where 4 other girls sleep. I screamed waking up
everyone in the room. I couldnt sleep that night to scared and to ashamed that
I pee all over myself.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The fourth and last time I ever felt a prensece was when I
was working at a <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Animal</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Hospital</st1:PlaceType> out in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Conga</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Park</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>.
I was the last one in the kennel where the big dogs where kept when I got this
strange feeling like dread come over me, but I just kept working. Now all the
dog's were quiet cause I only had one light on. But then all of a sudden they
jumped up and some started to howl and other growled not thinking any thing of
it I just kept working rolling up the hose checking the water pipes making sure
everything was shut off for the night when this 5 pound metal pooper scooper
flew by my. I stop when I was doing stood up then felt real dizzy. I could hear
some one giggling so me pissed of asumed it was one of my co-worker playing a
prank. Turns out<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was the only one in
the kennel while the others where up front or out back smoking. I quit a few
days later after a girl strangled herself by having a leasing around<span style="">&nbsp; </span>her neck and getting caught on a cage door
that didnt open at all. Some strange things happen but hey thats life were not
the only was on this earth.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">This is not the first time I've told some one this, normally
people don't believe me because I'm only fourteen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But I swear that everything I'm about to say
is the honest truth.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My first experience happened six years ago, my friend was
sleeping over at mine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We couldn't
sleep, so we were just talking in the dark, well it wasn't that dark because I
had the curtains open.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I remember it
being a few minutes past midnight, I also remember thinking my friend had stood
up because there was a shadow on the wall opposite us, but she was still lying
down, but she too had seen the shadow, it no features and was only head and
shoulders, it was where my light switch was, we both looked outside to see if
any one was there, nothing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So we
started to really freak out and closed the curtains as quick as possible, and
when we reopened them a few seconds later it was gone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have no explanation for this, I defiantly
wasn&#8217;t dreaming and neither of us had imagined it.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Later on that year I was alone in the house watching a
video, I stopped the video to get some thing to eat down stairs, when I came
back the video had been took out from my video player and was on my bed.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My next experience happened about five maybe four years ago,
I was on the computer, and I was the only one in the house as my brother was
out and my mum and dad were out working, I didn&#8217;t have any music on at the
time, and the TV wasn&#8217;t on either, basically things were silent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I heard this voice, coming from down stairs
calling my name, it was defiantly a woman&#8217;s voice, maybe in her late twenty&#8217;s I
wasn&#8217;t sure at the time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I really
started freaking out, it lasted for round about five minutes then stopped, the
next couple of times I heard it really scared me, the last time I heard it was
I was home alone again, the TV was on mute and I was on the computer
again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The voice came from right next to me, it shouted my name in
to my ear, it shocked me so badly that I actually screamed so loud that the
people next door heard me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since then I
haven&#8217;t heard it, but recently I&#8217;ve been hearing music playing in and out side
of my house.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Also recently things keep happening in my room, like I keep
feeling cold spots, and a lot of the time I feel like I&#8217;m not the only one in
the room, it&#8217;s really scary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plus my TV
has been put on mute or changed channels when I&#8217;m no where near the remote it
scares me a lot, it&#8217;s shook me up s bad that I hate being alone in the house.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Hello from sunny <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Zambia</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I think the title of your website suites my 'experiences',
though some, you might find a little bizarre.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It actually began here in <st1:City w:st="on">Lusaka</st1:City> the
capital of <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Zambia</st1:place></st1:country-region>
back in 1983 when I was a young girl of 5.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For some reason I always woke at 3am on the dot whilst living in our
home at the time and found myself walking down the hallway.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We had security lights in the garden
therefore shadows would play off trees, bushes and windows onto the interior
walls of the house like a russian puppet show.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>With a security guard present each night I would think the shadowy shape
of a man appearing and disappearing suddenly was simply that, our guard doing
his rounds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It wasn't until one final
night after my usual check of the house I was walking back to my room when I
just felt something behind me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Wish I
hadn't because the shadowy figure of a man was right behind me, away from the
walls and lights but very distinctive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
was scared but to be honest looking back now cannot remember any feeling of
evil.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Just curiosity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A few months after I started experiencing
'visions'/'dreams'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I would start having
a dream of a little funny white man standing in my doorway looking at me with a
mean little grin on his face.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>then he
would walk off in the direction of my brother's room whereby I once woke up to
hear my brother screaming for our mum saying there was something in his
room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This experience happened only once
but the dreams of the little man continued.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When we moved to the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">UK</st1:place></st1:country-region>
in '86 my final experience with this little man occured one night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I heard my name being called from downstairs
but when I reached the top of the stairs from my bedroom looking down into
pitch black and feeling utter malevolence directed at me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I couldn't see anything but it was the same
sensation I had when dreaming of the little white man.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lets say at the age of 11 I had the good
sense not to investigate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After that I
stopped experiencing the little white man but feel I became susceptible to
other 'things' from then on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our house
in the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">UK</st1:place></st1:country-region>
is set on what was once the BeanOak Estate farm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is said that a mass grave of 1800's
cholera victims lies within the vicinity of our estate which could explain the
experiences and not just from me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our
cat would get spooked and my mother was terrified one night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Our cat:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Tosto, our
cat would suddenly sit up and stair at a corner of the room, or the doorway or
an armchair and suddenly start to growl and raise his hackles.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then he would move his head as though
watching something walk through the room.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It frightened me one night when he sat up from my lap and dug his claws
into my thighs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The growling reached a
crescendo as though he was going into battle with another tom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I got so spooked I left the room and went
upstairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Tosto had left via the catflap
into the night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He wouldn't come back in
till the morning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What really spooked me
most was this also happened during the day one february morning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I can handle nighttime frights because of the
sense of normality when the sun rises, but when you are invaded during the day
all your security is shattered.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My brother and I both experienced what is now termed sleep
paralysis at exactly the same time one night.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Both of us also witnessed just before a sudden flash of brilliant
blue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For two people of differing sexes
to experience at exactly the same time is disturbing and we still discuss it
today.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My other experience of sleep
paralysis was when I was fully awake.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Lying on my tummy reading a book on my bed I suddenly had the
overwhelming terror swamp me from my feet upwards and couldn't move.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then at the foot of my bed I could feel as
though someone was taking a step onto the mattress between both feet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I could finally move I turned around to
see an indentation of a foot where the sensation was.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>?</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Thank you for taking your time to read my experiences for
that is all I can call them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I did have
one other experience but it is too terrifying to write down and causes me fear
even to this day.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">This occurred roughly 20 years ago when I was 19 or 20, and
I was sleeping over at my boyfriends apartment in <st1:place w:st="on">Spring
 Valley</st1:place>, Ca. My boyfriend left for work by 4 a.m., and I was alone
in the apartment.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">This one morning after he left, I awoke on my back to a
heaviness in the room. It was still dark but becoming dawn. I looked to my
right, and standing next to me by the bed was this tall black shrouded shadow
entity. I was terrified. I could feel its presence surrounding me.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Then it spoke. I was lying there wide eyed and in shock. I
am still not sure how I heard it. Was it audible, or just in my head? The voice
was deep, and gruff. It asked, "What are you doing here?"</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I am familiar with some experiences with the paranormal,
just never had it been so terrifying. I closed my eyes and began the
"Lords Prayer". By the last words, "deliver me from evil,
amen.", the room had cleared. I felt the change immediately and when I
reopened my eyes, all was normal again.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I told my boyfriend later that day, and he thought it was
his deceased grandfather being curious. My boyfriends grandma was recently
staying with him, and she would tell him stories of the grandfather visiting
her.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Possible, I guess, but I still wonder what this black
shrouded entity was and what it's intentions were?</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The 3 Most Horrifying Nights of My Life</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Hi. I was browsing thru your site and decided to share one
of my experiences with you. It was sometime during the 2nd semester of ' 04
that I had been waking up at exactly 3am every night for about 2 weeks. I remember
one day I was really angry and was cussin my head off. That night I woke up at
3am as usual, but this time I heard whispers, I couldnt make out what they were
saying but it scared the hell outta me. I said a quick Our Father and Hail
Mary, and they went away. The next night I again woke up at 3am, and i heard
the same whispers only talking alittle louder ( but i still couldnt make out
what they were saying) Then i figured<span style="">&nbsp; </span>it
was the devil trying to bother me again, so i started to say another Hail Mary.
But as I was prayin the voices got louder and louder to the point where i
couldnt hear myself prayin. I started crying because I was soo scared! I
quickly turned the lights on and grabbed a rosary and a picture of Jesus; i
felt a whole lot better. Then the next night i woke up at the same time, and i
heard the same whispers but with an extra voice, a menacing laughter. Before I
went to bed I thought about how I was going to deal with the voices if it
happened again. I told myself that God was with me and that I shouldnt be
afraid. And so i wasnt as scared but the laughter did creep me out. Then I said
f*** off! Yea I shouldnt have done that, because right after that the evil
voice laughed so much louder and crazier than before, he was practicly screaming
in my ear! I got up and started crying real loud. My dad came in and asked what
was wrong, I told him about it. We prayed a rosary and afterwards he asked if I
wanted to go to confession and I said yea. Me and my family went that day and
since then i never heard voices or woke up at 3.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Hi, my name is Patty and I live in <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Kentucky</st1:place></st1:State>.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I have been touched by ghosts back in 1976. I had only been
married for about 2 months when I had my first notice of ghosts.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">You see I never believed in ghosts till then.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">It was around 6:30 am and I had been waken with someone
walking down the hallway of our doublewide. I opened the bedroom door and there
was no one there, so I went back to bed. The walking started again and I
thought it was my husbands cousin. He was an alcoholic, and he sometimes just
walked into our home.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">So I had told him to go back home, the footsteps walked
away.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The footsteps had came back again, this time tried to open
the door, then walked away, this went on 3 more times, the 3rd time, the door
swung open and this wind started going around the bed, I threw the covers over
my head, and clung on. I was very scared by then, I felt tugging on the covers,
I was not letting up on my hold. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">All of a sudden the wind stopped and I let go of the covers,
just then the covers went off my head and I felt something pull back my hair, I
felt calm then.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My 2nd time I heard ghosts, was around 2am and my dogs were
howling, some woman was banging on the door yelling for help, I got up and went
to the door and there was no one there, just then the banging started on the
front door, at the same time my step son had gotten up and got a pot of water
to throw on the dogs to shut them up, as I had opened the front door. I had
asked him if he heard the banging, he stated that it happens about that time
every year. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">but it only happened that one time.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Our cats at the time would be looking down the hallway and
growling with their hair on ends and hissing then running out the door.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Then in 1990, I had remarried in Al. I had my mothers mirror
hanging up in the hallway of our home, and I and my daughter used to feel some
sort of presence in the house. We used to hear footsteps but never seen
anything.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I hid the mirror and didn't hear the footsteps any longer.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I moved back to <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Ky.</st1:place></st1:State>
in 1999, and moved in with my father to help him after my step mother had died.
I started hearing old bluegrass country music being played, sounding like it
was on a old record player.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I was working 2nd shift and I didn't get home until 11:20
pm, after I had gone to bed I would hear this music, I would go to sleep with
it.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I later bought a dog, and she would sleep with my dad, one
night she had come running to my bed, running around my head and whining. I had
grabbed her and told what ever it was to leave her alone, I was trying to
sleep.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">About 2 months later, my dad and I had gone to my uncles
house for dinner, my dad wanted to stay there, so I went back home. I decided
to sleep in his bed that night due to the fact he had air conditioner in his
room, and it was hot. I had got woken up to someone walking in the kitchen, I
got up and there was no one in the house, so I went back to bed, next thing I
know the walking started up again, I shut off the ac and went back to my bed,
and went to sleep with the country music.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">When my step brother and his wife moved in with us, they had
to sleep in the livingroom, (where my music was coming from) the music had
stopped.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I don't have the exciting ghosts storied that most people
have, but this has happened and it has made me believe.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">When I had moved in with my fiance in 2003, we lived in a
home that was over 100 yrs old. We both had seen different sightings of ghosts,
so we knew they lived there, I believed they were his brother who had died
there back in the 70's and his father that had died there in 2002. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">But we used to see footprints in our carpet heading to the
wall, the floor would look wet, but it was dry.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">They never bothered us, we built our home in 2004 and moved
out of the old house, everytime I went to that house to get more of our stuff,
I would feel such sadness.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I would tell him(my husband by now) the house is sad.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">He had to tear the house down last year, so I don't know
what became of the ghosts.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Thank you for letting me write my story</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">For many years, I had a gray cat named Kitty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Kitty didn't like many people - she mainly
only liked me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She always slept up
against my legs at night - on the outside of the covers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She loved to be close to me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After she died, I was absolutely
miserable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I missed her so much.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After a few days, I started getting a glimpse
of her walking aroung the house out of the corner of my eye.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I didn't say anything to anyone for a
while.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One day, my aunt said that she
didn't realize that we had gotten another cat after Kitty had died.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I told her that we didn't have any cats or
any other pets for that matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was
absolutely convinced that she had seen a cat walk across the doorway in our
living room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One night just as I was
going to sleep, I felt Kitty jump up onto the bed and cuddle up against
me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I could feel her pressing against my
legs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I tried my best to convince myself
that it was just my imagination, but my husband felt her jump up onto the bed
also.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Over the years, she has gradually
stopped coming around us so much.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
still shows up whenever I am upset or sick.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I guess she just comes to comfort me, just like she did when she was
alive.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I would like to share a supernatural experience that
happened at <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Indian</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Mounds</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Park</st1:PlaceType>
in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">St. Paul</st1:City>, <st1:State w:st="on">Minnesota</st1:State></st1:place>.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">About <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Indian</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Mounds</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Park</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>:</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">This park is on Daytons Bluff in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">St. Paul</st1:place></st1:City> and has a fascinating history dating
back to the Hopewellian period. At least 16 burial mounds originally sat on the
high bluff. 19 more were located further down the bluff above Carver's Cave.
Today there are only 6 Mounds close to the edge of the bluff with a Scenic
Overlook area. In two of the Indian mounds were 8 stone cists. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Human bones were found in each cist and were accompanied by
grave offerings, including shells, perforated bear teeth, copper ornaments, and
a piece of hammered sheet copper, as well as the usual number of projectile
points. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Among the more startling discoveries was a skull covered
with red clay. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Nothing similar to this "death mask" had ever been
found by archaeologists in mounds or ancient graves.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">When my husband and I first met we didn&#8217;t have any money for
entertainment so we would often go to the Mounds Park Scenic Overlook to watch
the Eagles over the <st1:place w:st="on">Mississippi River</st1:place> and look
at the Downtown St. Paul skyline.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Sometimes we would meet friends there at night and have a
bonfire. It was at <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Mounds</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Park</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> my husband first
told me he loved me.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The night of our supernatural experience was in the summer
of 1992. It was really hot out so we decided to go to Mounds after midnight, we
brought a blanket and sat at the scenic overlook as usual.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">We laid there and talked some, mostly just looked at the
stars, and enjoyed the night. As we had just met, and were young, we were
rather touchy-feely, and one thing led to another&#8230;..</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">About 2:30 a.m. we both began to doze when the breeze
started, not strong, but enough to rustle the leaves on the trees, waking us
up. I felt compelled to look to the right toward the 1st Mound at the trees and
bushes that line the cliff. I pointed to the brush about 4 feet away from us
and said &#8220;Look&#8221;.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">In the rustling leaves a very tall figure formed, first the
outline, the leaves moving and creating more and more definition slowly to
materialize into an Indian man made of leaves!</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">This Indian had many layers of clothing leggings, and a
blanket over his shoulders. On his head there was a hood or something that
resembled an animal, maybe a wolf or bear. He was holding something in his
right hand that was very long.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">His face was perfectly defined, and was looking directly at
us with very serious eyes.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">We stared at the green leaf Indian while he stared at us
until we couldn&#8217;t stand it. There was a rising feeling in both of us, like an
energy..&#8230; It felt like something was about to happen&#8230;..</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My husband broke the tension and said &#8220;we should go&#8221;,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I said &#8220;I think he&#8217;s the Guard of The
Mounds&#8221;.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">While we were leaving we kept an eye on the Leaf Indian who
shifted and turned his head to watch us until we were out of site.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">We still go to <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Indian</st1:PlaceName>

encounter with one, but my grandmother has told me about her brothers.It was a
long time ago,(i don't know the exact date)and it was a small time after her
mother's death. Her 2 brothers Art and Kenny both saw a spirt of their
mother.They each had a diffrent story.Kenny's was that it was right after
they(art&amp;kenny)have been playing in mud(Art's face was muddy.)they went
inside.He needed to use the restroom and so he went upstairs to the bathroom my
grandma said his face was white and he was very cold. He was scarred. When they
asked why, he said "i saw mom." They went upstairs to look, and found
nothing, but a hung up towel, Art would NEVER hang anything up. They were
suprised. The second one might be a little more scarry. Kenny was walking to the
star case, when he saw a figure. It was in the window. It was a woman, as he
got closer, he saw it was his mom. The mother moved her head toward Kenny, she
began talking. She never told me the words of what she said, but I do belive
that they saw her. I find ghosts(or spirts)strangly neat, because they are said
to take more than one form.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I went to what was then St. Mary's Academy my freshman thru
senior years and I graduated form St. Mary's. There are 2 buildings. The newer
building which I think was built in the 50's and is on the south end of the
property closest to the parking lot we refered to as the "new
building" and the other to the North and closer to Oklahoma Ave. we
refered to as the "old building" which I believe if<span style="">&nbsp; </span>my memeory serves me was built in the late
1800's and the school was once a boarding school. When we were there at night
the entire "old building" as we referred to it, just was not right.
At a spring concert one May, we saw a light moving up the staircase in the
"old building" like someone was holding a lantern. There was not
supposed to be anyone in that building at the time. We were viewing this form
the "haunted" theatre, which you have on the website I am viewing.
That same night we (there were 3 of us) went down to what was the cafeteria,
located in the old building, and we were at the soda machine when we heard
footsteps coming toward us. We thought for certain we were going to get
caught(as we were not supposed to be there) when the footsteps just stopped,
about 4 feet from the doorway to the soda machine room. All 3 of us poked our
heads out from the soda machine room after a time as there had been no
additional movement and there was no one there. We looked at one another, took our
high heels off and ran like hell back to the new building. In the basement of
the new building there is said to be an entrance to a set of tunnels that were
used during the Underground Railroad movement during the Civil War. During my
time there, which was the late 80's,early 90's, the basement to the school was
chained and locked off to us girls due to "safety reasons". At the
time the girls who had been at the school the year prior to my arrival, which
included my cousin, used lockers in the basement and there were so many
unexplained things happening such as footsteps, locker's being open that were
closed the night before, etc. that that is why the basement was closed off. If
you walk in the small "connecter"/"hallway" between the old
and new buildings you can clearly hear it is hollow underneath the floor. It is
on my list of things to do to find out as much as I can about the property, and
I would love to go back to my old highschool and be free to explore. The
education and the staff at the school were absoultey first rate and I have the
highest regard for the school. It is a shame it was shut down. As I sit here
there are more stories and personal expirences that come to mind. The 3rd floor
of the old building is of interest. The entire "old building" is
interesting. There was a chapel on the 3rd floor and as I said before tthe
school used to be a dormatory also, and there was talk of a boarding student
who died there. If you would like further information please contact me. Also
if you were to gain permission from the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Marian</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Center</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>
to do an investigation I would very much like to be a part of it. I have so
many unanswered questions. That school affected me deeply and to this day I
still have dreams about the school. I guess someday I was meant to go back
there. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">For the life of me I cannot remember the name of the
cemetary even though I pass it often. Its located in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">South Walpole</st1:City> <st1:State w:st="on">Massachusetts</st1:State></st1:place>.
I have a friend buried there. I used to go there in the middle of the night to
visit him. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Well, his grave of course. One night, in 1993, I was there
about 2 am. I was talking to his grave when I heard leaves rustling. (It abuts
woodlands) I looked up and saw this neon green "thing"....It had no
shape, but it was running towards me. Every step I took back it took two
forward. I ran to my car and locked the doors, my ex husband was still standing
in the same spot, not able to move. I put my fingers in my ears pretty sure
this was the end of things. After what seemed like ages, my ex hopped in the
car, we drove home and never, ever spoke about it again. Of course I havent
been back. I am considering taking a drive out this afternoon just to get the
name of the cemetary, but even the thought of it makes my stomache turn...........

<p class="MsoNormal">Like a lot of people I have had friends and family members
pass away.One of my best friends was John, who died from pancreatic cancer
while still in his early thirties.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Many years later,I started a habit while praying. I ask God
to help me to always remember my friends and family who have passed away, who
influenced me,and who were a big part of my life. Then I think of their names
and say them silently in prayer. About a year ago our friend and family priest
passed away,and I attended the funeral mass. As I was kneeling in the pews, I
felt someone beside me. I looked to my right and there as plain as day was
John! He was there for only 2,maybe 3 seconds and then disappeared, and where I
saw him it looked as if there were stars falling.I shook my head and looked
again, but he was gone.I had not thought about John at all that day,and I may
never know why he decided to show himself. I know that God puts people into
your life for a reason, and now I know that even after they are gone they are
always with you.I love you Brother! Thanks for the visit!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Hello - I grew up in an old apartment building in the
Fordham Hill section of the <st1:place w:st="on">Bronx</st1:place>. When I was
about 14 years old, I was speaking on the telephone to my best friend, who
lived upstairs on the fifth floor of the building. My apartment was on the
second floor. my friend said that she was going to come down to my apartment in
a few minutes. As soon as I hung up the telephone, there was a knock on the
door. I wondered how my friend could have possibly made it down three flights
of stairs so quickly, as we hung up the phones that second. I went to the door
and looked out of the "peekhole" to see if it was her. There at the
door stood a tall, young looking man, wearing a ruffled white shirt, a thick
black belt, black pants and black boots that went almost to his knees. Hanging
from the side of his belt was a sword or saber. As I stared at him, it appeared
as though he was looking right at me with peircing blue eyes, even though the
door was between us. I then noticed that I could see the number on the
apartment door across from mine through his shirt. I quickly ran from the door
realizing what I had seen, thouroughly frightened and called my friend asking
her to hurry and come down as I was alone in the house. I will never forget it
as long as I live. I did some research and learned that there were
revolutionary war battles on and aroung Fordham hill. I came to the conclusion
that the ghost was a revolutionary war soldier, probably British from the
clothing. I only wish I could learn more, nothing occurred for the rest of the
time that I lived in that apartment. Thanks for having a great site where
people can share their experiences! </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">When my parents first moved to <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Oregon</st1:place></st1:State>, they bought a house from a recently
widowed woman. She needed a smaller place. But apparently, her husband had no
intention of leaving his house to strangers. By the time I joined them a year
later, they were aware that they were not alone. Things would be found in odd
places, out of place, for no reason. One morning I got up to find that every
single glass lampshade had been turned upside down. (They were dusty, but there
were no fingerprints or marks in the dust at all.) Things would go bump in the
night. Chandeliers would swing. Doors would rattle. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">One time I was standing in the hall talking with my dad.
There was a sliding door to the laudry room, which was tiny, from which there
was another door to the garage. There was a cat flap from the garage to the
outside. We had 2 cats, and sometimes they'd get stuck in the laudry room.
Suddenly, the sliding door to the laundry room started rattling violently. I
jumped, and my dad said, "It's just one of the cats." When he opened
the door, there was no one there. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Whenever I was the only one home, I never felt alone. I felt
OK in my bedroom, but I avoided the kitchen and living room at night. Sometimes
I felt like someone was standing very close behind me, and it gave me the
creeps. It was a family joke, we'd tease each other about being scared in that
place. I never told my boyfriend about it. He found out for himself one
night...But I'll tell you about that in a minute. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Our ghost went from playful to menacing. One night my mom
had just climbed back into bed after using the bathroom. Suddenly, someone very
close to her ear said, "SHHHHHHHHHHH!" She jumped up, thinking my dad
was playing with her, but he was sound asleep. She made the sign of the cross
and didn't close her eyes the rest of the night. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">One night my boyfriend spent the night on the living room
couch. (My parents were home.) In the middle of the night, his pillow was
violently wrenched from under his head, as he heard someone say, "Get out
of my house!" Disoriented, he thought it was my dad gone nuts, but there
was no one there. Everyone was asleep. When he told me about that the next
morning, I told him about our ghost. He said, "I prefer the ghost in my
mom's trailer. She just ignores us and goes on about her business in the
kitchen, like we're not even there."</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Hi, my names amy. let me just first start out by saying
although im not totally sure i believe in ghosts and spirits, im open to the
idea, and im very interested in the subject anyway. i have a story i'd like to
share, i'm actually not sure if this was paranormal or not, but i feel i need
to share it anway. a few weeks ago i went on vacation to <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Kennebunkport</st1:City>, <st1:State w:st="on">Maine</st1:State></st1:place>
with my parents. we stayed in kind of a different kind of hotel. it wasn's just
like one big building with hotel rooms, there were only a couple rooms, and all
of the doors to them were from the outside, im not sure if that makes sense,
its hard to explain, but ill get on with the story. the room we stayed in was
connected to an art gallery that was owned by the owner of the hotel. and
somewhere around there in the same building supposedly him and his daughter
lived there. there was a door inside my hotel room, i never opened it, but i
think it led to the art gallery. but anyway, a couple of nights while i was
there i heard weird noises. one night i could barely sleep cause i kept hearing
banging in the kitchen. i thought it was my mom, she usually gets up in the
middle of the night and snacks, but every time i looked nobody was there. and i
kept hearing noises, it went on for about 2 hours maybe. my dad suggested it
was the people who owned the hotel next door. but it seems a little weird to me
they'd be up at 2 in the morning which was when i heard these noises, and the
noises sounded like they were in the room, it sounded like pots and pans
banging together. the room had two stories and my parents slept upstairs, so maybe
thats why they didnt hear anything. and one more thing, a couple of times while
i was taking a shower i thought i heard someone in there, moving stuff around
or something, every time i looked nobody was there. like i said, im not sure if
this was paranormal or not. i just wanted to share it because it was odd, and i
believe in the possibility that it was supernatural.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">My Own Experiences</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: mistress_gunslinger@hotmail.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I've been reading a few of the personal accounts on the
Shadowlands site, and thought I'd share some of my own.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I've always considered myself a little more sensitive than
most when it comes to spirits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I've
always seen shadowy figures others don't notice, heard voices when there was no
one else around, and always had odd feelings about certain places that no one
else seemed to understand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The odd thing
is, there have only been 3 occasions where I have experienced things in places
people told me were "haunted", and on only one of those occasions did
I actually see what was supposed to reside there. All the other figures I've
sensed, heard, or seen were in places no one ever considered to be haunted.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My experiences started very early, about age 3 or 4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The front yard at my Dad's house was very
large, and although there was only 2 or 3 large trees, there were about 3 large
bushes and 7 or 8 small ones, but nothing you could really hide behind.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I always remember playing in the yard and
seeing dark figures watching me from behind the bushes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were always shaped like people, usually
a tall man, and like a dark shadow. Often, I would hear someone talking to me
when no one was around, actually calling my name on several occasions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I didn't find out till 8 or 9 that my Dad's
house actually had been haunted at one time, but all the activity seemed to
have stopped when certain furniture was moved from the house, which had all
belonged to someone who had died, but I'm not sure if they had died in the
house.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My parent's divorced when I was young, so I lived with my
mother, and this is where I reside now, except when I am at school.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We live very close to a major state hi-way,
as in, it's right outside our front door. Luckily we have a good sized back
yard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not as large as my Dad's yard, but
good enough to have many adventures in.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We live in a small house with a garage off to the side about 10 feet
from the south side of the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
remember once when I was 7 or 8, I was walking inside from playing in the yard,
going between the house and the garage go around the corner of the house and get
to the front door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was about 6 or 7
pm in the middle of the summer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I
was about 5 feet or so from the corner of the house, a big black figure ran
past the front of the house and garage.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After it passed, I ran up to see where it had gone, but saw nothing
unusual.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I can only describe it as
something like the Hound of the Baskervilles: A large black dog, about the size
of a Great Dane, red eyes, and long sharp teeth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I immediately ran inside, terrified, and told
my mom about what I saw.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Nothing eventful really happened again until my junior year
in high school.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was driving home from
my boyfriend's at the time, at about 10 pm. My radio was blaring in my little
S-10 pickup, and with my hi-beams on, I had just reached the intersection of SR
124 and SR 13, which was less than a quarter mile from my house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was usually a county police officer
stationed at a little gravel drive beside this intersection, so I stopped to
look even thought I was the only car for miles.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I looked both ways, and<span style="">&nbsp; </span>when I
turned back to the road in front of me, a black dog was moseying diagonally
across the intersection in the path of my hi-beams.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It looked solid, but somehow I knew it wasn't
a living dog.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It sniffed at the road as
it walked, and only glanced at me once, and just before it left the light of my
headlights, faded into nothingness.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I saw the dog 5 more times after that, 3 more times near
that same intersection at night, once on the way to nearby <st1:country-region w:st="on">Peru</st1:country-region>, <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Indiana</st1:place></st1:State>
in the afternoon, and once chasing a car at the city park at night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He never seemed to be doing the same
thing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Along with the dog, I started
seeing the shadowy people from my childhood again, but in the oddest places.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Often I was driving when I saw them, and they
were crossing the street or just walking by, although one seemed to crouch
behind a parked car and jump out in front of me, but thankfully I knew it
wasn't a pedestrian or anything.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I also
saw a small girl crouched in the girl's bathroom at my high school during
passing period between classes one day, a black shadow like all the rest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">This is also about the time I saw the girl who supposedly
haunted a wooded trail behind a local elementary school.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The story goes that the girl had been led
back into the woods one night, raped, and killed, and now haunted the place,
usually playing mind games with any male that stepped foot deep in the woods at
night, but usually leaving the females alone.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My boyfriend, a mutual friend and I had decided to walk the trail one
evening.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They told me how they had come
out here one night with a few others to play paintball, and had all at one
point heard a girl calling there names, except it had sounded as if it was
inside there head.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The three of us
walked to about the middle of the asphalt trail, just before it curved, facing
a small hill.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I suddenly got an odd
feeling and told my boyfriend I wanted to go back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I wasn't necessarily scared, just nervous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sure enough, I looked over at the hill, and a
girl's face was poking over the crest, smiling but looking curious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I flipped out for some reason, and buried my
face in my boyfriend's shoulder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither
he nor our friend saw or felt anything unusual.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I haven't seen the black dog again since I started school at
<st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Ball</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">State</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Both me and my roommate, however, have seen a girl in the bathroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To me she has long hair, and to my roommate,
shorter, curly hair. There was also an incident involving the supposedly
haunted Elliot Hall, where a door kept opening and closing of its own accord
during the annual Elliot Haunted House during Halloween.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I'm now getting ready for my sophomore year in college, with
the same roommate I had before, and were actually moving into Elliot Hall,
living just a floor below the 4th floor haunted library, where a student
reportedly hung himself from the rafters post-WWII. I haven't a clue whether or
not my roommate and I will still see things, but I actually hope it all
continues, and hope that maybe the black dog wanders back.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">An Old House</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I have been interested in the paranormal since I was a
little girl, not until I moved into an old house had I ever experience
anything.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was about 3 years ago in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">North Platte</st1:City>, <st1:State w:st="on">NE</st1:State></st1:place>,
my fiance and I moved into this apartment, well actually it was originally a 4
bedroom house but someone had converted it into 2 apartments, we moved into the
front half and the back half was empty.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Our half still had all the original woodwork and everything, but the
back half was all new with a new staircase and remodeled floors and everything.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well our agreement with the landlord was we
would refinish (sanding, and staining) all the floors, stairs, banister and
kitchen for rent, the whole house had wood floors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anyways the first incident we had, we were in
the living room and we started to hear footsteps like someone was upstairs, so
we went upstairs in our apt. and looked around and didn't find anyone,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>then we heard it again a few moments later
only this time it sounded as if it was coming from the other apt, we had access
to the back apt and went in and looked around still finding nothing out of the
ordinary, even checked down in the basement and nothing, so we just brushed it
off thinking that it was the house just creaking as it was old.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The last incident was while we were sanding
the staircase and banister, my fiance was on the middle landing and I was just
a couple of steps below him, we had two electric hand sanders on and all of a
sudden I heard a man's voice yell, "GET OUT!" It sounded as if
someone was standing right next to me and yelled it right in my ear!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was so loud that I even jumped a
little.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As soon as I heard it I stopped
sanding and so did my fiance, I asked him if he said anything and he said no,
then he asked me if I said anything and I told him no, we both looked at eachother
in awe, we got up, left everything where it was and ran out of the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Needless to say we didn't go back for a
couple of days and only to get our stuff out when we did return.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had always had a weird feeling when I was
in the house alone, like I was being watched, and the living room was always
cold, it was the middle of summer and the house did not have any A/C
installed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I never got any history on
the house or what if anything ever happened there, but it's still standing and
it's been totally remodeled except for the outside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well that's my one and only story, Happy
Reading!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Apartment Ghost</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: <st1:PersonName w:st="on">mskz@sympatico.ca</st1:PersonName></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><st1:City w:st="on">Brampton</st1:City>, <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Ontario</st1:place></st1:State>, there are 3 known ghosts who have
been seen.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The first is the "man in the black cape".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He first appeared to me when we first moved
into our apartment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At first I thought
it was just shadows, but one night, several months later, my husband and I were
watching a hockey game on TV when he said that he had just seen a man in a
black cape go up the hall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had never
mentioned this to him - ever, as I thought I was just seeing shadows and
getting used to our new place.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The second is the "little girl".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rumour has it that there was a little girl
who was murdered in this building somewhere.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I was awoken one night from my sleep, with a feeling that someone was
staring at me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I looked into the
hall, I saw a young girl, approximately 10 years old.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At first I thought it was my daughter, who
was about the same age, however, when I called to her, thinking it was my
daughter, and I stared, I realized that this was not my daughter, but the ghost
of a little girl, with long, curly blonde hair and dressed in a nightgown.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The third spirit I have recently seen is that of an old
woman.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After doing my laundry in the
basement laundry room, I came out of the room and turned right to go to the
elevators.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I suddenly stopped and
gasped, as I saw the white, ghostly spirit of an old woman standing at the end
of the hallway, just outside of the management door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Just as suddenly as I saw her, she was gone.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Over the 10 years of living here, we have heard dolls sing
(they were battery operated and you had to hold their hands to do this).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There were 3 dolls who could sing different
nursery rhymes and they all sang at exactly the same time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The little girl seems to be attached to me
and one morning while I was making the lunches for the family, she tapped me on
the shoulder, like someone playing tag, and ran into our storage closet in the
kitchen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The touch was cold and icy and
gave me quite a chill.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One day, while
home alone on the computer, a cupboard door in the dining room suddenly started
to open by itself, very, very slowly and it was creaking.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Something that since, both my husband and
myself have tried to duplicate and cannot do.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The door was shut and someone had to have pulled it open to have this
occur.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have seen lids lift, toys
move, things disappear and will suddenly re-appear in the exact same place it
should be within hours of it being missing.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I sometimes have the feeling of being watched, or of someone being in
the room with me<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(I am a homemaker) and
when I turn around, I will sometimes see either the ghost of the man in the
black cape or the little girl, still in her nightgown.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I often sense the little girl is wanting a
"mother" to take care of her and perhaps she sees my own kids and
wants me to take care of her as well.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Perhaps she has seen my daughter at sometime and perhaps that is what
has brought her here.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have heard
knocking at the door and when I look, nobody is there...no kids in the stairs,
nobody at all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There have been
knock/scratching noises at the door as well, but these noises come from the
inside, not the outside hallway.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again,
like the little girl may be playing games.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">There are rumours of a man being stabbed in the building
years ago.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(along with the little girl
who is reported to have been murdered but I don't know by whom or how she
died).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There have been many old ladies
who have died of natural causes as well in the building.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The murders took place before we ever<span style="">&nbsp; </span>moved in here, so I have no proof of
that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, the strange and unnatural
things we experience in our apartment is sometimes very creepy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There are many nights that people above and
below us and even beside...from the first floor up to the 15th floor, will all
hear the same noises at the exact same time.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Sometimes it sounds like someone hammering or building, other times it
is more like marbles rolling around on the floor above or beside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Tenants are complaining constantly about
their neighbors above, below and beside, blaming each other for making these
noises, usually they are all heard just before and around 11:00 p.m.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">If there are ghosts in this building, they are all very
friendly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Never anything evil and never
anything destructive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is something
that we have come to live with, if there was any sense of danger, we would have
moved out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We all seem to live happily
in here, however the old lady has only been seen in the basement, she has not
come here to us - yet!!!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">By: cage771@insightbb.com </p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Last night I had several odd experiences and wanted to share
them with you due to to the fact that it happens to be listed in your Haunted
Places Index.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">For the past few days, I<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>have been finishing a large job for <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Illinois</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">State</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>
in four of their resident halls (Hamilton-Whitten / Atkin-Colby). </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">In all four buildings, I had to go from the 11th floor
(elevator equipment/mechanical rooms) to the basement. The ISU building mechanic
and I had no problems until we got to Atkin. We started on the 11th, and from
the moment we walked through the doorway, we felt like we were being watched.
It was easy to pass off....there were two of us. But we both became rather
anxious and upset rather quickly. And then we started hearing noises. Sounds of
half full paint cans being tipped over, doors opening, and low whispers. We
tried to explain it off as sounds from outside, I could tell by the guys face
that he really didn't buy it. I sure didn't! After about 20 minutes of this, we
were done and made our way out. Walking out of that door felt as if a huge
weight was lifted from my shoulders.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Until we got to the basement, everything went fine. 20 or 25
minutes per floor, joking around, no pressure, trying to make the best of being
in a building with the A/C turned off and temps sitting around 100 plus
humidity. And then we hit the basement. Every time I turned around, I felt as
if the other guy was going to be walking out of a room either in front of me or
behind me. But it would always be that he was no where close to me..or those
rooms. This had never happened to me in the other three buildings, but in this
one, the same anxious and angry feeling came over me. I tried to pass it off on
being tired, or hungry, or dehydrated, but none were the case.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Well, it finally got the point where we had one room left
down there. I purposely passed it over when I walked by it. Just walking by
this room made me sick to my stomach and gave me a nasty chill. It was a balmy
91 degrees down in that basement, but I still had goose bumps. The building
mechanic came over and mentioned that he had passed it by also and did not seem
to enthused to open it for me. We were about to just fake the paperwork when a
call came over the radio asking about it. So he opened the door and a terrible
oder came rushing out. In the darkness, we saw a human figure shaped something
move. It wasn't a shadow. This dark something "ate" the light that
was poring in. I could see shadows and other dark objects, but the density of
this obscured our vision. We reached in and flipped the light on.
Incinerator/Trash room. OK...that might explain the smell even though the only
things that should be coming down the trash chute would be paper and other
non-food stuffs. We could even explain the slight breeze off as coming through
the trash chute even though the door to it was secured shut. But even we
couldn't explain the cold. The same cold I've experienced in documented haunted
places. For the entire minute and a half that we spent in that room, we both
felt cold and sick to our stomachs. As we were leaving the room, without
touching the light switched, the light bulbs (all 8 of them) died. And I was
shutting the door behind me, thankful to be out of there, the last 4 inches of
the door travel was forced shut. There is no door closer on that door.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Upon reaching the lobby, although I felt much better, I
still couldn't shake that feeling. Even my co-worker noticed it thinking I was
sick or dehydrated.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">There is something full of malice in that building. Maybe an
old employee. I don't know. I sure wish I had my cameras with me though!!</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Well...thanks for reading my tale. It gives a bit more
credence to your index. Although I don't want to ever go back there, I have to
in a few weeks. I will be bringing some gear with me. Hopefully and can catch
something good....</p>
