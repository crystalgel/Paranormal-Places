<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Frequently supernatural phenomena occur
in certain locations.&nbsp; These locations include houses where tragic
deaths have been reported, factories that have exploded or burnt with employees
trapped inside, lonely stretches of roads where individuals have been hit
or their cars have</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">crashed and bridges to name only a
few.&nbsp; Bridges have become infamous for being haunted probably because
they provide isolated locations and structures in which tragedies occur.&nbsp;
There are beliefs bridges have become haunted because they cover running
water which acts as a magnet for supernatural occurrences.</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">All around the world there are bridges
noted for their haunting.&nbsp; Sachs Bridge, Gettysburg, PA is where 50,000
men died July 1863 during the Civil War.&nbsp; Benton Jones in 1883 built
the Roseman covered bridge in Iowa where two sheriff's posses trapped a
county jail escapee in 1892.&nbsp; The escapee uttered a wild cry, leapt
straight up and disappeared.&nbsp; It was agreed that the man had to have
been innocent.&nbsp; Nectar Bridge in Alabama is the 7th longest bridge
in the world before it caught fire and burned.&nbsp; However, it was reported
that the a mail carrier that died within it's walls haunted</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">the bridge until it was destroyed.
In Alabama there are thirteen ghostly bridges that have been placed back
to back over small creeks and lakes in which weird things have happened.</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In Indiana and Ohio, there are dozens
of bridges that are reportedly haunted.&nbsp; The number of construction
workers falling into the wet concrete forming the abutment is amazing.&nbsp;
The expense of removing the poor luckless employee doomed him to remain
buried within the structure thus</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">creating another reason for the haunting.&nbsp;
One such bridge is called White Lick Creek Bridge in Indiana.&nbsp; An
employee named Dad Jones, 6'5" known for his strength was always given
the most dangerous jobs.&nbsp; One day, waiting for the concrete to fill
the abutment the platform Jones was</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">standing on fell.&nbsp; He sank into
the wet concrete.&nbsp; Although the men wanted to save him, they were
told the expense would be too great and he would be dead by the time they
reached</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">him.&nbsp; So, Dad Jones remains entombed
in the bridge and is seen walking when the full moon is out.</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Then there are incidents in which babies
have been thrown free of the bridge because of car wrecks or conditions
in which the mother lost her child over the side only to return to seek
her child after death. These are bridges referred to as "cry-baby" bridges.
One "cry-baby" bridge can be found in</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Dublin, Indiana.&nbsp; Dublin is a
small town off US 40.&nbsp; { NOTE: The road leading to the bridge is no
longer there and the path is on private property.&nbsp; The owner, fearing
for the safety of visitors refuses to allow access to the bridge.}&nbsp;
It is reported that a woman driving into town during a horrendous rain
storm, skidded across the bridge and lost control slamming into the railings.&nbsp;
As a result throwing</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">her infant from the seat of the car,
through the window and into the creek below.&nbsp; The baby was swept away
and never found.</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Each state and country has at least
one haunted bridge.&nbsp; Some like Indiana have dozens.&nbsp; Whether
they are urban legends or truths, one has to wonder why is there such a
connection between bridges and the afterlife?</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Is it because of the tragedies that
have occurred or is there more to it?&nbsp;&nbsp; Bridges serve as connections
and paths in which to travel.&nbsp; In folklore and mythology bridges are
often associated with heavenly paths in which the dead travel the bridge
to reach the afterlife.&nbsp; These paths are</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">frequently referred to as "bridges
of souls."&nbsp;&nbsp; Myth and folklore are referring specifically to
rainbows and the Milk Way but is it possible that those who died on these
bridges are still searching for their path to the afterlife?</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b>
