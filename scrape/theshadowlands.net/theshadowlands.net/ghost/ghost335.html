Other Experiences<br>
<br>
By: gizmozmts@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
&nbsp;I have wrote to you before about my other experiances, but I have
one about a haunted house a friend of mine lived in a few years
back.&nbsp; A bunch of us used to hang out there he had a lot of bon
fires over the summer.&nbsp; The first time I had ever went there was a
few months after he moved in.&nbsp; I was dating his best friend, and
he told me that he thought it was haunted.&nbsp; I in turn did not
believe him, at first, then things happened.<br>
&nbsp;We were in the kitchen and all of a sudden we heard something
from the basement, like someone using a broomstick and hitting the
ceiling from the basement.&nbsp; I laughed at first and asked who was
down there.&nbsp; Then I saw the look on my friends face, he was
terrified, and suggested we go outdoors for a while.&nbsp; While we
were outside I asked what was going on?&nbsp; He said that was the
ghosts way of letting him know he was annoyed.&nbsp; So he leaves the
premisis for a while.&nbsp; I still was skeptical until I looked up and
could see into the front door and standing there in his living room was
this old guy who was somewhat glowing!!&nbsp; I Almost hightailed it
out of there when they decided it was safe to go in!&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;I told them I was leaving and they insisted I go back in so I
did.&nbsp; I asked my friend if he has ever seen his "ghost" he said
no.&nbsp; I described to him what he looked like and he looked into the
previous owners of the house.&nbsp; Well it turns out there was a guy
who died in that house who looked like the same man I described!!&nbsp;
I freaked after that as well as my friend.&nbsp; Things were going good
at first like everytime my friend came home from work he would announce
himself and the guy never bothered anyone.&nbsp; There was always this
room upstairs that everytime you walked by it, you could feel a cold
draft from the door and it was locked.&nbsp; We never thought anything
of it, till the man started to get mad.<br>
&nbsp;There were more parties going on out there cause of summer, well
the man seemed to not like the parties, and he started showing himself
more to me and my friend.&nbsp; I knew he was getting mad, and things
got bad when he started attacking my friend at night.&nbsp; He would
wake up to slashes across his back!!&nbsp; We checked into the history
more and found out that the man was not friendly when he was alive and
worse when he was dead!!!&nbsp; It did not take long for my friend to
move.&nbsp; The beatings were worse by the time he left.&nbsp; Although
he never attacked me I always felt threatened by him I would wake up to
him right in my face, and he would disappear when I would scream. <br>
&nbsp;I still think about the horrors that man would do to everyone,
and how my friend survived actually being attacked by a ghost!&nbsp;
Sometimes I still have dreams about this man and how he chases people
out of "his house".&nbsp; To this day the house is still empty.<br>

Neighborhood Haunted House<br>
<br>
By: goosethemighty@hotmail.com<br>
<br>
My name is Billy and I would like to share a supernatural story of mine
with you. Although my story does not have a "physical" contact (seen a
ghost) there was definetely something supernatural in the house.<br>
It was a few years ago back in 2001 or 2002 I believe in Mississauga
Ontario. Mississauga is a fast growing suburbs just outside of Toronto.
The place in question was your very typical haunted house on top of a
hill surrounded bye vast land which in turn was surrounded bye
industrial and commercial land.The house was deserted&nbsp; only of
it's occupants as it's remaisn lay trapped behind borded windows. I
know it sounds silly but that is exactly what it was, that looming
house on the hill that every kid stared at as there parents drove bye.
I was one of those kids, who while in the back of my parents car stared
silently at the house as we drove bye. But it was more than just the
stereotypical view of the house the captured me, there was something
there, something odd that pulled me in. it was not until a few years
later that I had the guts to go to the house.<br>
I had moved away from Mississauga to Toronto but I never forgot the
house. I had always told myself that I would go back, alone, and take
photographs of the house. So one day I grabbed my camera and I headed
back to the house. It was early spring and the leaves have yet to grown
on the trees.This house had the most scary driveway I have seen,
probably the length of 2-3 footballfields and that is no joke. Now from
what I know the house remained deserted and the land untouched bye
commercialists. I guess sometime, someone managed to get inside because
the roof was burnt completely off. Most of the window boardings were
torn down and the insides of the rooms were completely overturned and
damaged. From the beer cans all over the place there must have been a
party. The property around the house was littered with about 3-4 sheds
and about 4-5 old rusted cars and scraps all over the ground. I forgot
to mention that for some reason I decided to go the house in the
evening, dusk to be precise. I had less than an hour to take
photographs before darness settled in.<br>
So I entered the housefrom the back because it was the only part of the
house with an open door. The floor was littered with papers, over
turned chairs and alot of other rubble. I took some photos on the
entrance and made my way inside. I went into the room that was the
furthest into this part of the house (the first floor had two sections
of the house that could not reached from inside). This room had an
overturned couch a fireplace and a littered floor.This room gave me
very strong thoughts about entering it. I don't know what it was but
there was something that felt like i WASN'T SUPPOSED TO BE THERE. But I
entered and I stood at the the far right corner behind the couch and
aimed my camera towars the fireplace. The light on my camera flickered
on and off rapidly and my camera refused to take the photo. I tried and
tried but my camera would not take it, instead I stood there and
whatched as the room went from total darkness to light as the camera
flickered on and off. Afraid of what might appear I left the room and
stood looking into it from beyond. From there I went to the upstairs to
where a previous fire left the entire floor naked to the sky. This is
where I noticed something odd. <br>
The house's main floor (as I had said before) was divided into two
parts, neither could be reached from inside the main floor. You either
had to leave the house go around and enter through another door. Or as
I just had learned, you had to go upstaris cross over to the other side
and take another set of stairs down. Unoftunetely the stairs that lead
to the other side of the house was blocked bye fallen timber. But this
layout of a house was very, very odd, it did not make sense.<br>
So I went back downstairs and went around the the otherside of the
house to enter. I found an open window and pulled myself up onto the
ledge. I froze right on this spot, starring deep into this part of the
house. I have no idea what it was but something was telling me to stay
the hell away from here. I felt this deep, fear, this huge warning of
not too enter this part of the house. So I pulled myself back down and
walked away.<br>
Now here is the interesting this; I have dreamt much of this house
before I had gone to visit it. In my dreams there was another entrance
to the house, or another part of the house. A tunnel, carved into the
house from the ground. As I walked away from the house that day I saw
it. about 50 feet from the house, 5 feet down the portal of it cemented
there lay another path wide enough to crawl through that pointed to the
house.<br>
Now you can believe this or not, everything I have said is true, just thought you would like to hear it.<br>

Winter Storm<br>
<br>
By: Anonymous<br>
<br>
In the late 1970's I attended college in NY State around the Finger <br>
Lakes. The building I describe was built in the 1890's. Since we were in <br>
the middle of the first oil crisis, students who remained on campus <br>
spent the short winter term in the old Main dorm to conserve energy.&nbsp; <br>
As it happened, some friends and I were assigned a large, empty room on <br>
the top floor.&nbsp; It was four floors up and one floor below the attic and <br>
one end slanted along the roofline. The room had been primarily used for <br>
storage. The gloomy winter sun had a hard time shining through the one <br>
iced-up window facing the lake.&nbsp; Dark as it was, we cheerfully shoved <br>
the desks to one side and slept on the floor to give us more room.&nbsp; We <br>
were having a good time "camping out" and weren't inclined to do much <br>
school work until our papers were due.<br>
After 3 weeks or so, a winter storm was approaching so we decided to <br>
stock up on the necessities and have a little party just amongst <br>
ourselves.&nbsp; I'd like to say that we all were sober as judges and went to <br>
bed early after saying our prayers.&nbsp; However, it being the late <br>
Seventies we indulged in smoke and alcohol.&nbsp; We had the stereo up loud <br>
but the music couldn't completely cover the growing sound of the wind. <br>
Our window was frosted up and a tree branch scratched at the glass. <br>
Every now and then someone wondered whether we would be snowed in.&nbsp; <br>
Someone said we would at least be able to get down on the tree.&nbsp; <br>
Eventually, we turned in.<br>
Unsurprisingly, that night I had a very spooky dream.&nbsp; A woman hovered <br>
over me and was trying to say something to me.&nbsp;&nbsp; God knows I tried to <br>
understand but her fluid outlines and vivid colors made me feel a bit <br>
queasy.&nbsp; I woke up, certain she was still in the room.&nbsp; I saw nothing, <br>
just the shadow of the tree limb swaying outside.&nbsp; "Too much party", I <br>
thought and went back to sleep.<br>
We were quiet the next morning.&nbsp; I supposed it was due to too much of a <br>
good thing the night before.&nbsp; The snowdrifts were impressive as the wind <br>
had been so wicked, but the sun was out and the sky was clear and the <br>
snow was pristine.&nbsp; It was so different than the storm that I felt up to <br>
sharing my spooky dream.&nbsp; It seems that 2 of the others had strange <br>
dreams as well.&nbsp; Since we all dreamed different things, I was certain <br>
nothing occult had happened.&nbsp; I was very relieved since we still had 3 <br>
weeks to live in that room.&nbsp; <br>
Being a Florida girl, I was still curious about snow still and wanted to <br>
have a look around.&nbsp; I dragged a willing soul with me and we make a <br>
quick trek around the yard.&nbsp; Finally, I wanted to see about our tree.&nbsp; <br>
My companion was bitching about the cold as she ran into my back.&nbsp; When <br>
she saw why I had stopped she said, "sonofabitch".&nbsp; You may have guessed <br>
by now that there was no branch, no tree, no vegetation within 15 yards <br>
of our window and nothing was 4 stories high.&nbsp; We dug in the snow a bit <br>
to see whether it had fallen. Nope. No trunk, no hidden limbs in the snow.&nbsp; <br>
We ran up to the room to look out and make certain we had the right <br>
window.&nbsp; When we heated off the frost with a hair dryer and we looked <br>
down and saw nothing but our tracks.&nbsp; Every one of us marched back down <br>
to try and find our tree.&nbsp; Nothing.&nbsp; We went back upstairs and talked a <br>
bit to get over the shock. We were all skittish but managed to sleep in <br>
the room, but with our mattresses shoved much closer together. After <br>
that we never mentioned much, why bother, there was no rational <br>
explanation. I am just glad I wasn't the only witness. That would have <br>
been crazy-making.<br>

My Guardian Angel<br>
<br>
By: Ben77194736755@aol.com<br>
<br>
Hi, I live in the United Kingdom &amp; have had a few ghostly
experiences. My first was when I was about 7-8 just after my dog had
passed away. He used to sit with me at the top of the stairs when I was
younger as if to protect me from falling down, he would let me be till
Id made it all the way up or down. After he was gone, I used to sit on
the same top stair pining for my best friend. One evening I watched as
a cat walked from the dinning room door, which was open through the
living room door which was shut. This wasnt the only time I met the
cat. I always slept with the door shut to my bedroom but felt a cat pad
&amp; paw its way to getting comfortable on my bed. I also remember it
purring aswell. We did have a cat at the time so I thought it was her.
I reached down to stroke what I thought was my cat, instead there was a
small indent in my mattress, when I turned the light on, there was
nothing there, my door was still shut &amp; my cat wasnt in the room.
During my teens a few times I woke to find my light on &amp; television
turned on. This stopped when I moved out of the family home while I
went to college.<br>
I suppose more disturbly is what has been happening to me for the last
few years. In 3 different properties I have lived in, my bed has been
shaken, first couple of times it happened I was really scared, but have
gotten used to it now &amp; have accepted it. If I had the courage I
would ask it what it wants, but it has never hurt me &amp; I believe it
is there just to let me know its looking out for me. Whenever it has
happened, it is usually when I have been upset, it happened after I
broke up with my ex girlfriend for example.<br>
Thank you for listening, from what I've seen of your website so far has been brilliant.<br>

My Ghostly Happening<br>
<br>
By: ATravelers@aol.com<br>
<br>
One day my family and I decide to have cook out for the 4th of July. Me
and my cousins go to the park and eveything seems fine. When we get
back from the park everyone is in my uncles swimming pool having a good
time enjoying the nice day.My cousins and I decide to go in side to get
some ice cream when it all started. When we get inside numerous <br>
doors start to slam and then it got really cold. We ran outside in a
panic and told my grandma what happened she says it was nothing. About
ten minutes later it everything goes really still like there is no wind
or anything then the huge table umbrella begins to lift out of it's
socket in the middle of the table! After that the party was over we all
left!<br>
About 4 months after that my uncle decides to go to Myrtle Beach and
needed someone to watch over his house so we volunteered to do it and
in return we got to use his pool! We didn't get to use it until the
before he got back but now we wish he came back earlier! We brought my
friend to go swimming us. We were swimming for about a hour when we
began to here a dog bark really loudly thinging nothing of it at the
time we kept swimming. My mom at the time was inside my uncles house
doing bills. It started raining next and my mom came out and told us
that it was almost time to stop swimming. As we got out of the pool we
heard a faint moning sound coming from my uncles garage so we ran
inside. Next my mom says i seen on the walls i think someone is in the
house!! Then as we start running away we hee a loud shreek then a man
screaming help me help me!!! We were so scared that i forgot my
sandels! Anyway after that my uncle told me he has heard little kids
screaming from his basement. But after these happenings are part of my
uncles "protecting ghost bexause everything that happens happened when
he was not in the house!&nbsp; <br>

Wonder to this Day<br>
<br>
By: HIMtopia19@aol.com<br>
<br>
<br>
I lived in a small, cramped apartment in a building that was built in
the 1940's in Kokomo, IN.&nbsp; I had heard several ghost stories from
my friends and whatnot, but had never taken any of them to heart until
I saw firsthand a ghost in my very own home.<br>
I had never truly felt at ease in my apartment, it had always seemed as
though something else resided besides my boyfriend and I.&nbsp; What
got me thinking was the fact that whenever i opened the front door, I
saw a faint shadow of a person walk into the kitchen, which was to the
left.&nbsp; Lighting can create that, but no matter if the light source
were emitting from the right, left, behind me, or even not at all, I
ALWAYS saw a faint shadow of a person walk into the kitchen.&nbsp; I
really never thought much more than it being a light trick, though I
was creeped out that I saw a shadow even though there would be no light
at all.&nbsp; After a while I rarely noticed it.<br>
Things changed on January 19, 2004.&nbsp; I was on my computer in my
living room.&nbsp; To the left of me was a walk-in closet; we always
kept the doors to the closet open.&nbsp; I was the only one home.&nbsp;
It was nighttime and the lights were on in the house.&nbsp; I stared at
the screen, not paying attention to anything else, when the lighting in
the room changed and got dimmer.&nbsp; It repeated this for a few
seconds and I chalked it up to the snowstorm outside.&nbsp; A few
minutes go by and then, to my left, I see what appeared to be a person
outside my field of vision.&nbsp; I wear glasses, so I don't see way
off to the side too well.&nbsp; Anyway, I turned my head and I saw--as
clear as anyone could ever see--a young man walk straight into my
closet and disappear.&nbsp; I remember exactly what he had looked
like--about 6 feet tall; short, straight blond hair; wearing only a
pair of baggy blue jeans.&nbsp; He never looked over at me, I only saw
him from the side as he disappeared into my closet.<br>
Strange I know, and I could not make sense of it either.&nbsp; I was so
scared that I immediately jumped up from my chair and drove to my
mother's house, where I stayed for a couple of days.&nbsp; Later on,
after I moved out a month later, I found out from my landlord that the
last resident was a young man who had committed suicide by hanging
himself with a noose in the walk-in closet.<br>
I wonder to this day, Why did I see him? What was the purpose? I don't
know if I will ever know, but I have been both fascinated and
frightened by my experience from the day it has happened.<br>

My 3 Ghost Experiences<br>
<br>
By: johnnydeppluver9@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
i'm thirteen years old and i know alot of you think i am just making
this up but i want to share my three experiences with ghosts and they
have happened in the house i am living in now in MD. I want to start
with the one that is probably at the least four months old . As most of
you know as a kid i go to school monday through friday then have the
weekend and on friday nights i stay up extremely late. So one night i
was on the computer in my living room,(if your on my computer you can
see my couch out of the corner of your left eye)at abut 2:30 a.m. and i
have comcast cable so i have music videos on a certain channel and i
had it on a low volume because&nbsp; my parets were sleeping and all of
a sudden the tv went from music videos to the show the x-files(i told
my grandmother that about a week before her death ) and out of the
corner of my eye i saw a woman figure sitting in the middle of my couch
and let me tell you i screamed so loud that i woke both my parents up
and i could here them getting out od bed . But really scared me was
that before the figure disappeared it looked straight at me then went
away.And when i told my mom she laughed at me saying i was tired and
needed sleep, btu i know for a fact that i saw what i saw and i hope
all of you believe me because it scares me everytime i retell this
story. And also i think it is my grandmother because i was always close
to her and she told me that no matter what happens to us we will always
be together.<br>
This is my second experience-i was in bed one night ,(with my room its
narrow and the foot of my bed is close to the door) and i woke up and
if you lean over my bed to the left you can see down the hall so me
being the curious one i heard a noise so i leaned over and saw this old
man with a cane looking at my doorway and i was so scared i was
paralyzed with fear I closed my eyes trying to make it disapper but
when i opened my eyes again it was right in my doorway staring at me
with dark eyes&nbsp; i cound'nt scream or anything. then i heard the
steps moving and then man looked down the hall then back at me and
scurried into my brothers room which is right next to,mine my brother
had spent the night at his friends house that night) and my mom came up
the stairs going to her room . Let's just say that i ran to my mom
faster than i had ever ran before and i am 13 and it was the first time
since i was 6 that i slept in my mom's room clinging on to her for dear
life.that was about a month ago and then nothing happened i didn't see
the ma anymore untill two days ago and i knew i had to post this on the
website<br>
My third and final experience was again while i was sleeping. And this
one is the most intense.I had been sleeping and then i felt my bed
shift and when i looked up thinking it was my mom it was the same man!
I just stared at him and him at me. i whispered to my mom but i knwew
she couldn't hear me because she was down stairs so the man just kept
starin at me and then it looked at my neck where i have a small scar
from when my brother and i got into a fight and i fell scratching
myself and the mans hand came to my neck and i felt this cold chill go
down my spine and then he let go of my nack got off my bed and kind of
drifted out of my room and then disappeared. I had to take long
breathes to keep from fainting. ummm.. i want to thank all of you who
read this and if there are any mispelled words i am so sorry but now i
have to go and get to sleep and go to school tomorrow so i want to say
goodbye and i will update if anything else happens<br>

Marion(Grant County)Hostess House<br>
<br>
By: AKRMVERMILION@wmconnect.com<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Several years ago I was in the hostess house to photograph a young
couples wedding.&nbsp; The night of there rehersal&nbsp; was the
anniversary of the elderly womans death.&nbsp; Several things
happened.&nbsp; People in the kitchen had said that earlier in the day
the stove quit,light bulbs blew and then that evening she was seen
watching the rehersal.&nbsp; At the time of the meal the staff was
bringing out the salads on a cart and then for no reason one from the
bottom tray flys off as if the carpet had a bump in it.&nbsp; Upon
checking it out it was found that the carpet was smooth.&nbsp; A staff
member nervously joked that maybe it was the woman who used to be the
caretaker.&nbsp; I at one point went to reload my camera and seen a
shadow of a woman going upstairs.&nbsp; Curious I followed.&nbsp; She
went into the room that used to be hers.&nbsp; I will never forget that
experience.<br>

<br>
Lone Mountain College<br>
<br>
By: Unic563@cs.com<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The college that I attended in San Francisco had been built on what was
on 2 different occasions cemeteries. The small campus&nbsp; which is
centrally located sits atop a large hill and is now part of the USF. I
attended the last four years of Lone Mountain's College before the USF
sale, from 1974-1978. I was a resident&nbsp; assistant during my stay
there. I experienced and recieved reports from other students and staff
of many strange happenings. Footsteps in the hallway that could not be
expained , because if you happened to be in the room outside of where
the footsteps could be heard or any where near and you opened your
door, no source of the steps could be found. An old pipe organ in the
locked chaple would sometimes play a chord between 3 and 330 am. When
security would arrive to investigate the locked chaple would be empty.
Several people including myself had seen orbs that seemed to race
across a walkway connecting the dorms and the main building. I
personally used to see the back of nun who would walk briskly along the
dorm hallways only to disappear into the heavy fire door at the end of
the hall. This figure that I saw seemed to be like a blurry picture
that on the last occasion that it went past me I could feel the sudden
cold spot that I had heard about from other people about the fire door
on the second floor. It is said that a novice nun who was to teach the
first class of music students the year that college opened as a
finishing school for young Catholic Women, jumped to her death into
what is now the parking lot. It is said that she had an affair with a
priest from USF, and took her life when she found out that she was
pregnant.<br>

Seeing<br>
<br>
By:ruddyb29@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
<br>
The Following happened in Pocatello, Idaho and Basalt, Idaho:&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
In 1981, I witnessed my sister, Linda Dianne Smith, being kidnapped
from our home while babysitting me. Because of my single mother's
financial and social status at the time, the police treated her
kidnapping as a runaway or a joke. They thought I had made up the
kidnapping to cover for my sister. Many weeks passed and still no
contact from my sister. Finally my mother took me to a hypnotist and I
was able to recall almost everything that had happened that night. Then
and only then did the police treat her disappearance as suspicious.<br>
Later that summer, after my mother finished school, we all decided to
move in with my maternal grandparents. We had only been there a short
while, when one night lying in bed I heard someone calling my name from
outside. I got up and went outside across the street and there standing
alone was my sister. I thought to myself this isn't real. But she came
over to me and hugged me and told me not to worry about her anymore
because she was ok, but would not be able to see me again. I loved my
sister dearly and only being 9 years at the time I wasn't sure if I was
dreaming or not. However, when I woke up the next morning thinking I
had dreamt that whole scenario, I got out of bed and noticed my feet
were all muddy and dirty. I never went outside without my shoes on
before, mainly because the spring before my sister was taken she had
stepped on a bee, and I didn't want the same thing to happen to me.<br>
In May of 1982, a few months after "seeing" my sister some kids were
playing on a hill nearby where we used to live and discovered some
human remains. Mainly a skull and a few other fragments. They were
later identified as my sister, Linda Dianne Smith. Her kidnapping and
murder remain a mystery to this day. Although I am still uncertain of
what I saw that night I would like to think it was my sister coming to
say goodbye.<br>

Like What They See<br>
<br>
By: La3Dr@aol.com<br>
<br>
i grew up in franklin, in. a college city 30 miles south of
indianapolis. shortly after my mother died in 1980, my sister,
step-brother n his wife came up for a weekend to visit with my father
and me to go through some of mom's items. after they left the following
sunday, i had laid down for a nap. during the course of the nap, i was
jarred awake by a&nbsp; presence. i saw the curtains to a window
looking out onto the street close by themselves and saw the shadow of a
woman sitting on my bed. i knew immediately it was mother but was not
the least bit frightened by it. she was merely checking on me to make
sure i was ok. several years later, the house was up for sale. as the
final sales details were being worked out, i had stopped in to visit
for a little bit. while laying on the floor reading the local paper, i
smelled the aroma of perfume all of a sudden then heavy footsteps down
the hall. i know it wasn't my heart palpitating as i would have felt
that right off. mom's favorite perfume was chanel #5 and dad was known
for his heavy steps, even on level ground. again, i was not frightened
as i knew they were just checking in. another time took place when i
got home from work. i was living in an apartment on the westside of
indianapolis then and had gotten in from work during a fierce electric
storm. i happened to look over at an end table where dad's picture was
and noticed it had an extra glow about it. again, he was just checking
in. they haven't visited me anymore lately. i guess they must like what
they see<br>

Ghost Stories<br>
<br>
By: BigRed4Life17@aol.com<br>
<br>
I have always lived in Lawton Oklahoma, and I was raised in a house in
lawton in mission village, nothing ever happened to me untell I was 5
years old. I remember sharing a room with my 3 sister, because we lived
in a small house, we had bunk beds and my 2 little sister sleep on top
and me and my older sister sleep on the bottom. My older sister liked
to sleep by herself so I would always sleep on the floor, I remember in
the middle of the night, it would always be after 12 at night there
would be a lot of things that I saw or heard, but nothing ever happened
to me. The first thing I has ever happened to me was when I was
sleeping on the ground and I was still awake and my 3 sisters were
sleeping and I was just looking at the window and there was this figure
of a guy that flew up to my window, cause at that time we didn't have
anything over them at all. Well this figure of a man flew up to the
window and I could see through him, and he had a knife in his hand and
a piece of paper that said "I am going to kill you." Then a figure of a
women flew up to the window with a knife in her hand right next to the
figure of the man with the same exact note, saying "I am going to kill
you". They were there for about 2 mins and I woke up my older sister
but by the time she looked at the window they had already disappeared
and I have never seen those same 2 people ever agian. To this day I
keep something over my windows.<br>
When we moved in the house, I remember hearing a story of a little girl
who was murdered in the alley next to hour house. They said the little
girl was a Girl Scout and was was selling cookies, and she stopped in
the alley to play in the dirt to take some time off from selling her
cookies, well they say that when she was digging in the dirt a guy came
up and killed her and barried her there. I was also told that there is
a ghost wolf that was barried underneath the water meter in the same
alley. Well on night I was in the kitchen getting something, I cant
remember what i was getting, and I had a feeling telling me to look out
the window, and from the window you can see the alley. Well I looked
out the window and there, that little girl and that wolf was playing by
the water meter and then they just disappeared. Agian I have never seen
them since I lived there.<br>
There was one night I was sleeping on the floor and agian I was awake
and everyone else was sleeping, the door was open and from my bedroom
door you can see the leaving room. Well out of no where people started
to appear, figures of people in the old days with the nice dresses and
gentlemen in suits. It was of a party that they used to hold or you
could say get togethers, there were ladies and gentlemen talking with
wine glasses and they had the old ball room music playin and it had
looked like my living room had changed into a really nice I really dont
know how to put it, but like a really nice room and in really big house
at the time. I was about 6 or 7 at the time so I was scared and I was
crying to I tryed to wake up my older sister, but at that time I have
had so much stuff happen to me, she believed me and she didn't want to
bother with it because she knew I wasn't lying. Well after I tried to
wake her up everything just went back to the way it was. To this day, I
always sleep with my door closed and facing the wall.<br>
We had moved out of the house by the time I was 11 and from when I was
5 to 11 there had been a lot more stuff happen to me. Well we moved out
of that house and moved into a house out in the country about 3 miles
out of Geronimo, Oklahoma. A lot of the you could say Paranormal stuff
slowed down and really nothing else happened to me. One night it was on
a friday I think, and I had stayed up late watching tv. When we moved
in the house we found out there was a little girl and a little boy that
was in the house at the time, but never had seen them so really didn't
think anything of it. Finally about 2:30 a.m, I decided to go to bed,
my older sister was staying the night with someone so I decided to stay
in her room, since I lived there that room has always gave me bad
feelings, you could say feelings of not being alone. Well I layed down
closed my door and turned on the radio, because I have heard so much
stuff when I was younger that the radio tuned them out. Well I was
facing the wall and all of a sudden I heard a little girl and a little
boys voice sincing "Ring Around The Rossies" at that point of time I
have seen so much that nothing could scare me at that point of time,
really some little kids. So I turn around and there was a little girl
and a little boy playing and singing "Ring Around The Rossies in the
middle of the room, and all of a sudden they just stopped and stared at
me for a while and started walking towards me and then they just
disappeared. I am guessing they are the one that are always opening
doors when I shut them, and turning off lights when I have them on. But
like I said it really didnt bother me, because I have gone through so
many Paranormal Activities that it didn't bother me anymore.<br>
My older sister had moved out of the house with her husband and moved
back to lawton. Well one night I was staying the night with her and I
was sleeping in the living room and I can see the bathroom from there.
Well I was laying there awake agian and I seen a black figure of a man
standing by the bathroom door and just disappeared. Come to find out my
sister told me, that her husband had seen the same black figure
standing by the bathroom door. Later on we found of that someone was
killed in that house and was thrown in the closet right by the
bathroom. I had seen that black figure in the house about 4 times the
whole time they lived there.<br>

Conetoe Rail Crossing in NC<br>
<br>
By: bruce.watson@ngc.com <br>
<br>
I can confirm the lights and even more at the Conetoe rail crossing in
North Carolina. Although it's been several years since I've been to it
(and after the last visit won't go back), I can remember it well. To
describe the area, it's straight railroad tracks that cross over a
country road and enter a long stretch through a wooded area. The woods
on the left go for miles and on the right go about 200 yards and meet
up with the back yards of 2-3 houses. Light from the houses is barely
visible. The tracks going into the woods do not intersect with another
road for about 3 miles according to a map of the area. (Thus the light
is NOT cars crossing the tracks further up). No activity has been
reported in the track's opposite direction.<br>
About the lights: When the light appears, it's barely a flicker about
100 yards away. If you stand still, the light will intensify and get
closer. If you move toward it, it will move away but never leave the
area of the train tracks. The light will only come to about 20 yards
from you. One time the light was so bright the entire area looked as if
it were daytime. Sometimes the light swings back and forth (like a
lantern) and other times it seems to be a foot off the ground or as
high as six feet off the ground. One guy in our group threw some rocks
and yelled at it. With this the color changed from a dull white flicker
to an intense yellow. I don't know if that color means anything.<br>
There's more than just a light on the tracks. On one occasion, it
became so dark when the light went away that we could no longer see
each other. (On that trip there were eight of us). I also noticed that
the stars above were no longer visible. This continued for about five
minutes. Toward the end of that time, we (ALL OF US SAW THIS) noticed
what looked like shadows walking toward us. I'll try my best to
describe this. It's already pitch black and we can't see each other,
normally you can see the trees that run along the tracks (about 15 feet
of clearance on both sides). Even "blacker" were the shadows, more like
silhouettes, walking toward us. They looked to be thin, long men about
10-12 feet tall with very long arms and legs. We could actually hear
the gravel along the rails under their feet. When they were about 10
yards away they stopped and stood, as if suddenly aware of us. We could
clearly make out features like ears and fingers. As the light began to
come back and we could see again they faded out of sight. Having pissed
ourselves, we left too. Other times before that you can hear voices.
What they say can't be made out but all present could hear it. Needless
to say I won't be going back. . .<br>

Candlelight Hallway Ghost<br>
<br>
By: millennium2069@hotmail.com <br>
<br>
I was about 5 or 6 years old, and I was lying in my bed, trying to go
to sleep.&nbsp; At this age, I was still sleeping with the light dimly
lit, because I was somewhat afraid of the complete darkness.&nbsp; My
sister was a few years older than me, and for some reason, she would
always get up in the middle of the night and use the restroom, or get a
drink of water, probably because she felt like she could.&nbsp;
However, on this particular night, she was spending the night at a
friend's house.&nbsp; I had forgotten about this at the time I was
lying in my bed that night.&nbsp; I was staring out into the hallway
outside my room, because I couldn't go to sleep. Suddenly, I saw a
girl, about the age of my sister, walk by my room.&nbsp; I thought it
was my sister, and didn't think much of it, until I didn't recognize
the outfit she was wearing.&nbsp; It was an old quilted-fabric child's
bathrobe that I had never seen before, and the girl was carrying a
candlestick on an old-fashioned hand-held candle&nbsp; holder.&nbsp;
She had an eerie glow about her, and it was that of a negative of a
photograph, although her figure was not completely black.&nbsp; I said,
"Hello?" softly, hoping that my sister would tell me to go back to
sleep, or even to be quiet.&nbsp; However, she did not.&nbsp; The girl,
whose hair was slightly lighter than the shade of my sister's, turned
her head slowly and looked at me.&nbsp; She smiled, then frowned again
quickly, and turned her head straight ahead even quicker.&nbsp;
"Hello?&nbsp; Andrea?"&nbsp; I said, again (Andrea is my sister).&nbsp;
No answer.&nbsp; Then the girl proceeded down the hallway toward my
parents' bedroom.&nbsp; I got up out of my bed and peered into the dark
hallway, and looked to the left, the direction in which the girl was
walking.&nbsp; There was nobody there.&nbsp; I looked in my sister's
bedroom, which was directly to the left of mine, and turned on her
light.&nbsp; She was not there, and it was then that I remembered that
she was sleeping over at a friend's house that night.&nbsp; I realized
that I was rather scared at this point, and went back to my room, this
time shutting my bedroom door.&nbsp; I never did see that figure again,
and I don't think that I want to.&nbsp; I have no idea who or what it
was, but I can say that I didn't like the feeling that it gave me after
frowning and turning the way she did down the hall.&nbsp; To this day,
I sleep with my door closed, making sure the glow from the clock on my
CD player is bright enough to keep away the complete darkness.<br>

THE NIGHT HE CAME BACK<br>
<br>
By: _evil-13@msn.com<br>
<br>
This did NOT happen to me personally but I know it&#8217;s true because it happened to my mother a few years ago.<br>
She (my mother) works in a cafeteria where there are a lot of usual
clients that visit and eat there every day. My mother makes a lot of
friends and knows a lot of the costumers that go there since she's
worked there for about 20 years. There was a costumer that she knew,
that went there every day at the same time of day for many years. Then
one day he stopped going for many days. One night, my mother woke up in
the middle of the night and saw a shadow, the shadow got closer and my
mother realized that it was the customer(lets cal him john)that she had
not seen in days. John talked to her and said that she shouldn&#8217;t worry
about him that he had gone to a better place and then he disappeared
into the darkness of the room. The next day when my mother went back to
work a co-worker told her that John had died a few days before from
natural causes. My mother thinks that the reason he visited her was
that john usually joked with her about haunting her in her sleep once
he died<br>

My House<br>
<br>
By: reaperm120@aol.com <br>
<br>
I own a house that is just over 20 years old. The original owners were
an older couple followed by a couple of renters. Nothing notable has
happened in its short history.<br>
Not long after we moved in, I was in a walk in closet in our master
bedroom and stepped into "something". I didn't get any feelings of
hostility, just that something was there and I ran into it. I started
to have a panic attack and felt smothered (I am a USMC and army vet and
am not claustrophobic or prone to panic). When I stepped back, I was
fine and vacated the closet area. We also hear music at different
points in the day (I've looked around in the attic for wire and such in
the event that something natural was acting as a radio). <br>
My wife has had a number of run ins with something that will take items
of hers (usually toiletry type things). She will be unable to find them
for a day or two and then they will "reappear" in the same area where
she had left them.<br>
On another day, my wife had gotten home from work early. When I
arrived, she told me that there was a loud crashing sound in the attic
in an area where we didn't have anything stored. I grabbed a flashlight
and pistol and looked but could find nothing out of the ordinary.<br>
When my wife was present with our first child she slept in the new
baby's room the last month or two due to needing more room for comfort.
She used to get up in the early morning hours to urinate. One night
around 0200 or so, I woke up and seeing a shadow moving down the hall
assumed that it was her and went back to sleep. In the morning I
mentioned it and was informed that she didn't get up that night.<br>
On another evening, our son was down for the night and my wife and I
were sitting in the den. Out of the corner of my eye, I caught a
glimpse of a small figure (size of 3 or 4 year old child) race out of
the hallway and head towards the kitchen. I assumed that my son had
decided to raid the frig and got up to send him back to bed. There was
no one there. I then went to my son's room and he was sound asleep.<br>
At another time, my wife and I were sitting in the den one evening when
the lower part of the curtain on our sliding glass door started moving
like something was behind it. My wife asked me if I saw what she did. I
watched it to see if it would do anything else then moved towards it
and moved the curtain. Again nothing.<br>
My wife and I have both had experiences with bursts of cold air in the
house, particularly towards the back area. She has also had "something"
brush against her while in the shower. Also in the master bathroom, a
plastic cup used to bathe the children will fly through the air. Most
recently, I heard it bouncing around a few nights ago. We have a kitten
but it never has shown an interest in batting cups. The cat will also
sit to the side of the door going in the bathroom like she's waiting
for something.<br>
These are just a sample of what we've run into at our house. Whatever
it/they are, they aren't hostile so I haven't made any attempts to
bring a priest in. My mother has visited and heard the music and
occassionally conversation type voices as well.<br>

Hope you enjoyed this! <br>

Grandpa's Cigars<br>
<br>
By: Leppard50@cs.com<br>
<br>
I have a ghost experience to share with you.<br>
My Grandpa loved to smoke cigars.&nbsp; He smoked them everyday - he
was pretty much a chain smoker.&nbsp; He would even fall asleep in his
chair with a lit cigar hanging from his mouth.&nbsp; I don't know how
he never got burned.<br>
My Grandpa died in 1989 when I was 10 years old.&nbsp; I recently began
visiting my Mom's grave (who died when I was born) and decided to start
visiting Grandpa since he was up a ways from my Mom's grave.&nbsp; One
day a couple of years ago, I stopped by to say "Hi!" to Grandpa and
found two used cigar butts placed neatly above his grave - next to the
grave stone.&nbsp; I took a closer look to see if I was really seeing
what I thought I was seeing.&nbsp; I even picked one up to see if it
was real. When I got home, I asked my Dad, my Uncles, and my Brother if
they had gone to visit Grandpa recently.&nbsp; I thought they may have
gone to visit and smoked a couple of cigars to reminisce.&nbsp; None of
them had been to his grave in a few years.&nbsp; My Grandpa's friends
have also been dead for quite some time, so it couldn't have been any
of them.&nbsp; I determined that Grandpa had come down for a smoke
break.&nbsp; The odd thing is, my Dad and one of my Uncles placed two
cigars in his shirt pocket at the family viewing after he died.&nbsp;
Perhaps he decied now was a good time to use them.&nbsp; Every now and
then, I can smell cigar smoke coming from out of no where.&nbsp; It
must be his way of letting me know he's still here.<br>
Thanks for the forum to share experiences.<br>

<br>
By: duane.sweazy@sbcglobal.net<br>
<br>
i was helping a friend of mine put up a christmas tree in his house that i let him borrow for the hollidays<br>
i looked up to see a large woman in a bright yellow dress watching the procedings<br>
i have known my firend for a while and knew that no woman lived in that household at the time<br>
i had never seen my friends grandmother before but i knew it was her<br>
she had died many years before i moved to plainview<br>
she told me that i should tell her husband not to go up north to work but to stay in plainview and be with his family<br>
this i told him and he started crying<br>
i could not shake the feeling that the issue of the yellow dress was very important<br>
about a week later i was talking to my friend and asked him if his grandmothers favorite color was yellow<br>
he told me that yall it was and that before she died she had her whole house painted yellow<br>

Ghost Haunting<br>
<br>
By: Brett J.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i live in Rockford.&nbsp; On Cannonsburg road, their is a subdivision called Bear<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Creak.&nbsp; In my house I have had many hauntings which is weird because we<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; built the house.&nbsp; The only thing for me to explain is that a have a large<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hill and at the bottom (this is all woods)&nbsp; there is remains of a road and i<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; have found bricks and a door handle and tape.&nbsp; I think their used to be a<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hut down there.&nbsp; I think who ever lived there is who is haunting my house.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One experience is I was throwing a tennis ball at my roof and I accidentely<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; threw it over the house.&nbsp; I looked on the other side and there was no ball.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I looked at the roof and there was no ball.&nbsp; The ball showed up in the grass<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a week later.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another incident was when i was in the house alone I heard a knocking at<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my front door.&nbsp; I walked to the front door, no one there.&nbsp; This didnt scare<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; me.&nbsp; I than heard a knock at the back door, no one there either.&nbsp; Still<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; didnt scare me.&nbsp; I than walked to the front door and looked out the window.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I than heard the knocking at the front door.&nbsp; I was scared.&nbsp; My brother<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; later told me something similair had happened to him.&nbsp; His was the only<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; haunting i heard in the house other than mine.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another incident was when my brother was gone so i chose to sleep in his<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; room which is right next to mine.&nbsp; I heard something in my room.&nbsp; I freaked<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; out but stayed in the room.&nbsp; I heard something down the hallway.&nbsp; I walked<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; down stairs with my pillow.&nbsp; When i went back up to turn off the light i<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; heard something in the closet in my room.&nbsp; I than knew it was picking on me.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Probly the
most freaky was once when i was on the middle floor of my<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; house, I was alone.&nbsp; I sat there when i heard something up stairs.&nbsp; I slowly<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; got up and looked upstairs.&nbsp; I saw nothing.&nbsp; I walked to call my parents.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the call i saw a person out of the corner of my eye three times.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have head many experiences of some one touching me.&nbsp; Just now i heard<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; something behind me and than after i looked back and looked forward again I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; felt something touch.&nbsp; Later when i looked back i saw something white in the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; woods.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had an experience in
Gettysburg.&nbsp; I was in the Jenny Wade house.&nbsp; When<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i was in there i felt a presence.&nbsp; At the end of the tour i was on we went<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; into the celler where the body was laid.&nbsp; My dad took three pictures with<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; our digital camera from the same angle.&nbsp; One had the outline of a dress.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is all i have thanks for your time.<br>

Dad's House<br>
<br>
By: oakmeadows@cableone.net<br>
<br>
My mother died suddenly and we sold our home to move in and take care
of dad.&nbsp; We had him four years before he past.&nbsp; After his
passing I did notice a few small changes but most of all - the master
bedroom was at the of the hallway and looking toward the end at the
livingroom you could see the reflection of light from the front
door.&nbsp; If my husband came in late and walked down the hall I
couldn't see the light.&nbsp; Many nights I would hear him walking down
the hall blocking the light but only to find he was asleep next to me
in bed.&nbsp; Later we sold the house to a lady that worked for dad in
the past and I briefly mentioned different happenings.&nbsp; She said
she knew dad was still there, but it didn't scare her because she knew
him.<br>

&nbsp;Best Friend<br>
<br>
By: laracroftm789@hotmail.com<br>
<br>
Dear Ghost People. I would like to share wat this is my story.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; It was September 17, 2005 in my bedroom in Palm Coast Florida. My stepmom <br>
(Jessica) and I where waiting for my father to come home. When he did we had <br>
an enjoyable chicken meal. *Note i'm only 16 years old. My father's house, <br>
which Jessiace was staying @, was very bright. We ate for awhile and we all <br>
3 stayed up late. I remeber the room was filled with happy things and a good <br>
atmosphere. It was pretty late about 10:30 pm. Looking around, I felt tired <br>
seeing my stepmom and dad in bright colored clothing. Went off to bed and <br>
said goodnight. Once, I had a best friend when I was 13 years old she had <br>
died of an illness ( think it was heart tumor or damage.) Don't remeber. I <br>
was sleeping all of a sudden it got freezing cold in my room.I figured it <br>
was the a/c but I was wrong.&nbsp; Looking over at the clock it said 12:00am. I <br>
was like umm ok watever. It was pretty dark in my room. Ignoring the <br>
coldness, I felt as I was being watched by someone. Sitting up in bed,I <br>
looked around my dark room I saw a black human like shadow of a man and a <br>
tall woman. Thinking i was seeing stuff I squinted. The shadows walked back <br>
(single file one after the other)&nbsp; (3 ft apart from each-other)and fourth <br>
across my room! It scared me! I was shocked. The pacing back and fourth <br>
slowly came to an end when they vanished but not before the woman shadow <br>
glanced at me and left out my bedroom door. Still sitting up I was so <br>
shocked I couldn't move. Just as I was about to scream for Jessica..A medium <br>
sized&nbsp; shadow of a little girl showed up. It looked like Kelly?! (best <br>
friend) She did the same thing as the other two adult like shadows and <br>
walked back and fourth. She then took a dead stop and looked at me and said <br>
upsettingly "Help me I feel very sick!" But before Kelly had passed away, <br>
she wanted me to help her. I told to her "I'm sorry Kelly please forgive me, <br>
I love you." Then it/she left through the bedroom door also. I haven't seen <br>
the little girl or tall shadow people for a while. But I do often hear that <br>
cry "help me i feel very sick!" almost everyday.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>

The Haunted Civil War Hospital<br>
<br>
By: Daddysgerl93@aol.com<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;My stepdad knows a man who used to live very close to where he (
my stepdad) works. His house was an old Civil War hospital. He and my
stepdad are friends, so he shared his story with my stepdad. I am about
to list all of the strange happenings as I am typing on my cousin's
computer, and while I also use her email address. <br>
&nbsp;This man originally bought the house for around $200,000.00. Soon
after that, he experienced some frights.&nbsp; One night his wife and
him were sitting on the sofa listening to music. It blasted as loud as
it could go. His wife walked to the radio and turned it down. That
happened two more times. It scared her, so she unplugged it. It blasted
all the way up again. <br>
&nbsp;They also had a Christmas party. There were seven witnesses who
saw a floating ham sandwich, believe me! During the Civil War, patients
were served beans and cornbread. That is what the couple smelled as
they walked into their basement. They were so scared, after buying the
house for two hundred thousand dollars, they sold it for one hundred
thousand dolllars.<br>
&nbsp; People started to visit the house after that, so we decided that
we(my family) should too. We saw a candle floating in front of the
window, with nobody in the house. When we returned the next night, it
was not a candle, but a lamp. I hope you believe this true story, why
would I lie?<br>
&nbsp;If there is any feedback of anybody having similar experiences,
please email my cousin so she can tell me. We would like to know.<br>

The Boy<br>
<br>
By: vragnauth@snet.net<br>
<br>
When I was about 12-13 years old I was home alone washing the dishes. I
had a feeling that someone was watching me so I turned to look. I saw
for a split second, what looked like a very pale little boy maybe 8
years old with dark rings under his eyes and thick dark hair. I turned
my head and turned back again and it was gone. I was afraid but
continued what I was doing thinking my mind was playing tricks on me.
About half hour to an hour later I was sitting on the radiator looking
out the window, waiting for my my ride to a friends house. I went to
turn my head from out the window when I seen the same exact boyish
figure only this time right in my face! It disappeared the same
instance that I seen it. I then got up and waited outside on the porch.
I would never have believed my own eyes if it didn't happen a second
time. I always felt uneasy in the house when I was alone. Of course no
one believes me but I know what I saw and I will never forget it. The
boy gave me the feeling that he was very sick. The house was built in
1892. In Naugatuck, Connecticut.<br>

Selby Ranch<br>
<br>
By: jesicab@sbcglobal.net<br>
<br>
&nbsp;My family (on my mom&#8217;s side) has been visited by entities both
malicious and benign for as long as I can remember.&nbsp; Now, I will
say that I am an archaeologist &#8211; never worked on burials though &#8211; but I
believe myself to be a person of logic.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not sure about the
stregnth of the power of suggestion, but I am sure about my
experience.&nbsp; Which, leads me to believe that the stories that my
mother has told me are true too.&nbsp; <br>
Lets start with my experience.&nbsp; In the early 1990&#8217;s I lived in
Sacramento, CA in a townhouse inside of an apartment community named
Selby Ranch righ along the American River.&nbsp; It used to be a horse
ranch that was built over in the 1970&#8217;s (don&#8217;t know how long it was
there before).&nbsp; Anyway, there was one room in the three bedroom
townhouse that always gave me a heavy feeling in my stomach, and made
the hairs on my neck stand up.&nbsp; Unfortunately, this ended up being
my room for some reason.&nbsp; At first things were OK, I just
convinced myself that I had watched too many horror movies or
something, and that was why I felt kinda weird in that room.&nbsp; A
few months went by, and then at night at least a dozen or so times I
would feel someone sit on the foot of my bed on whatever side I
happened to be sleeping on that night.&nbsp; I would turn to look, and
no one was there.&nbsp; This went on for a few weeks.&nbsp; I was
starting to have my guard up every time I would go to bed.&nbsp; One
night I had been up particularly late &#8211; for some reason I just could
not sleep, which was unusual for me.&nbsp; I finally started to doze
off &#8211; you know when your half awake and half asleep &#8211; and I felt
someone put their lips to my left ear, as I was laying on my right
side, and with hot breath in my ear said my name &#8220;jessssssssssica&#8221; like
a hiss.&nbsp; I was so scard that I bolted up in bed, and threw the
light on and sat in bed reading for hours. I eventually fell asleep for
like 2 hours that night, but with the light on.<br>
My mom was an Army brat, having lived all over the East Coast and in
Germany and Austria.&nbsp; While she and her 1 sister and 3 brothers
were living in South Carolina in an old house the same thing happened
to my mom in the basement of the house while she was home alone.&nbsp;
She tells that the entity said her name three times. The first time she
heard it faintly off in the distance and discounted it as one of her
siblings.&nbsp; The second time it was a little louder and she went
upstairs just to make sure no one was plying tricks on her. The house
was completely empty.&nbsp; The third time it was just as I described
in my experience &#8211; lips on the ear, hot breath, and hissing a little
&#8220;yvooooonnnne&#8221;.&nbsp; She said she ran up the stairs, out the front
door, and sat on the porch until someone came home.&nbsp; <br>
My moms brother Jimmy had an experience while they were living on base
in Germany.&nbsp; He said he kept seeing lights outside his 4th floor
room at night.&nbsp; He had many times over the course of a few weeks
had the feeling of someone sitting on the bed while he was in it.&nbsp;
He would yell for one of the brothers to come and be with him.&nbsp;
One morning the family awoke to blood curdling screams from Jim&#8217;s
room.&nbsp; My uncle Jon went in to find him wrapped up so tightly in
his sheets that they could find no edges to unravel him.&nbsp; They had
to cut the sheet to get him out &#8211; like a cocoon of sorts.&nbsp; The
sheets were practically fused together.<br>
I have many other family stories, but I will save them for another
time.&nbsp; If anyone would like to talk w/me about these weird
occurances, please feel free to email me. Thanks for giving me a place
to post my experience.<br>

Possessed Girl<br>

<br>
i went to chicago this weekend for my grandmothers 90th birthday and decided <br>
to meet up with one of my friends that live there (i live in north <br>
carolina). im not a very strong believer in ghots but what happened that <br>
saturday night cannot be explained. after my grandmas birthday my friend <br>
picked me up and we went out, there was nothing to do so we decided to look <br>
for ghosts because he had done this before. about 12 people ended up going <br>
at about 2:30 a.m.<br>
down shoe factory road when i noticed something strange in the sky. <br>
everything was black in the night except for what looked like some white <br>
streaks across the sky. i pointed this out to my friend and he called the <br>
guy in the other car to piont it out to him and as he was talking we passed <br>
by an old barn that was supposedly haunted. the girl in the car then started <br>
shaking violently and her eyes rolling back into her head, then she <br>
proceeded to puke everywhere. we stopped for a minute to clean up the mess <br>
and let her puke outside but she seemed to be getting worse so we decided to <br>
find a parking lot to go to because it was really dark. when we reached the <br>
parking lot was when i got my first good look at her and it scared the shit <br>
out of me. it looked as if it was straight out of the exorcist, her <br>
breathing had become very heavy and her shaking even worse. everyone was <br>
freaking out and we all decided to take her to a church. as we were driving <br>
there i looked up into the sky to see that the white streaks had formed wat <br>
looked like a giant crow with its wing spread open wide. it must have been <br>
at least a mile wide, with nothing but the blackness surrounding it. we <br>
finally reached the church and as soon as we carried her body into the <br>
church, she snapped out of it and didnt say anything for about 10 minutes. <br>
she looked confused and we were asking her if she remembered anything but <br>
she said the only thing she remembered was getting some coffee at ihops <br>
before we left to look for ghosts. i stepped outside with a few people for <br>
some air and noticed that the giant symbol in the sky had completely <br>
vanished. we were probably at the church for about 30 minutes and as soon as <br>
we left the giant crow in the sky had returned out of nowhere so everyone <br>
was freaked out and we all went to this girls apartment to try to relax. no <br>
one slept that night and as day break approached one of the guys went <br>
outside to get something from his car and said that the sky was blue except <br>
for a black cloud directly above us. nothing else happened though and im <br>
glad but anyways im not sure wat went on that night but i hope i dont see <br>
anything like that again.<br>

Ohio Ghosts<br>
<br>
By: Twstdwtch04@aol.com<br>
&nbsp;<br>
When I was around 14 my perants where looking for a new house in the
country around Xenia, Ohio, and they olways drug me along for the ride.
On this particular day we where looking at a house in the country not
far from town, it was a nice day and I had wondered ahead of my parents
while they were busy talking to the realitor about the house. They were
in the living room and I wondered into the kitchen and noticed a door
off of this room which led up to the two bedrooms upstairs, it was
closed, so I openned it and there was the bottem half of a young man
walking up the stairs right before me, he was about halfway up the
stairs atmost to the landing between the two rooms. Needless to say I
closed the door and went to find my parents in a hurry. Latter when we
were back outside of the house looking at the yard my mother asked the
realitor why the family where moving from the home? My heart almost
stopped when he explained that the owners son was killed in a terrible
accident at the intersection in the road that was not far from the
house! I know what i saw was the ghost of this youngman going up to his
room on the second floor of that house. My parents didn't buy that
house thank god, but I will not forget what I saw that day. I have had
many experiences with ghost since then, and live with many ghosts in my
current home. They are mostley beloved pets that i have lost since i
moved into my current home and they don't distress me at all. Resently
a teacher of my Daughters has asked me to investigate a haunting in an
old church that she ran an antiqe store out of for some years, and if
there is anything there i'm sure we'll find it. I'll keep you posted.<br>

My Haunted Apartment<br>
<br>
By: jbird1632@yahoo.com<br>

My story started almost a year ago. My husband and I moved into our
apartment in Stillwater, OK in August last year (2004), and boy, do we
get action here! It didn't start right away, but actually waited a few
weeks. The first thing I noticed was when a cup went flying off the
counter in my kitchen while I was sitting in my living room watching a
little TV. Needless to say, I was just a little freaked when I saw
that. I ran into my bedroom and hid for about an hour, that is until I
realized that if it was a ghost, it could probably go through walls. I
left the apartment until my husband got off of work. When I told him
about it, he just shrugged it off at first saying that, "It was the
wind." There wasn't any wind going through that part of the apartment
that day. It then would turn off the TV when I was watching something
that I enjoyed. I had an old TV that if turned off by the button on it,
could not be turned back on by remote. I had to get up and turn it back
on by the button on the TV itself. I think it enjoyed that television
emmensly just for that little fact. It tried to do it to our new TV a
couple of times when we first got it, but quickly gave up once it
realized that I didn't have to get up to turn it back on. It also likes
to open and close the bathroom door and my closet doors in both my
bedroom and our guest room/study. The closet doors are a bit harder to
open, mainly because they slide and when one tries to open and close
them, they stick. My neighbor and I decided to see if we could capture
some EVP's, and to our surprise, we caught quite a few and only did it
like two or three times. It sounds like a little boy, a young woman,
and one sounds like a man. We also heard something that made us both a
little une y, we heard a growl, over the heater (it was in the winter).
I almost had a priest come and bless our apartment to try and get rid
of that last one. Whatever it is that's here, it doesn't seem to want
to hurt us, it just seems to want to play. It also likes to play with
my hair every once and a while. It also likes to open and close our
cabinet doors in our kitchen. My neighbors also have quite an active
little spirit in their apartment. These ghosts or spirits seem to get
really active when there is a lot of movement going on. For example, my
neighbors are getting ready to move to California in a few days, so
both of our apartments have been getting pretty active again. I can't
say that it scares me any more, I actually feel somewhat comforted that
they're here. If they really didn't like us, they probably would have
let us know long before now. I've never really seen an aparition ( I
hope I spelled that right), but every now and then, I think I catch
glimpses of something, but when I go to check it out, there's nothing
there. I rather like having such an active place, it gives me a lot to
talk about and it's kind of exciting. I hope that it doesn't, forgive
the saying, die down to much any time soon. I'll update my story if
anything else happens. Oh and by the way, I really don't know what, if
anything happened here to make these ghosts or spirits decide to stick
around..., yet. I'm still doing research on it. Until then, thanks for
reading my story.<br>

Is The House Haunted?<br>
<br>
By: Daddysgerl93@aol.com<br>
<br>
At my church when I was the age to be in the choir, my choir directer
was very religous, so of course, she beilieved in demon's. She used to
live in this old house, that was built in the early 1900's. As the
usual setting for a ghost story, it was a dark and stormy night. She
was a single mom at the time, and the lived in the woods. Her kids were
very young, so during the storm they got scared, and came to sleep in
her bed with her. When they fell asleep, she went to the bathroom.
While she was in the bathroom, she kept hearing strange noises. She
rushed herself so she could get back to the bed with her kids. When she
was going to her room, she walked past her broom closet. When she did,
the air got cold, and she felt a presence. When she was almost back to
her room, when something reached out and slapped her across the back.
To this day she still believes there's a demon out for her.<br>

Highway Man<br>

I'm really not a big believer in ghost stories, and usually believe that <br>
there's a reasonable explanation for just about any "paranormal" encounter, <br>
but there is one story that my brother in law tells that I think may be more <br>
than just a ghost story.&nbsp; He and some friends were driving home from <br>
visiting a nearby town's hockey tournament or carnival (I don't recall <br>
which) and they saw an old man walking in the middle of the road in front of <br>
them.&nbsp; My brother in law honked his horn to get the old man to move, but he <br>
paid no attention and just continued to walk on the road.&nbsp; They continued <br>
towards the old man and continued to honk the horn, but he just went about <br>
his business and ignored them.&nbsp; My brother in law says that as the <br>
approached almost close enough to strike him with the car the old man seemed <br>
to rise up and glide right over the roof of his car.&nbsp; Needless to say they <br>
were all pretty freaked out.&nbsp; they thought they might have struck him or <br>
something, they still weren't prepared to admit that it might have been <br>
something more than just a man walking, so they stopped and got out to <br>
search the roadside to see if they had indeed struck him, but they searched <br>
all around the area and found nothing to indicate that anybody else had been <br>
there.&nbsp; They still get creeped out by this story when they tell it to this <br>
day, because they all swear that they saw the old man, and I know these <br>
people they are the last people that would make up an half cocked ghost <br>
story.<br>
