<br><b>India lady speaks Finnish!</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Jesse@hotmail.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>India is a wild place with a long history of spiritualism. I have
a few experiences which stick out in my mind - all true stories. I was
taken to a remote village with a group of young people. We were all part
of a missionary team. After talking with the people through translators,
singing some song we had learn in Hindi, and telling them about Jesus,
many of the people came up to us and said they saw evil spirits and ask
if we could pray for them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A man brought up his
wife, he was crying and through a translator he told us that his wife was
possessed by an evil spirit and as a result she could no longer speak.
I was 18 years old at the time and was a little intimidated. I was with
a</b>
<br><b>man who was from Finland and we began to pray for the lady. After
praying for a few minutes nothing was happening, but I could feel a power
struggle. My friend spoke to this lady in his native Finnish language.
I saw her eyes change and this evil look came on her face. This primitive
lady who had never seen white people before, knew no English, began speaking
to my friend in Finnish. My friend told me that he&nbsp; commanded the
spirit in Jesus name to tell him where the gateway was. The spirit spoke
through this lady in a completely different language and harsh voice. He
said that the gateway was under a plate which the lady had put on her forehead
to honor a idol god. He could not believe that the lady spoke to him in
Finnish, (which is one of the most difficult languages to learn.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
We put our hands on the lady's forehead and her whole body started shaking.
We said in Jesus name come out and go to the place prepared for you. The
lady began coughing and coughing. She then turned to her husband and began
to speak with him in her native tongue, they both were crying with joy.
It was the first time they spoken together in over two years. Two other
people that night were prayed over in the name of Jesus by our friends
and had similar results. The people thanked God that they had been delivered.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Another time while living in India a Chinese friend and I learned that
our neighbor and hung himself. That night we were awoken by a series of
clear screams in our room. In one instant a scream was heard in all the
corners of our room and then I felt like a person was one inch from my
face and screamed. This happened about 1 am and my friend and I both were
woken from a deep sleep, we were so shaken up that we could not even talk
to one another for several minutes. The next day some friends down the
street also reported hearing a scream which ran down their street. This
happened every night for about a week. The scream would be clear and the
most evil thing I have heard. Finally we prayed to God for protection and
told the scream in Jesus name that it could not come back into out room.
It never came back to our room, but we heard it run down the street. After
praying down the street and near bye streets it never was heard again.
All this to say that spirits are real and can be controlled by the power
of Jesus name. If you ever experience ghosts or sprits command them to
leave in Jesus name and ask God to protect you.</b>

<br><b>Lake Placid, St. Moritz Hotel, July 2000</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: trinity20011@canoemail.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>We're just back from vacation, having spent 2 days at a very old
and</b>
<br><b>wonderful hotel called the St. Moritz in Lake Placid, New York.&nbsp;
We</b>
<br><b>stayed in a room on the third floor--a fairly pleasant room with</b>
<br><b>separate bath, but as you can well imagine, old plumbing/fixtures</b>
<br><b>throughout.&nbsp;&nbsp; A picture of the hotel in its hey day in
the late</b>
<br><b>1890's can be seen in the lobby to the hotel.</b>
<br><b>Day/night one was non-eventful.&nbsp; Our second (and last night)
there, I</b>
<br><b>arose to use the facilities about 2:00 am and entered the washroom</b>
<br><b>(with lights out).&nbsp; All was quiet until I heard what seemed
to be an</b>
<br><b>unearthly woman's moans above my head.&nbsp; It took me about 30
seconds</b>
<br><b>for me to realize these moans were not coming from the room upstairs,</b>
<br><b>nor a local radio or tv ....needless to say, I raced out of there
and</b>
<br><b>jumped in bed, my heart pounding.&nbsp; My boyfriend, still asleep,</b>
<br><b>greeted me with a grunt.&nbsp; I finally fell asleep totally curled
up</b>
<br><b>against him...until he got up about 3:30 am/4:00 am to use the</b>
<br><b>lavatory too.&nbsp; I stayed wearily awake waiting for him to return...and</b>
<br><b>saw that he looked a bit perturbed as he closed the door to the</b>
<br><b>lavatory a few moments later...(he never closes the door!).&nbsp;&nbsp;
While</b>
<br><b>he acknowledged my experience as valid when I recounted it to him</b>
<br><b>then, he said nothing more.&nbsp;&nbsp; We both went back to sleep.</b>
<br><b>Next morning, I mentioned the moans again to my boyfriend.&nbsp;
He then</b>
<br><b>said he needed to tell me something too.&nbsp; Don't ask me why
but I</b>
<br><b>stopped him midsentence and asked him to wait until we gathered
our</b>
<br><b>belongings to check out. While checking out, we asked the innkeeper</b>
<br><b>about the history of the hotel.&nbsp; She said she knew nothing
and was</b>
<br><b>always too busy to notice anything out of place. We left the</b>
<br><b>conversation at that.</b>
<br><b>In the car on the way out of town, my boyfriend recounted that while</b>
<br><b>sitting in the lavatory that night, (lights on), he noticed an</b>
<br><b>irregular (sphere-shaped but no definable edges, about 18 in</b>
<br><b>diameter) hovering, shifting mist about 18-24 inches in front of
his</b>
<br><b>face, just below eye level.&nbsp; At first he thought it was his
breathe</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;from the cold mountain air.&nbsp; Very logically, he checked
this by</b>
<br><b>exhaling numerous times away from the mist...and found he exhaled</b>
<br><b>nothing.&nbsp; He moved his hand through the mist.....it remained.&nbsp;
The</b>
<br><b>hair on his arms started to raise, goosebumps forming.&nbsp; Feeling</b>
<br><b>somewhat wary now, Steve left the lavatory quietly.....he must walk</b>
<br><b>through the mist to exit. He quietly closed the lavatory door and</b>
<br><b>turned off the light.</b>
<br><b>While we did enjoy our stay at this hotel, the room was clean, the</b>
<br><b>innkeepers were very friendly and hospitable, etc., we are curious
if</b>
<br><b>you had any other reports about unusual activity at this hotel or
in</b>
<br><b>the vicinity thereof.&nbsp; I should mention this hotel is next
to a</b>
<br><b>funeral home.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Historical Home Ghost</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:[cgrines@carolina.rr.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>hi i am writing to tell you of my experience. this happened in early
fall of 1993 in a town in Indiana(Lebanon), I was young 13yrs old at the
time. I remember going to this historical house which had been on to the
public for an open house. This house was over 100 years old. My parents
and I went into the house and were walking around. I decided to walk in
the living room which was to the right as you walk in. their were id say
aprox. 10 people in the house. As I was in the living room I happened to
look to the right of me and saw a boy who looked about my age at the time
sitting in a chair he stuck out to me&nbsp; than the other people their
that were in the house, he was wearing blue suspenders and an oldfashioned
hat like you men wearing from the 1920's. He was sitting by himself with
no expression on his face.I didnt think much of it until I went to find
my parents they were in the room right as you walkin to the place. I then
asked them to take a look at the living room which was very nice well preserved
room. As I walked into the living room the boy was gone. I began checking
the bottom floor&nbsp;&nbsp; their was no sign of him, I made my way to
the upstairs checked around and saw no one. I was thinking to myself theres
no way that the boy could have left. the back door was shut solid the only
way out was the front door. I told my parents about</b>
<br><b>the encounter soon after. Till this day I believe I encounter a
spirit of a young boy from the early 1900's. If you have&nbsp; any questions
about my ghost expierence please contact my email page JakeLV@aol.com&nbsp;
my name is Jake Veatch The site is frommy friend Chris's internet address
I just moved to Charlotte,NC from Indiana.</b>

<p><b>I was a16 year old girl when I first saw Jean she was 12 but she
was</b>
<br><b>tall as me and she was so beautiful. She had long curly blonde hair
and</b>
<br><b>so tan with blue eyes and such white teeth when she smiled.&nbsp;
She was</b>
<br><b>walking down the opposite side of the road from me and she as watching</b>
<br><b>me too and then she said do you live around here? I said yes we
just</b>
<br><b>moved in and she said I think you are the prettiest girl we have
in the</b>
<br><b>neighborhood now. I said no I think you are . We both laughed. We
were</b>
<br><b>both blonde and young and pretty.</b>
<br><b>We became best of friends even though she was 4 years younger than
me.</b>
<br><b>We planned to be friends for ever but when she was 24 and she had
two</b>
<br><b>darling sweet little blonde haired girls she was killed in an auto</b>
<br><b>accident on the e way. I was so devastated to lose my dearest friend.</b>
<br><b>It has been 30 years now since she died and now I do automatic hand</b>

and put</b>
<br><b>her body in the ambulance and she was taken to the morgue. Her vitals</b>
<br><b>were so low they could not detect she was still alive but of course
she</b>
<br><b>was not alive when they got done with her. She got embalmed and
prepared</b>
<br><b>for the funeral.&nbsp; She said how sad she was to have missed</b>
<br><b>out on raising her daughters that she loved so much. Her mother
Margaret</b>
<br><b>was so sweet but to old and sick to take them so they went with

<p><b>My Apartment</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: DMomofryan@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have always been fascinated by the supernatural and always believed
in ghosts.&nbsp; I've "spoken" with my dad several times since his death
4 years ago.&nbsp; About 18 months ago, my son (18 months old) and I moved
into the one bedroom apartment we still live in..&nbsp; After being there
for a month or so, I started having the same horrible dream every night.&nbsp;
I dreamed that I was holding my son and a "force" kept pulling him out
of my arms and taking him away from me screaming.&nbsp; At first, I thought
it was just the paranoid dream of a single mom, but then I started hearing
the words "CLOSE THE VORTEX" as my son was being ripped away.&nbsp; After
about 10 days, I finally got the hint and sprinkled holy water all through
my room while praying for this "vortex" to be closed.&nbsp; I have not
had that dream since.&nbsp; Then in March of this year (2000), I started
getting the feeling that we were not alone in the apartment.&nbsp; Lying
on my side in my bed, I can see to the end of the hallway, which has the
living room on one side and the dining room on the other.&nbsp; I kept
seeing a shadow walking from one room to the other.&nbsp; I woke up one
time to find a figure hanging on the ceiling fan above my bed looking down
at me.&nbsp; One night, I felt a soft touch on the</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;side of my face and I told it to get away from me.&nbsp; I
put holy water on the four corners of my bed, my son's bed and the door
to my room.&nbsp; The longer this went on, the more I started to feel afraid.&nbsp;
Not threatened, but I felt like whatever was in the apartment was trying
to tell me something and was getting frustrated that I was not doing anything
about it. I started leaving all the lights on when I went to bed and was
getting maybe 3 hours of sleep a night.&nbsp; Praying did not seem to be
helping.&nbsp;&nbsp; After finally telling my sister, I put holy water
in every doorway and every entrance to my apartment.&nbsp; While doing
this, I asked God to please take the soul back to heaven so I wouldn't
be afraid anymore. The very next night, I heard the words "thank you" and
I have not felt that spirit again.&nbsp; Then, about 3 weeks ago, I started
feeling that spooked feeling again.&nbsp; I went to bed one night and in
that phase right before deep sleep, I opened my eyes and saw two figures,
one at the&nbsp; foot of my son's bed&nbsp; and one beside my bed.&nbsp;
I blinked and saw that there were two Indians in my room.&nbsp; Sounds
weird, I know! The one at the foot of the bed just stood there with his
arms crossed and his back to my son.&nbsp; The other one started talking
to me.&nbsp; He said that they were there to protect me and my son and
to not be afraid.&nbsp; They would look out for both of us.&nbsp; I lay
down and went to sleep.&nbsp; I have woken up several times during the
nights since then and I always see the Indian at the foot of my son's bed,
always with his back to him and his arms crossed, like he is watching over
him.&nbsp; I can only see him from the waist up and he is not 3 dimensional,
more like colored smoke.&nbsp; I know this sounds really wild, especially
since I still live in the apartment, but I feel totally safe now and I
know that my son is being protected.&nbsp; One more interesting fact, I
live in Texas and recently found out that my apartment complex stands on
land that used to be part of the Chisolm Trail.</b>

<br><b>Several Family Member Experiences</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: ScriptCreator@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>My brother has esperienced a ghost once back in Mexico with our releatives.</b>
<br><b>He told me that he could not get a good nights sleep once in a room
where my</b>
<br><b>grandfather died.&nbsp; When my brother was asleep he noticed that
his bed sheets</b>
<br><b>were being pulled down from his feet.&nbsp; So he picked them back
up to cover</b>
<br><b>himself.</b>
<br><b>And again the bed sheets would go down.&nbsp; This persisted for
a few more times,</b>
<br><b>my brother kept lifting the sheets, he just dozed off.&nbsp; But
when he woke up in</b>
<br><b>the morning, he said that the bed sheets were nicely folded and
tucked under his</b>
<br><b>feet.</b>
<br><b>Another occurance he had was about 7 years ago.&nbsp; His friend
and himself were</b>
<br><b>heading home from a late night party.&nbsp; As they were heading
home, just a few</b>
<br><b>minutes left to reach the house, his friend, Joe, had forgotten
his house</b>
<br><b>keys.&nbsp; He was scared because he had lost them.&nbsp; My brother
then told me that Joe</b>
<br><b>received the keys in his hand.&nbsp; Something or someone had handed
Joe his keys, it was</b>
<br><b>not my brother.&nbsp; The last short story is what happened to my
great grandfather.</b>
<br><b>My great grandfather was riding his horse back home from working
at his ranch.</b>
<br><b>This was in Mexico.&nbsp; He saw a small boy crying and sitting
on the ground.&nbsp; He told</b>
<br><b>the little kid what was wrong and if he needed a ride.&nbsp; The
kid just pointed to a</b>
<br><b>direction.</b>
<br><b>My great grandfather just lifted the boy like nothing, like if the
kid did</b>
<br><b>not way anything.&nbsp; He was confused.&nbsp; But he rode off and
talked to the boy, which</b>
<br><b>said nothing.&nbsp; Well, as they rode along the dirt road, my great
grandfather turned</b>
<br><b>back to ask the kid a question, the kid was not there anymore.&nbsp;
So he kept on riding</b>
<br><b>down the road.&nbsp; After a few minutes, my great grandfather felt
someone tapping him</b>
<br><b>on his shoulder.&nbsp; He turns around to notice the small kid.&nbsp;
The kid replies to him</b>
<br><b>in Spanish, "Mira mis dientitos!"&nbsp; The translation goes like
this, "Look at my baby</b>
<br><b>teeth!"&nbsp; My great grandfather told his son and he told my father
the story.&nbsp; I was told</b>
<br><b>that the little kid smelled like sulfur and his teeth were pointy
or thinly large.&nbsp; My</b>
<br><b>great grandfather dropped the kid and took off like a jockey on
a horse.&nbsp; I hope</b>
<br><b>that you have enjoyed these small stories.&nbsp; I have not experienced
anything like this,</b>
<br><b>but I have had sleep paralysis in where I saw my aunt from Mexico,
who is not dead,</b>
<br><b>as a transparent figure walking in my house in the states.&nbsp;
Then I had to force</b>
<br><b>myself to wake up because I felt that I was being held down or kept
from waking up.</b>

<p><b>Has Anyone Seen This?</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: rikkiweinstein@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>This experience doesn't seem like much compared to the ones I have
read at</b>
<br><b>this site.&nbsp; That may be because I didn't experience it first
hand or maybe</b>
<br><b>because I am still a little skeptical.&nbsp; My stepdad is a real
night owl.&nbsp; One</b>
<br><b>night he was sitting up reading one of his sci-fi books when he
just</b>
<br><b>happened to look at the bedroom window.&nbsp; There he saw an old
man staring in</b>
<br><b>at him (they had a groud level floor) with curiosity, and no real
expression</b>
<br><b>on his face.&nbsp; He was powder white.&nbsp; My stepdad stared
in shock and blinked</b>
<br><b>and the man was gone.&nbsp; Exactly as he realized the man was gone,
the man was</b>
<br><b>at his bedroom door, Peering in at him. The man then turned and
walked</b>
<br><b>across the hall into my 3-year-old sister's room and my stepdad
could not</b>
<br><b>see from where he was.&nbsp; He was too petrified to move.&nbsp;
My sister then came</b>
<br><b>out of her room crying and asking if she could sleep with them because
she</b>
<br><b>was scared!&nbsp; She didn't mention a ghost though. The next morning
my sister</b>
<br><b>told me of a dream she had of an old man, glowing white with glowing
red</b>
<br><b>eyes walking throught the backyard carrying paint cans in each hand.&nbsp;
This</b>
<br><b>is an innocent 3-year-old probably not even knowing what a ghost
was telling</b>
<br><b>me of this "dream."&nbsp; Over the years I thought my stepdad was
kidding about</b>
<br><b>this occurance but he swears to it to this very day.&nbsp; My sister
doesn't</b>
<br><b>remember anything.&nbsp; It seems to make sense that it was an old
person.&nbsp; We</b>
<br><b>lived 2 houses down from an alzheimers nursing home!</b>
<br><b>I think it was just a ghost of someone who died at the nursing home
passing</b>
<br><b>through.&nbsp; The patients escaped all of the time to "go home"
and always</b>
<br><b>thought we were one of their past family members.&nbsp; Maybe this
'ghost' was</b>
<br><b>checking to see if he recognized us!</b>
<br><b>Will you post this on your site?&nbsp; I wanted to see if any one
has ever seem</b>
<br><b>anything like that before.&nbsp; It always seems like the ghosts
in teh stories</b>
<br><b>here are always mean and distructive.</b>

<br><b>My Ghost Story</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: SISU2005@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>I was divorced and moved to this area where my parents and I grew
up. I met a</b>
<br><b>man I really began caring alot of and we grew into a more serious</b>
<br><b>relationship.</b>
<br><b>We were living together for a time and during that time, my mother
died of</b>
<br><b>natural causes but, it was still a hard time without her. We all
loved her</b>
<br><b>very much and she had very strong religious beliefs and passed them
on to us.</b>
<br><b>She didnt think I should live with this man but, I did anyway.</b>
<br><b>After she died, my father decided to sell their home and move to
his family</b>
<br><b>home a few miles away. I wanted to buy the home but, he felt I shouldnt
while</b>
<br><b>living with this man. Well, my brother and sister talked him into
it as I had</b>
<br><b>children to raise and they would have so much more room. I told
my father, we</b>
<br><b>were planning to get married.</b>
<br><b>We moved into the house and each day or night, the lights would
flicker or go</b>
<br><b>out in different rooms. It was an eerie feeling and we had them
checked out.</b>
<br><b>There was nothing wrong with the electrical parts but, it continued
to</b>
<br><b>happened. Well, I felt maybe my mother was trying to tell me something
which</b>
<br><b>I kept to myself.</b>
<br><b>We got married at my parents house which we bought, the lights have
never</b>
<br><b>flickered or gone out since. I feel my mother was here and then
she rested in</b>
<br><b>peace once we were married.</b>
<br><b>My husband now and I have talked about it since and both feel that

<p><b>Lala</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Corax31@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Hello....I was reading through your vast volume of ghostly tales
and thought</b>
<br><b>your website would be the perfect place to finally tell my own.
Btw, I don't</b>
<br><b>mind if you use my name attached to the story, but I would prefer
you not use</b>
<br><b>my email address.....nothing personal, I just have this thing about
pasting</b>
<br><b>my email addy on the web. On with the story..... :)</b>
<br><b>I don't remember the first time I noticed the ghost in my home,
but my mother</b>
<br><b>swears she came with the house (we moved in when I was 2 1/2 years
old). But</b>
<br><b>throughout my childhood I always remember her being there with me.....like
an</b>
<br><b>"imaginary friend" who wasn't part of my imagination at all. My
mother called</b>
<br><b>her Amelia, after she heard the ghost say this name and gesture
to herself.</b>
<br><b>But I called her Lala because she was (and is) always singing. She
seemed</b>
<br><b>most attached to myself and my mother, despite the fact that the
other four</b>
<br><b>people in the house had seen or heard her at one point or another.
She has</b>
<br><b>even followed me off to college, and moving across country.</b>
<br><b>One of her favourite forms of getting our attention was dancing
and singing</b>
<br><b>in my bedroom....we could audibly hear her beautiful soprano voice
(think</b>
<br><b>Mozart's Night Queen aria), her high heeled shoes clacking on the
floor, and</b>
<br><b>her beads rattling (she was always dressed as an upper-class 1920s</b>
<br><b>flapper-girl, complete with a cigarette dangling out of a silver
cig holder,</b>
<br><b>and seemed to be in her late teens). Her other favourite thing to
do was go</b>
<br><b>about the house moving chairs, turning on lights, and cranking the
volume up</b>
<br><b>on the stereo.</b>
<br><b>Lala is precocious, a bit of a wild-child, but has never meant anyone
any</b>
<br><b>harm. More often than not, she's very helpful to us. See, things
are always</b>
<br><b>going missing mysteriously in this house....I'll put my coffee mug
down on</b>
<br><b>the desk, go out of the room to do a chore, then come back and the
mug is</b>
<br><b>gone....things of that nature. Whenever this happens, we ask Lala
to help us</b>
<br><b>find the missing item, and she does. It usually has the same pattern
to it: a</b>
<br><b>few minutes later, I'll hear Lala call my name, turn to face her,
and the mug</b>
<br><b>will be resting placidly somewhere else in the room (where I know
I would not</b>
<br><b>have put it).</b>
<br><b>She also helps to take care of me when my migraine headaches become</b>
<br><b>unbearable, or when I'm sick....just as she used to do whenever
I was sick or</b>
<br><b>had a nightmare when I was a child. She's been with me for 25 years
so</b>
<br><b>far....and though I've told her that she shouldn't feel like she
has to stay</b>
<br><b>with me if she'd rather move on, she continues to remain. I don't
know who</b>
<br><b>she was, since the house was built long after the 1920s (though
we do have a</b>
<br><b>lot of antique furniture and jewelry with which she might have come
into the</b>
<br><b>house, and then decided she liked the inhabitants better ??) and
she doesn't</b>
<br><b>fit the description of any of my ancestors. I only know that it's
a true</b>
<br><b>comfort having my own personal "guardian angel" with me...</b>

<p><b>My First Haunting</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Buddywell@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I WAS ONLY 5 YEARS OLD WHEN I EXPERIENCED MY FIRST HAUNTING. IT WAS
IN MY GRANDPARENTS HOME WHERE I SPENT MANY WEEKENDS ENTERTAINING. I WENT
TO THE UPSTAIRS PORTION OF THE HOME,WHICH WAS THEN ONLY CONSIDERED AN ATTIC
FOR STORAGE. MY OLDER SISTER AND COUSIN WERE CLEANING SO THAT IT COULD
BE REMODELED TO A SEWING ROOM. THIS AREA IS VERY SMALL. ONLY ONE LAMP WAS
THERE</b>
<br><b>TO LIGHT THE AREA. I WAS ALWAYS SCARED OF THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE
ROOM BECAUSE NO LIGHT WAS AVAILABLE THERE. I WENT INTO THIS AREA BECAUSE
MY SISTER NEEDED A BOX TO CONTINUE STORING ITEMS. I WAS ONLY THERE A FEW
MOMENTS WHEN SOMEONE OR SOMETHING SLAPPED MY LEFT CHEEK VERY HARD. I WENT
CRYING DOWNSTAIRS TO MY GRANDMOTHER. I EXPLAINED TO HER WHAT HAPPENED.
SHE SAW THE HANDPRINT ON MY FACE. SHE WENT UPSTAIRS ANGRY AT MY SISTER
AND COUSIN. SHE THOUGHT THEY HAD DONE THIS TO ME. I TRIED TO EXPLAIN TO
HER AGAIN WHAT HAPPENED. SHE DID NOT BELIEVE ME. I STILL TO THIS DAY DO

<br><b>My Story of Aunty Susie</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: LiLiG99@hotmail.com.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>Hello.. I am 22 years old and have had a profound experience. Say
its a</b>
<br><b>preminiton or just having that "sense" I would like to share this
story with</b>
<br><b>others so maybe someone could relate to me and give me some feedback.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; I was about 14 years old.&nbsp; My mothers Aunt Susie raised
her from when she</b>
<br><b>was an infant along with my grandfather.&nbsp; My Aunt never got
married and took</b>
<br><b>on the responsiblity of having my mother.&nbsp; She was truly a
mother compared to</b>
<br><b>my mothers real mother.&nbsp; Anyways, Throughout maybe 4 or 5 years
my</b>
<br><b>grandparents started passing away starting in 1986 with my nana.
The next</b>
<br><b>death was 1988 who was my grandfather (moms dad), and the next to
be&nbsp; was my</b>
<br><b>Aunt Susie.&nbsp; My fathers father would survive six months after
her death.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; Since I was a child I always had strong preminitions and
had even been seen</b>
<br><b>in my sleep talking to something outside my window on a hot summers
night</b>
<br><b>which i remember vividly until this day.&nbsp; My first grandmother
died in 1986 i</b>
<br><b>believe i was 8 or 9 at the time.&nbsp; My parents felt that I was
too young to</b>
<br><b>attend her funeral so I remained at home.&nbsp; A few years later
I had a dream</b>
<br><b>about my nana, coming to me and looking so beautiful wearing a green
dress</b>
<br><b>that I had no knowledge of what so ever.&nbsp; She didnt tell me
but I knew this</b>
<br><b>was the dress she had been buried in.&nbsp; I told my mother what
I had dreamnt of</b>
<br><b>an proceeded to tell her what my grandmother had on when she was
buried.</b>
<br><b>Needless to say my mother almost dropped cause she knew I was so
young I</b>
<br><b>hadnt a clue what went on at the funeral. I was right.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; When i was about 14 years old, My Aunt Susie was still alive
and living in</b>
<br><b>an elderly home in Providence, Rhode Island.&nbsp; She moved out
of the family</b>
<br><b>house shortly after my grandfather passed away in 1988 cause she
was so</b>
<br><b>extremly stricken with grief.&nbsp; My mom and aunt would talk everyday
and I</b>
<br><b>rember this so clearly.&nbsp; It was a friday night and my mom was
trying to call</b>
<br><b>my aunt.&nbsp; Often she would take her hearing aid out and go to
bed.&nbsp; My mom was</b>
<br><b>going to New York the next day with my father and she told me to
get in touch</b>
<br><b>with my aunt the next day and let her know she would be back late
Saturday</b>
<br><b>night and she would call her on Sunday morning.&nbsp; My parents
left at 4 am and</b>
<br><b>I was still sleeping. At around 4:45 am I woke up out of a dead
sleep and</b>
<br><b>shot straight up like as if someone had pinched me. The room was
dark but i</b>
<br><b>felt a very strange uneasy feeling that I was scared.&nbsp; My brother
was</b>
<br><b>sleeping in the other room and I proceeded to get up out of bed
and go</b>
<br><b>downstairs.&nbsp; I for some reason immediatly went to the kitchen
sink, opened</b>
<br><b>the cupboard underneath and grabbed cleaning products out and started
to</b>
<br><b>clean.&nbsp; I have no idea why i did this but I cleaned for a good
two hours.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>was up all day long, my brother went out and i was home alone.&nbsp;
I tried to</b>
<br><b>call my aunt numerous times but no answer.&nbsp; I passed it off
as she may have</b>
<br><b>went out shopping on the bus that day. I still however felt very
uneasy all</b>
<br><b>day long.&nbsp; That night my mother came home and asked me if i
spoke to my aunt.</b>
<br><b>I told her i couldnt get in touch with her. She said alright and
said she</b>
<br><b>would call her in the morning.&nbsp;&nbsp; I awoke around 9 am on
Sunday morning.&nbsp; My</b>
<br><b>mom was in the other room and i overheard her saying I am going
up to my</b>
<br><b>aunts cause she is still not answering the phone. I ran out of bed
and up to</b>
<br><b>my mother and insisted that i go with her. She kind of got mad at
me and</b>
<br><b>wanted me to stay behind but i insisted that I go with her.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The ride up to</b>
<br><b>her house i was getting such strange vibes that when we got there
something</b>
<br><b>wasnt going to be right.&nbsp; WE went into her building and went
to the fifth</b>
<br><b>floor and stepped out. Her apartment was at the end of the hallway.
When we</b>
<br><b>reached the end we saw there were two newspapers lying in front
of her door.</b>
<br><b>One being that of Saturday night and the next being of Sunday morning.
My</b>
<br><b>mother turned to me with such a cold feeling of sadness.&nbsp; She
turned the key</b>
<br><b>into the door and looked to the right. My aunt was lying dead on
the kitchen</b>
<br><b>floor.&nbsp; My mom paniked and i froze. My mother rushed and called
911 and I</b>
<br><b>stared at my aunt. She looked like she had bent over in the sink
to get stuff</b>
<br><b>to clean and she had a heart attack and died. ( As i mentioned earlier
this</b>
<br><b>is what i started to do.) My aunt was facing the cross on the wall
which made</b>
<br><b>it even sadder.&nbsp; I ran out of the apartment and I didnt know
what to do. I</b>
<br><b>was very saddened and very frantic just seeing that.&nbsp; The funeral
came and I</b>
<br><b>wouldnt go near her. I could still smell the stench that prevailed
in her</b>
<br><b>apartment. It was horrible.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; I started not being able to sleep at night thinking my aunts
ghost was in</b>
<br><b>the house and she was going to hurt me. My aunt would never do such
a thing</b>
<br><b>but my mind was so incredibly distraught i didnt know what to do.
I was taken</b>
<br><b>to doctors which couldnt do anything about my sleeping habits for
me. I was</b>
<br><b>driving my poor mother crazy screaming outloud in the middle of
the night for</b>
<br><b>her.&nbsp; Finally i had the dream.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was in a half
of a church if u can imagine</b>
<br><b>that in the middle of a desert. Very windy and dusty.&nbsp; I walked
in and</b>
<br><b>kneeled down at the altar and said a hail mary and our father and
then</b>
<br><b>proceeded to turn around. When i did my aunt was standing right
behind me.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>ran to her quickly and hugged her and she looked the same but a
lil muffled</b>
<br><b>looking in a way. Her skin was a kind of orange color but it was
her.&nbsp;&nbsp; She</b>
<br><b>explained to me that she was very sorry for having me to go through
what i</b>
<br><b>did. She never meant for it to happen and she loved us all. I was
crying in</b>
<br><b>my dream. She said it will all end now and you wont have to suffer
anymore.</b>
<br><b>The way the dream ended was kind of a future preminition... I was
in my papas</b>
<br><b>house who hadnt yet died and i was sitting in his chair. I looked
to the left</b>
<br><b>and down the hallway and saw an extremly bright light illumintating.&nbsp;
I knew</b>
<br><b>he was the next to go after her.&nbsp; I was in fact extremly close
with him.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; Six months later in May 1991, after battling cancer my papa
passed away. I</b>
<br><b>was devistated but at ease in a way. Before they were going to shut
the</b>
<br><b>coffin I ran to it without anyone around. My family was already
outside in</b>
<br><b>the limo.&nbsp; I sat up on the bench and stared down at him and
touched his</b>
<br><b>forehead.. It was warm.. like it had never lost life and the glimpse
on his</b>
<br><b>face was that of a smile.&nbsp; I felt at ease. He was the last
to go.&nbsp; I have my</b>
<br><b>parents who i cherish with my life and I also have my angels that
watch over</b>
<br><b>me. I know they are there and I get warned in my own ways if danger
arises.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; I must say when i awoke from the dream that night, I was
crying and before</b>
<br><b>i could yell out from my mother i saw a black shadow pass outside
my door as</b>
<br><b>if my aunt was there sitting next to me. I screamed for my mother
and told</b>
<br><b>her what happen. I slept every night soundly after that.</b>
<br><b>IF anyone has any comments or similiar stories please email me at</b>

<p><b>My Strange Experiences Up To Now</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: chrell@earthlink.net</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>I grew up in a...shall I say particular(?) household.&nbsp; Its
a very old house and I have no knowledge of its history.&nbsp; but all
my life I always felt as if I was being watched, but I grew used to it.&nbsp;
well, 3 years ago, my grandma-great passed away.&nbsp; I felt retched,
I hadn't visited her while she was in the hospital.&nbsp; I cried and thought
"oh grandma, if only I could say good bye."&nbsp; later that day I was
down in the basement w/ my dog and my mom.&nbsp; my dog started barking
and growling w/his tail between his legs.&nbsp; I silently thought "good-bye
grandma.&nbsp; I'll always remember you."&nbsp; shortly after, we moved
to Lebanon, OH.&nbsp; unfortunately, I did not escape what had followed
me my entire life.&nbsp; I was over at my friends and we were joking around
and said "oooh...I feel a ghostly presence."&nbsp; suddenly, it got cold
and the candles went out.&nbsp; there was no draft, the vents were closed
and the door was too.&nbsp; it was winter so the windows were sealed and
locked.&nbsp; we were shaken, but we regained bravery.&nbsp; my friend,
she has a oiuja board and we asked if we could talk to the devil.&nbsp;
well my fiend got a strangled sensation and couldn't breathe.&nbsp; I got
on my knees and prayed/begged to god to let her live.&nbsp; I was sobbing
and she had turned a very pale blue/mauve shade. it stopped.&nbsp; after
that we prayed and went to bed.no other experiences I have experienced
since... and I am so very thankful.&nbsp; well, that is all up to now;
but I am only 14.</b>

<br><b>My weird story...</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Peluches69@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>My name is Jorge.I am 18 and I've had some weird things happened
to me in</b>
<br><b>short years.My father died about 4 or 5 years ago.I moved with my
sister a</b>
<br><b>while after he died so I could go to school there.When I moved strange
things</b>
<br><b>started happening.I mostly ignored the little things (bed shaking
every</b>
<br><b>night,shadows in the dark,etc).The reason I ignored it was because
my sister</b>
<br><b>and her husband didn't belive me and because after a while I got
used to it</b>
<br><b>and wasn't scared of it.One night I was asleep and woke up because
of a noise</b>
<br><b>I guess,when I opened my eyes there was a woman I could tell was
old.I was</b>
<br><b>scared and paralysed for a split second.She started to say "stay
with her"</b>
<br><b>and thats when I jumped and turned on the light and she was gone.I
told my</b>
<br><b>sister like always and she said she didn't belive me but she had
felt weird</b>
<br><b>things too in the house before (people getting on the bed she was
in,a man</b>
<br><b>asking her where her son was,etc.)I guess she was just scared of
beliving it</b>
<br><b>was true.I tried to get info on the apartment but everyone told
me it was</b>
<br><b>brand new and nothing could have happened there before.I didn't
see anything</b>
<br><b>for awhile but the bed and chairs where I was at night usually still
shaked</b>
<br><b>from time to time.On another occassion I awoke (in the same room
as the last</b>
<br><b>apparition) to find an old man who seemed to be kneeled down next
to me as if</b>
<br><b>to wissper something,he dissapeared before I could hear what he
was trying to</b>
<br><b>say.The next day I tell my sister and husband as always,my sister's
husband</b>
<br><b>proceded to ask me "was it my grandfather?" I found that weird but
it happens</b>
<br><b>that his grandfather died that morning from a heart attack.I would
say it</b>
<br><b>wasn't because I saw the old man before his grand father died in
the</b>
<br><b>morning.I have moved now and the last thing that has happened to
me was not</b>
<br><b>more than a month ago.I awoke in the middle of the night to find
out I could</b>
<br><b>not move and I felt a pressence of evil beside me on the bed and
I could feel</b>
<br><b>he was smiling or grinning and yet I cannot explain exactly how
I knew this</b>
<br><b>since I was facing the other way,I could just feel it,he was jumping
up and</b>
<br><b>down on the bed and there was a light on the closet which the door
is just a</b>
<br><b>few feet off my feet.My sister has told me that I apparently attract
ghost or</b>
<br><b>there is one after me.Since I don't live with her anymore,she says
that the</b>
<br><b>only times she sees weird stuff and feels it is when I'm there,she
also says</b>
<br><b>that it could me my dad because before she died she rubbed his feet
because</b>
<br><b>it was cold in the hospital he was in,she said that one time I was
there she</b>
<br><b>felt someone rubbing her feet and thought it was him.I have also
felt a</b>
<br><b>pressence standing behind me at the end of the best that give out
a feeling</b>
<br><b>of saveness and comfort.Weird things have happened to me alot&nbsp;
but I cannot</b>
<br><b>write about them all because it would take to long.I also suffer
alot of</b>
<br><b>sleep paralysis on which I see apparitions and they are always evil
and scare</b>
<br><b>me even though I am used to seeing things.I would appreciate any

<p><b>Neighborly Haunting</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: dormay2@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>It was in the mid-summer of 99. One sun. morn. I was on the computer
when I</b>
<br><b>thought I heard a gun shot. I looked out the window but didn't see
anything.</b>
<br><b>A few hours later the police and an ambulance arrived at my neighbors
house</b>
<br><b>across the street. All the neighbors were gathered in front of my
house so I</b>
<br><b>went outside to find out what happened and was told that the man
across the</b>
<br><b>street from me was found with a bullet in his head. To this day
no one knows</b>
<br><b>whether he committed suicide or was murdered. The night of the day
he was</b>
<br><b>laid to rest strange things started happening in my home. I would
wake up to</b>
<br><b>find my livingroom light on, one night I was standing in my kitchen
when it</b>
<br><b>came on. This went on untill one night I got angry and yelled at
it to stop</b>
<br><b>and it did, but then I'd wake up and my computer monitor would be
on and</b>
<br><b>this still happens. Also I have a cell phone which I turn off each
night to</b>
<br><b>charge,I wake in the mornings and it would also be on. Just recently
I had</b>

<p><b>Ghost Cat</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: [teedoc@earthlink.net</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have no practical proof of this, but...... my white 2 year old
cat disappeared, and my husband said he thought he seen it up on a road
close to our house, dead in the road of course... well now we see the (ghost)
of our white cat everyday at dinner time.&nbsp; We have an all black cat,
and when he goes to our laundry room at feeding time at night, we see the
white cat walking back and forth in front of the laundry room door, as
if he is waiting his turn to go in and eat dinner.&nbsp; We thought for
the longest time that it was just (our) imagination, but we now have a
roommate that says he also can see the cat, and lots of times you'll be
sitting here in our house and see a white shadow out of the corner of your
eye, and I have had the sensation of a cat jumping up on my bed at night
also....Anyway... Just something kinda creepy I thought I would share.&nbsp;
I really enjoyed the site</b>

<br><b>Ghosts of germantown!</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: baxley@wfeca.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>I would like to tell you of the ghost of Mary Buth. I lived in Germantown
Wisconsin from age 9 to 16. I had two older brothers who used to enjoy
nothing more than to see me curl up in the floor board of the car.First
of let me tell you I was on none believer, Yet a scardey cat! One night
my brothers and some of there friends decided to go to this old house.
Known very well as Mary Buth. Located on a road called Lovers lane.I was
not aware of the story at this time. That night there were many of us so
we had to take several cars. I was placed in a car with 3 guys. When we
turned onto the road the house was on. You could see the police tape all
over the trees and the drive way was blockaded. There was&nbsp; a field
next to the house that went back to a thick tree line. I was already scared
and thought this was stupid. So I was rushing them to do what they came
to do and to go home. The mocho football player type guys wanted to into
the house. I didn't so all the guys went into the but one guy stayed with
me in the car. We drove up and down the road incase police would come buy.
When all the sudden the guy driving the car stopped in the middle of the
rode. He seemed to be in a trans of some sort. He was gazing out the window
next to me on the passenger side. When I turned my head to see what he
was looking at. I seen a little white glowing oval shape that was way back
by the tree line. It was moving towards us. Very fast. I was screaming
like a maniac. But the guy was out of it. Finally I did all I knew to do.
I reached my foot over to the gas pedal. He quickly came thru and began
yelling at me for almost killing him. Mean while the guys were still in
the house. I didn't want to go back and get them. So we waited far down
the road. The next thing we knew all the guys were running down the road.
We quickly went a picked them up. They said they never made it into the
house. But while they were trying to enter a woman appeared in the window.
We decided to see if the figure would come back from the woods again. After
sitting there for a long amount of time we decided to leave. We started
the car up. And to our amazment it did appear. But this time it was right
at the car</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;window looking at us. I have never been so frieghtend in my
whole life. I was closest to the window. I quick got into the floor board
. Praying god to get us out of there fast. But as I was down in the floor
and the guys screaming like girls. I dont think I have ever seen a woman
so beautiful or sad before. She had tears on her cheeks and was wearing
a long white gown. She glowed like a christmas tree. And to this day. I
still dream about that night. I have found out a lot on that haunting.
It seams that that night there was 2 ghosts. One on the outside of the
house and one on the inside. I never went back to that place. In fact I
convinced my parents to move south. I have now been living in Florida for
the last 6 years.But it seems she is still with me in some ways!!!</b>

<br><b>He Called my name... Johanna</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: JEEZABEL25@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I was about six years old when I first encountered ,my&nbsp; ghost.&nbsp;
I was up late</b>
<br><b>watching some t.v.shows. At the time my parents were in the military,
so we</b>
<br><b>lived in military housing. Unfortunately I don't remember what base
it was.</b>
<br><b>Anyway, I felt as though someone were watching me, thinking it was
my mother</b>
<br><b>I turned around and called to her....nobody answered. I turned back
around</b>
<br><b>and continued to watch the show. Not ten minutes later I felt the
strange</b>
<br><b>eyes on me again and this time I turned around to face a figuare
made of the</b>
<br><b>shadows itelf and burning red eyes. It moved slightly from the dark
in the</b>
<br><b>kitchen and sort of leaned over mouthing something I couldn't hear.
Then it</b>
<br><b>was gone. Needless to say that was the last time I stayed up late
by myself.</b>
<br><b>Some years later at anthor post , My parents had told me I was too
young to</b>
<br><b>remember , but we were haunted even then. My small black and white
color</b>
<br><b>television set used to turn on and off&nbsp; byself during times
when I was</b>
<br><b>asleep.</b>
<br><b>Some years later,&nbsp; I was about&nbsp; eleven and we had moved
to a new</b>
<br><b>base...Howard AFB, Panama. (Which was given back to the Panamains
in 98 I</b>
<br><b>think). It was 11:00 pm and I had just finished unpacking. I grabbed
a book</b>
<br><b>and settled in bed. When I heard this scratching noise coming from
my</b>
<br><b>window...at first I ignored it knowing that Panama has bats and
some tend to</b>
<br><b>nest in the houses. The noise continued two more times, what to
see them I</b>
<br><b>looked out my window to see the same black figure with burning red
eyes ,</b>
<br><b>that I saw years before.&nbsp; Only this time I could hear what
it said, "</b>
<br><b>Johanna"&nbsp; He knew my name , he called my name. Then he walked
down the</b>
<br><b>sidewalk and disappeared in to the shadows.&nbsp; Some years later
, I was 17 I</b>
<br><b>was talking to my aunt about this and she that some people can see
angels and</b>
<br><b>others can see demons. To this I firmlly believe that is what I
saw.&nbsp; I have</b>
<br><b>tales of true hauntings which I'll sumbit at a later date. In the
meantime</b>
<br><b>...what do you think it was I saw all those years ago .</b>

<br><b>My Brother..I Hope</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: lizi1desi2@email.msn.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I've been a believer of ghosts since I was about 9 or 10 yr's. old,&nbsp;
when I came across my first encounter with a ghost.I was staying over night
at my aunts house and myself and 3 of my cousin's were sleeping out in
the livingroom on the couch, floor etc., I slept on the floor and for some
reason I woke up, just tossing and turning and noticed a tall man standing
in front of the dining room table, very still, hands at his side, his face
darkened, he worn a dark suit and just watched over us, I laid there scared
stiff and never took my eyes off him then as the light was coming in threw
the big livingroom window with a blink of an eye he was gone. Some time
later at that same home which was an old farm house, I looked out the window
one night while my cousins and i were playing pool and there down in a
field area next to there land was a saucer like object with colored lights
all around, I walked away from the window and never said a word about it
until years later.As an adult later on&nbsp; I had something grab me and
I&nbsp; turned&nbsp; to see nothing there, That was about it ,until I lost
my only brother who died suddenly at the age of 38 yrs. old. My mom , dad,
and myself had phones going dead while were talking to someone, I was waking
up each night at 4:03am and one night I had just turned off the tv at 4am
and turned over to fall asleep when I heard my roommate I thought sneak
in and come to my bedside table to get a cigerette, I lived upstairs at
the time so I waited for my roommate to get a smoke and I then opened my
eyes to see nothing there and yet the floor creaked</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;and walked towards the side along my bed and it stopped at
my head. My brother had passed in the bathroom with water&nbsp; running
and my dad, still gets out of nowhere his phone answering machine a message
when no one has called he gets a message with only running water, doors
open without help, a photo of my brother, just his face is in the bottom
of the dish sink thats filled with water and yet its on the bottom, not
floating and it did not go down the drain it came to my hand and no one
knows how it ended up there. There was so many other things that happened
in the first months and now</b>

<br><b>My Haunted House</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: palpn13@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>My name is Cari and I am a nurse from Pittsburgh PA.&nbsp; I decided
to do some research about ghosts and spirits after some strange things
have been happening at my new house.&nbsp; I have lived here less than
a year and I've had many unexplained things happen here.&nbsp; My email
address is palpn13@yahoo.com.&nbsp; Thank for listening.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A couple of days after moving into my new
house, I took my kids to school and when I came home I decided to go back
to sleep instead of finishing the unpacking.&nbsp; I had only been lying
there for a couple of minutes when I heard someone walking up and down
the attic steps.&nbsp; Thinking that my Aunt had come over to help me finish
unpacking, I got up to go help her.&nbsp; I called her name but she didn't
answer.&nbsp; I went to the attic door but the door was locked from the
outside.&nbsp; Not knowing what it was I chalked it up to new house noises.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A few weeks later I was lying on the couch
one evening after the kids had gone to bed, watching television when I
saw a shadowy figure walk across the kitchen doorway and pass through.&nbsp;
I got up to look but there was no one there.&nbsp; A couple of days later
my Aunt was watching the kids and told me that she was watching television
and saw someone in the kitchen walking around, she thought it was my brother,
although she had not heard him come in, and she got up to go talk to him
but there was no one there.&nbsp; She didn't mention this to me for about
a week after it happened.&nbsp; In the meantime I had been hearing other
strange noises like someone walking in the attic, and up and down the hallway.&nbsp;
I had never told any one about any of my experiences so far because I was
skeptical and sure that there was some other explanation for this.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My Aunt then mentioned to me about&nbsp;
her strange experience in the kitchen.&nbsp; I just got chills because
I had seen the same thing and that's when I told her about everything else
I had experienced.&nbsp; She already believed in ghosts and spirits, but
I did not, although I was starting to believe.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon after moving in my four year old started
having an imaginary friend that she played with in her room.&nbsp; I thought
this was sort of out of character for her, but I thought that I may have
had to do with the move.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many other little things started happening
but they didn't seem menacing.&nbsp; At Christmas we invited over some
people that have lived behind us for 16 years.&nbsp; I didn't tell them
what had been happening, because I didn't want them to think I was crazy,
but I still wanted to find out some history about the house.&nbsp; They
said they think an old woman named Agnes had lived here but she died.&nbsp;
They are not sure if she died in the house or in the hospital though.&nbsp;
Then after Agnes another couple bought the house but the wife died of cancer
very young, like 36 or something.&nbsp; She died in the hospital but she
had loved the house very much.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After those people left I started thinking
about my daughter and her imaginary friend so I asked her about it.&nbsp;
She said her friend was a lady like me.&nbsp; I asked what they did.&nbsp;
She said they played in her room.&nbsp; I asked her where she went when
they were done playing and she said she flies down the steps.&nbsp; This
gave me chills because my daughter is a very serious child and doesn't
usually make things like this up.&nbsp; Her friend stopped coming to see
her soon after this.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everything stopped for awhile.&nbsp; Then
one morning I went into the living room and turned on the switch for the
overhead light but it didn't go on.&nbsp; It was then that I found that
someone had turned the light out by the switch on the ceiling fan.&nbsp;
My brother had been staying with me and I made a mental note to remind
him to turn the light out by the wall switch.&nbsp; Later that evening,
I mentioned it to him but he said he hadn't touched it.&nbsp; That's when
he asked me why I was moving boxes at 2:30am.&nbsp; I said that I wasn't.&nbsp;
He was staying in the basement game and said that he had just gone to bed
when he heard someone come in the front door, drop what sounded like boxes
on the floor then back out and close the door.&nbsp; Whoever this thing
was, it was back.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I started hearing noises again and one
night the cat went behind the nightstand, hissed at nothing, then ran out
of the room.&nbsp; Another time I felt something sit on the side of my
bed while I was trying to sleep, but when I turned over there was nothing
there.&nbsp; Another time I was cleaning the kitchen floor and the kitchen
was pretty chilly, but when I reached for something on the counter I put
my arm through this intense heat.&nbsp; It was just a small area of heat
because my arm was could on either side except for the middle where the
heat was.&nbsp; Then again after that, there was nothing for awhile.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then one night I came home from work very
late, at midnight, and my Aunt was on the verge of hysterics.&nbsp; All
of the lights were on in the house and she was crying.&nbsp; When she calmed
down she told me that she had just finished the dishes around 11pm and
she went into the living room to sit and watch the news when she saw this
bright purple glowing figure peak out from around the dining room wall.&nbsp;
It then stretched out it's arms and started floating into the living room
toward her.&nbsp; She was paralyzed with fear but managed to run outside.&nbsp;
When she came back in the figure was gone.&nbsp; A couple of weeks after
that I came home late again and I was talking to her when the light above
the sink in the kitchen went out.&nbsp; I turned to ask her if she saw
that and the light went back on.&nbsp; I went in and shook the light thinking
that maybe the bulb was loose or there was a short but it didn't go out
again.&nbsp; After this I went next door to talk to my other neighbors
about the happenings.&nbsp; They said that the people who lived there before
me described some of the same things I have.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I decided to look on the web for some help,
when I was home recently and I heard what sounded like heavy furniture
being dragged across the floor upstairs.&nbsp; The cat heard it too because
he ran to the steps but wouldn't go up.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is my strange experiences.</b>

<p><b>The Legend of the Ghostly Lantern Light</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: NovemberGirl22@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;This is a true story about a mysterious ghostly light that
appears on some</b>
<br><b>railroad tracks that I myself and other people who live here that
I know have</b>
<br><b>also witnessed themselves. It all started when I was in the first
grade at my</b>
<br><b>school that our class went on a field trip to this playground in
another</b>
<br><b>nearby city here and at that time, we rode a train to the station
to get to</b>
<br><b>this playground on our field trip. I remember when it was time for
us to go</b>
<br><b>back home, our teacher rounded up all the kids in my class to get
ready so we</b>
<br><b>would not miss our train back home. We were standing at the station
on a</b>
<br><b>platform and I, my teacher and my class kept seeing from a distance
down the</b>
<br><b>train tracks, a flickering light. This was late in the afternoon
and it was a</b>
<br><b>cloudy day and the light would flicker on and off for awhile then
stop only</b>
<br><b>to continue to flicker again. The teacher thought it must be the
light of our</b>
<br><b>train that was soon to come but this flickering light did not move,
it just</b>
<br><b>stayed in one place on the railroad tracks but it was too far away
down the</b>
<br><b>tracks for us to figure out what it was. This light continued for
at least I</b>
<br><b>would say for about a half an hour and I remember us all standing
there</b>
<br><b>thinking our train was on it's way but the train was late and the
mysterious</b>
<br><b>light that was flickering stopped way before our train arrived.
I told my</b>
<br><b>brother about it and he was not a bit surprised because he himself
had</b>
<br><b>witnessed this flickering light at this same train station and some
of his</b>
<br><b>friends. One of his friends was skeptical about it and they decided
to drive</b>
<br><b>out there to this now old train station and they parked near the
train tracks</b>
<br><b>and waited for awhile and sure enough, they both saw this strange
flickering</b>
<br><b>light that night and his friend became a believer but they couldn't</b>
<br><b>understand what this was. We found out later as years went by that
other</b>
<br><b>people who had witnessed this light said that a long time ago, a
man was out</b>
<br><b>walking with a lantern one night by the railroad tracks and it was
very dark</b>
<br><b>out there in the country with all the trees and when the man was
walking with</b>
<br><b>his lantern in his hand, tragically, he was accidently hit by a
train and</b>
<br><b>killed. I have heard different versions to this story and the ghostly
lantern</b>
<br><b>light that we saw that time is supposed to be the light of the man's
lantern</b>
<br><b>he was carrying on that tragic night he was hit by a train. I am
36 now and I</b>
<br><b>don't know if this old train station is still there but perhaps
the railroad</b>
<br><b>tracks where this ghostly light appears is still there. I still
remember that</b>
<br><b>strange flickering light to this day. I also recall that the light
was white</b>
<br><b>and it would get bigger and then smaller as it would flicker. Some
say it is</b>
<br><b>the spirit of the man who was hit by the train and some say it is
the ghostly</b>
<br><b>light of his lantern.</b><b></b>

<p><b>My House Haunted</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: sthompson@ionet.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have lived in my house for about five years now when I first moved
in me</b>
<br><b>and my roomate were sitting in the living room&nbsp; when my 3 year
old Dalmation</b>
<br><b>jumped up and began staring at the corner of the living room the
hair on the</b>
<br><b>back of his neck began to stand up and he started to growl he did
this for</b>
<br><b>about one minute then he slowly turned and began to look over the
television</b>
<br><b>as if he was following something and he continued to growl for another
30</b>
<br><b>seconds. Afew months later during the middle of the night we could
hear the</b>
<br><b>dishes in the cabinets shaking. We didnt think to much of this since
we knew</b>
<br><b>there was a quarry a few miles away and we figured that they may
be</b>
<br><b>blasting. Until we talked to them about their blasting times and
they stated</b>
<br><b>they only blasted in the early afternoons a few years later My roomate
moved</b>
<br><b>out and I got married our young daughter was sleeping in her room
one night</b>
<br><b>when I was awakened by her screaming when I went into her room I
saw her</b>
<br><b>light flashing on and off rapidly. I then turned the light off and
the light</b>
<br><b>went off but immeadiatly came back on while the switch was off and
began</b>
<br><b>flashing again since then items would disappear and reappear in
strange</b>
<br><b>places. the cabinets in the kitchen would be open in the morning
when I had</b>
<br><b>shut the the night before and during the day I would shut the cabinet
doors</b>
<br><b>only to find all of them wide open again a few minutes later when
I was the</b>
<br><b>only one in the house. We recently had a baby and he slept in our
room for</b>
<br><b>the first few months. We attatched a Mobile on his bassinet one
night while</b>
<br><b>my wife was asleep and I was watching TV inour room the mobile turned
on by</b>
<br><b>itself. The mobile played a series of songs then turned off. This
happended</b>
<br><b>three times that night. The next night I was telling my wife about
this and</b>
<br><b>while I was talking about it the Mobile bega to play again on it's
own while</b>
<br><b>it was turned to the off posistion. Since then we moved the baby
into his</b>
<br><b>room and monitored him through a baby monitor which is a top the
line highly</b>
<br><b>sensitive type. Several times while awake at night You can hear
a womens</b>
<br><b>voice on the monitor however you can't make out what she is saying.
Whatever it</b>
<br><b>is seems has been helpful at times one night we left the windows
open and a</b>
<br><b>storm came in over night while we were asleep when I got up the
next morning</b>
<br><b>all the windows were shut neither me or my wife had closed them
during the</b>
<br><b>night. When the Mobile played by itself one of the times the baby
had just</b>
<br><b>began to cry when the mobile started and quickly stopped when he
heard the</b>
<br><b>music. The few thing that I had forgotten to mention the first time
I sent this</b>
<br><b>was the Knocking sounds which just sounds like someone knocking
on the door</b>
<br><b>this usually happens in the early evening around 7-10 Pm. Occasionally
it is</b>
<br><b>later at night but when it happens later it is usually louder and
sounds like</b>
<br><b>it might be in the attic. My daughter has come out of her rooms
numerous times</b>
<br><b>asking if we had called her name and each time both my wife and
I have been in</b>
<br><b>the living room and we hadnt been talking let alone calling her
name. One night</b>
<br><b>I was lying in bed still awake while every one else had been asleep
which is</b>
<br><b>not uncommen since I am used to working night shifts and had recently
changed</b>
<br><b>to days about 6 months ago so I am somewhat of a night owl. anyways
I see a</b>
<br><b>shadow in the living room which you can see the light from the living
room from</b>
<br><b>my bedroom. I figured that it was my daughter who happens to sleep
walk so I</b>
<br><b>went in to check on her and she was not that part of the house.
So I Figured</b>
<br><b>that i was just mistaken then I see a little girl walk right past
my room which</b>
<br><b>looked just like my daughter but I had just looked all over for
her so I got up</b>
<br><b>and looked into her room where she was sound asleep in her bed.
The eerie thing</b>
<br><b>about it was that when the girl walked past my room she looked directly
at me</b>
<br><b>while she was walking but the way the light set up in my house is
I could not</b>
<br><b>see her face clearly and she appeared to be fully dressed however
when I</b>
<br><b>checked on my daughter she was in her nightgown. We have given the
incidents in</b>
<br><b>our house a name"Gertrude" she has never harmed us and on many ocassions
been</b>
<br><b>helpful. Events like these continue to happen almost on a dailey
basis some</b>
<br><b>smaller than other The most recent event happened when we were getting
ready to</b>
<br><b>go to Texas and since there were two cars going down there we were
going to use</b>
<br><b>some radios that I had. I had set them out on the computer desk
the morning</b>
<br><b>before we left but when I got home from work about 1:00pm one of
them was</b>
<br><b>missing I searhced the entire house including the kids room and
even the attic.</b>
<br><b>But it was nowhere to be found. and noone had been home since we
had left for</b>
<br><b>work at 8:00am. So we gave up the search and went on our trip when
we returned</b>
<br><b>my wife was getting her nightgown on and found the other radio in
a drawer in</b>
<br><b>our dresser that I had searched twice and my wife had searched once.
but it was</b>
<br><b>there sitting on top of everything as if someone had placed it there
for us to</b>
<br><b>find. little stuff Like that happens frequently and continues to
this day.</b><b></b>

look up</b>
<br><b>there,(there were four friend's including me.) We all saw it. We
saw a</b>
<br><b>vision on top of the roof of the school, we all saw it go across
then we saw</b>
<br><b>the image yell like a scream and then it fell, we all frightend
buy now so</b>
<br><b>we all ran to our dormatory and went to bed, but did not get much

<br><b>Sensitive</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: M00NDRIFTER@cs.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have several stories to tell, two actually.&nbsp;
For years I thought I was</b>
<br><b>nuts.&nbsp; At times, since my first experience was at the age of
seven, I brushed</b>
<br><b>it off as the boogie man.&nbsp; But my second experience, as an
adult, was</b>
<br><b>experienced by my husband and son too.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) When I was seven years old, we lived in a
three story row home in</b>
<br><b>Philadelphia. I occupied the middle bedroom on the</b>
<br><b>second floor. I know this sounds strange cause in the most famous</b>
<br><b>stories of we usually hear, it's always the third floor that</b>
<br><b>gets haunted.&nbsp; But that wasn't the case.&nbsp; My bed was in
the corner to the</b>
<br><b>left&nbsp; of the doorway.&nbsp; Straight ahead from the door was
a corner</b>
<br><b>containing the doors to my&nbsp; closet, and one leading to the
front bedroom (which had been locked</b>
<br><b>by a skeleton key we&nbsp; did not have.&nbsp; We did not own the
house, we rented it.)&nbsp; My dresser</b>
<br><b>was against the far wall, and the only window was in the far left
corner, adjacent to the door</b>
<br><b>leading to the front room.&nbsp; I'd wake up every night, in the
middle of the night, to see a</b>
<br><b>shadow of human form&nbsp; standing in the middle of my room.&nbsp;
I would scream, and my Mother's</b>
<br><b>boyfriend would&nbsp;&nbsp; come rushing in (at first) .&nbsp; After
a while,</b>
<br><b>this became routine: "Nothing in the closet, nothing&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
under your bed,</b>
<br><b>see that?&nbsp; It was just the boogie man.&nbsp; Go back to sleep."&nbsp;
When he found us</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;nother home to rent in a better neighborhood, we moved out,
and the</b>
<br><b>shadow stopped.&nbsp; I would often sleep in my sisters room when
she was at</b>
<br><b>a friends house, or up on the third&nbsp; floor with my older brother,</b>
<br><b>nothing ever happened in either of those two places.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) This next experience, involves a house on
Fort Bragg, NC.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; We&nbsp; had lived there for about a year or two when</b>
<br><b>this all started.&nbsp; It began with the scent of&nbsp;&nbsp; Baby
powder, and I</b>
<br><b>was the only one experiencing it, at first.&nbsp; After a while,
it involved the</b>
<br><b>computer turning on by itself (and staying on).&nbsp; My husband
and I heard</b>
<br><b>scratches on our&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dining room window, he'd go out
to chase the "cat"</b>
<br><b>away.&nbsp; But when we'd look out the back&nbsp;&nbsp; door, a
straight look to the</b>
<br><b>outside of the window, nothing was ever there.&nbsp; (there was
also a</b>
<br><b>screen over both the lower windows that could only be removed from
the</b>
<br><b>inside.&nbsp; Yet they&nbsp;&nbsp; were never damaged.&nbsp; When
I would walk into my and</b>
<br><b>my husbands bedroom, things&nbsp; would fall off my dresser.&nbsp;
At first</b>
<br><b>we thought it was the floor.&nbsp; But when he walked in a&nbsp;
couple of</b>
<br><b>times on HIS side of the room, things still fell off MY dresser.&nbsp;
The shade</b>
<br><b>on the dining room window flew up on its own when my husband and
son</b>
<br><b>were sitting in the living room, I was not at home.&nbsp; There
was also the</b>
<br><b>time the scent of flowers (I didn't have any in&nbsp; the house),
moved</b>
<br><b>through the dining room, from me to where my husband had just</b>
<br><b>entered.&nbsp; Each of us smelled it for just a brief second, me
first, then him.</b>
<br><b>I was sitting at the computer at this time, and he had just entered</b>
<br><b>the dining room.&nbsp; There were also the scents of different types
of</b>
<br><b>cologne, smelled by my husband in the living room in a single day,
and</b>
<br><b>only on that day.&nbsp; My husband does not wear cologne, and my
son didn't start</b>
<br><b>till a few&nbsp; months later.&nbsp; On day, while looking into
my mirror on</b>
<br><b>the dresser, I saw the image of a&nbsp; woman.&nbsp; She was in
white with</b>
<br><b>curly brown hair (light brown) and it was as though she was standing</b>
<br><b>next to me.&nbsp; She seemed to be looking at me, but when I turned
to look at</b>
<br><b>her, there was no one there.&nbsp; My son, who occupied the other
of the</b>
<br><b>only two bedrooms of this town house, saw a shadow at his doorway
on</b>
<br><b>many nights.&nbsp; He told me that sometimes it would disappear,
and at</b>
<br><b>others it would just go down the stairs.&nbsp; He'd told me that
he has seen</b>
<br><b>this shadow since he can remember, but I thought it might be</b>
<br><b>important to this incident. There was also the incident where I</b>
<br><b>was sitting alone in the living room one Halloween, I had my eyes</b>
<br><b>closed just trying to meditate and relax.&nbsp; I felt the cushion
next to me</b>
<br><b>move, as though someone had sat down.&nbsp; I thought it might be
my</b>
<br><b>son, so I turned to tell him to go&nbsp; back to bed.&nbsp; But
no one was there.</b>
<br><b>Sometimes, in spite of everything.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I often wonder if imagined it, or if I somehow
infected my whole family</b>
<br><b>with insanity.&nbsp; But I want to know.&nbsp; Is it possible for
an individual to be</b>
<br><b>haunted?&nbsp; Even though the apartment we now live in on Fort
Jackson in South</b>
<br><b>Carolina seems "clean" (I don't really think of spirits as "dirty,"
its just</b>
<br><b>for lack of a better word), I still live with the fear that one
day I am</b>
<br><b>going to turn around and this horrible looking being is going to
be standing</b>
<br><b>there.&nbsp; So I want to learn as much about this as I can.&nbsp;
I have been</b>
<br><b>considering going to collage, taking up paranormal psychology.</b>
