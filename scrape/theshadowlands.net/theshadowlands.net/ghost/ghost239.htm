<BR><B>Ghost Or Demon?</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: JaBirdV@aol.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>When I was about 14 my family moved to Asuncion,</B>
<BR><B>Paraguay in South America where my parents served as</B>
<BR><B>missionaries.&nbsp;&nbsp; We rented a house about 5 blocks from</B>
<BR><B>the school my sister and I were to attend.&nbsp; It was a</B>
<BR><B>pretty cool house, my bedroom especially.&nbsp; My bedroom</B>
<BR><B>was unique in that it was a two floor room (meaning it</B>
<BR><B>had an upstairs and downstairs).&nbsp; My bed was on the</B>
<BR><B>bottom floor and my desk and books were on the top</B>
<BR><B>floor.&nbsp; On the top floor there was also a huge walk in</B>
<BR><B>closet/library recessed in the back wall.&nbsp; It was</B>
<BR><B>always a bit eerie walking into this area due the</B>
<BR><B>chills you would get approaching the back of the room.</B>
<BR><B>About three or four nights after moving into the house</B>
<BR><B>I was awakened with a start.&nbsp; Entering my room was a</B>
<BR><B>figure of a man, with his arms stretched out in front</B>
<BR><B>of him, approaching my bed.&nbsp; He looked normal except</B>
<BR><B>that his eyes were missing leaving only the remaining</B>
<BR><B>sockets.&nbsp; His hands were focused towards my neck as if</B>
<BR><B>he meant to strangle me.&nbsp; He was semi-transparent and</B>
<BR><B>had no feet, gliding more than stepping.&nbsp; There was no</B>
<BR><B>sound.&nbsp; I freaked as you can imagine, and pulled my</B>
<BR><B>covers over my head.&nbsp; I peeked out from under my</B>
<BR><B>covers several minutes later and there was nothing</B>
<BR><B>there.&nbsp; I calmed myself down, blaming a possible</B>
<BR><B>dream, and eventually went back to sleep.</B>
<BR><B>About a week later I was again awakened by the same</B>
<BR><B>figure.&nbsp; This time it was not alone.&nbsp; Clinging to the</B>
<BR><B>walls, closets and even the ceiling were black shadows</B>
<BR><B>with yellow eyes that stood about 2 feet tall.&nbsp; These</B>
<BR><B>“creatures” stared at me as the figure approached me</B>
<BR><B>in the same manner as it had previously.&nbsp; The room was</B>
<BR><B>ice cold (remember I am in South America close to the</B>
<BR><B>Amazon…it doesn’t get that cold there) and again I</B>
<BR><B>drew the covers up over my head.&nbsp; Now realizing that I</B>
<BR><B>was wide awake and this was no dream, my heart was</B>
<BR><B>pounding and I peeked out a bit sooner than I had</B>
<BR><B>previously.&nbsp; I was scared more than I had ever been</B>
<BR><B>before.&nbsp; The figure had disappeared but the shadowy</B>
<BR><B>creatures were still there staring menacingly at me.</B>
<BR><B>I pulled the covers back over my head and stayed like</B>
<BR><B>that for the remainder of the night.&nbsp; I don’t remember</B>
<BR><B>falling asleep, but must have at some point that</B>
<BR><B>night, for I remember waking up the next morning</B>
<BR><B>completely freaked out.&nbsp; I told my sister what had</B>
<BR><B>happened, and she thought I had just had a nightmare.</B>
<BR><B>I assured her that I hadn’t, and she just laughed me</B>
<BR><B>off.</B>
<BR><B>This continued to happen for the next several months,</B>
<BR><B>and after awhile I just learned to sleep with my head</B>
<BR><B>under the covers most of the time.&nbsp; I tried to talk to</B>
<BR><B>my folks and sister about it and they just told me</B>
<BR><B>that my imagination was getting the best of me.&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>invited a few friends I had made in school over to</B>
<BR><B>spend the night a couple times.&nbsp; We would sleep in the</B>
<BR><B>upstairs section, and spend half the night watching to</B>
<BR><B>see if anything happened, but nothing showed up while</B>
<BR><B>they were there.&nbsp; My friends just thought I was crazy.</B>
<BR><B>I decided that I would sleep in the upstairs, in a</B>
<BR><B>sleeping bag, and see what would happen.&nbsp; Well,</B>
<BR><B>nothing did.&nbsp; Finally after a few weeks of sleeping on</B>
<BR><B>the floor upstairs, with no episodes, I decided that</B>
<BR><B>whatever it was, it was either over or never really</B>
<BR><B>had occurred.</B>
<BR><B>I was wrong.&nbsp; The first night I was back in my bed I</B>
<BR><B>was awakened again.&nbsp; This time there was not just one</B>
<BR><B>figure, but several figures (both male and female)</B>
<BR><B>approaching in the same fashion single file, one</B>
<BR><B>behind the other.&nbsp; The creatures were back as well,</B>
<BR><B>but this time they didn’t just stare, they laughed.</B>
<BR><B>This time they didn’t stay stationary, they moved as</B>
<BR><B>if they were crawling on the walls, closets and even</B>
<BR><B>up onto the bedposts of my bed.&nbsp; The figures continued</B>
<BR><B>to approach me and just as one would reach me, it</B>
<BR><B>would disappear allowing for the next to approach me.</B>
<BR><B>It seemed that every disappearance brought the figures</B>
<BR><B>closer and closer to me.&nbsp; I don’t know how long I was</B>
<BR><B>laying there, gripped with fear, but I eventually was</B>
<BR><B>able to pull the covers over my head as I had done</B>
<BR><B>previously.&nbsp; This time, however, the covers were</B>
<BR><B>yanked out of my hands and off of my body onto the</B>
<BR><B>floor.&nbsp; I completely lost it and tried to scream, but</B>
<BR><B>no sound came out of my mouth.&nbsp; I grabbed my pillow</B>
<BR><B>and threw it at the approaching figures and b-lined it</B>
<BR><B>out of the room fearing they would follow.&nbsp; I headed</B>
<BR><B>straight for my parents room and woke my father up</B>
<BR><B>yelling that there were demons in my room and he had</B>
<BR><B>to come help me.&nbsp; He tried to make me go back to bed,</B>
<BR><B>but I refused and just kept pleading with him.&nbsp; My</B>
<BR><B>mother finally insisted that he go see what all the</B>
<BR><B>fuss was about, probably just to get me out of the</B>
<BR><B>room, and he reluctantly obliged.&nbsp; I still remember</B>
<BR><B>walking down the hall behind my father, completely</B>
<BR><B>scared out of my mind.</B>
<BR><B>When we reached the bedroom they were all there.&nbsp; The</B>
<BR><B>creatures and the eyeless feet-less figures (5 in</B>
<BR><B>total) were all standing in the room facing me.&nbsp; The</B>
<BR><B>shadowy creatures had an angry look on their face and</B>
<BR><B>the “human” figures just stood with their hands and</B>
<BR><B>arms to their sides.&nbsp; My father literally fell</B>
<BR><B>backwards on me when we entered the cold room.&nbsp; He</B>
<BR><B>immediately woke completely up and told me that he</B>
<BR><B>sensed a severe “oppression”, as he called it, in the</B>
<BR><B>room.&nbsp; He had to drag me to the bed and told me that</B>
<BR><B>he would stay and pray with me until the matter was</B>
<BR><B>resolved.&nbsp; He then got on his knees and started</B>
<BR><B>praying as I just stared back at the imposing figures.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;One by one the figures exited the room through the</B>
<BR><B>door and disappeared as they passed through the door</B>
<BR><B>frame.&nbsp; The shadowy creatures just disappeared through</B>
<BR><B>the walls and the window.&nbsp; My dad stayed with me until</B>
<BR><B>I fell asleep that night.</B>
<BR><B>The figures never appeared again but the shadowy</B>
<BR><B>figures often appeared outside my window at night,</B>
<BR><B>scratching at the pane.&nbsp; I just closed the blinds and</B>
<BR><B>curtains and eventually learned to ignore it.&nbsp; My</B>
<BR><B>family moved to another house about 6 months later and</B>
<BR><B>the occurrence didn’t follow, however I will always</B>
<BR><B>remember it as vividly as if it had happened</B>
<BR><B>yesterday.&nbsp; I only wish to know if what I experienced</B>
<BR><B>was actually a haunting or a demonic encounter.</B>

<BR><B>My Very Own Haunted House</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: lorlo7@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I was just visiting your website and I have a few ghost stories of
my own.&nbsp; I am 16 years old and live in Indianapolis, Indiana.&nbsp;
For many years now I have believed that my house is haunted.&nbsp; My family
and friends agree.</B>
<BR><B>We are the first family to live in the house.&nbsp; Before the neighborhood
was built it was just a field. I have wanted to research the history of
the land but I haven't found anything to even start. My house is not the
only one on my street to experience haunting. My best friend who lives
a few house down from me and her family have said they hear moaning and
footsteps a lot. Also lights turning on and off. Another neighbor told
me about similar things happening in her house. Her dog also is often getting
scared when nothing is happening.</B>
<BR><B>My dad has complained since we moved in 15 years ago about hearing
a radio playing in the vent&nbsp; in our downstairs hallway. He says he
thinks that one of the people who built our house left it there. But still,
15 years later he still hears it.</B>
<BR><B>My parents room, our living room and my room have been the where
most of the strange things happened. My parents sleep with their TV on
so it's not uncommon to hear the TV on in their room late at night. Most
nights one of the kids (there our four of us) would go in and turn it off
for them (waking up my dad once the TV is off) About 5 years ago my sisters
and I were going to bed and we heard the TV on. We were joking about it
and we got in front of their doorway and could even see the light shinning
from it on my parents bed (they were both asleep) When we walked into the
room and over to the TV we saw that it was off. Since then we hear the
TV on and it's really off and see the light of it and it's off. We have
learned to not go in a turn it off.</B>
<BR><B>The most scary thing that I have had happen to me happened a few
years ago. The wall to my closet is also the wall to the closet in my sisters
room. My sister and I have special knocks to talk to each other or to tell
the other to come to the others room. I was in my room one night playing
on my computer and I heard the knock for 'Hello' so I went over to my closet
and said hello back. Then the knock for 'no' I was confused and asked 'what'
back then the knocking became continuous. Like a knocking at the door.
I got scared because I didn't know what my sister was doing and stepped
away from the closet. The knocking got louder and louder and soon turned
into banging. It was then I decided to go yell at sister for scaring me
and I ran out of my room. I heard the banging even in the hall as I ran
to my sisters room. Once I opened the door the banging stopped and no one
was in the room. My parents were downstairs in the kitchen and I asked
them where my sister was. They said that she had left about 20 minutes
before to go to her friends house. As it turned out it was just my parents
and me that night. Both my sisters and brother weren't home.</B>
<BR><B>Another time happened during the day. I was home sick with the flu
and was just getting out of bed. It was around 10 am. I looked out my window
and saw one of the swings on our old swingset swingging. I looked at the
trees thinking it was the wind. It was fall and pretty windy out anyway.
There was a very light breeze, not enough to cause the swing to move on
it's own. The other swing and the other swing type things on the swingset
were still. I went downstairs and into my kitchen and my dog was starring
out the window growling and barking. Then he stopped and walked away. I
looked out there and the swing was completely still. We recently took the
swingset down since we have all gotten older, my younger brother is the
baby of the family and he is 12. My dog will still growl and bark at the
spot where the swing had been.</B>
<BR><B>My sister once told me that she was watching tv one night and felt
the strangest feeling that she wasn't alone.&nbsp; She asked that if anyone
was there to give her a sign. Then the TV turned off on it's own.</B>
<BR><B>We have a old picture of my great-great grandmother in our living
room. Most nights when all the lights are off her eyes will glow blue.</B>
<BR><B>2 or 3 years ago my brothers friend, who is obsessed with ghost
type things decided to play Ouji board in my room after I told him about
the closet thing. We all got on my bed and turned off the lights. He decided
to light a candle I had. He was sitting on the corner of my bed and my
brother and I sat across from each other and we started asking questions
like 'Are there sprits in the room?' like. The room got very cold suddenly
when it had been almost hot just seconds before.&nbsp; The pointer thing
spelt out 'scar' and then my brothers friend flew off my bed backwards.
The candle, thankfully, blew out on the way down. We ran over to him to
see if he was ok and he said it felt like someone had pushed him. I checked
him over to make sure he was ok and his shirt was cold. He lifted it up
and we felt on his chest, there were two very cold spots in the shape of
hands. We also got tape recorder to record any sounds. We eventually ran
from the room screaming due to the answers we were getting about a seven
year old boy who had died there and was telling us about a mean woman in
the house. We went back into the room about five minutes later and got
the tape. When we listened to it in my brothers room we heard strange sounds.
When my brother's friend fell off the bed we heard a scream from a woman
and after we had left the room we heard a little boy saying 'come back
mommy' I gave the tape to my brother's friend and I haven't seen it or
heard it since then. He says he lost it. I don't think I'd ever want to
hear it again truthfully.</B>
<BR><B>A lot of things have happened recently. School just started a few
weeks ago and when I came home from my third day I was alone like I always
before my brother gets home about 15 minutes later. I got a glass from
a down and closed the cabinet door. Then my dog started growling and barked
a few times. I bent down and petted him a few times to calm him down. It
seemed to work and when I stood back up and the cabinet door was open.
I closed it and got my homework out on the kitchen table. I remembered
that I left my calculator in the other room and stood up to go get it.
The cabinet door was open again. After I closed it again it stayed closed.</B>
<BR><B>A few days after that I was taking my dog out for a walk at night.
I was sitting on my front porch and my dog was walking around my yard on
his leash. Then he started growling and barking. I went over to where he
was to see what it was. I saw a white figure run by and disappeared by
the side of my house. I was too scared to see what it was so I grabbed
my dog and ran inside.</B>
<BR><B>The latest thing that has happened took place just a two weeks ago.
I was changing the sheets on my bed and I folded a blanket I use when I
get cold at night and put it on my bed. Then I turned and bent down to
get a pillow. When I turned back around my blanket was unfold and was falling
off my bed.</B>
<BR><B>My best friend and I also have video of us in my room. We watched
it in slow motion after we thought we saw something. There are white orb
type thing floating around. Even my parents said it was too big to be dust.</B>
<BR><B>Well that is about all. I was hoping maybe someone could tell me
how I could begin to doing research on the area that I live in. It would
be greatly appreciated. The ghost, if there is really one, is not mean
or even threating. My family actually have gotten very used to it. I would
just like a little explanation.</B>

<BR><B>My Supernatural Story</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: ProjectShadow316@aol.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>My name is Chipper.&nbsp; There is this former hotel named Wentworth
By The Sea in</B>
<BR><B>New Castle, New Hampshire.&nbsp; My friend Will, sister Amanda,
and one of her</B>
<BR><B>friends Jessica went there one night at about midnight.&nbsp; No
one is allowed</B>
<BR><B>inside because it is being renovated so it may be opened into the
hotel it</B>
<BR><B>once was.&nbsp; Anyway, this one night has been burned into my memory
for</B>
<BR><B>eternity.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It started like any other night before it.&nbsp;
Warm weather ( about 75-80</B>
<BR><B>degrees, partly cloudy) and we parked the car and got out and did
our normal</B>
<BR><B>rounds, looking for anything unusual.&nbsp; We didn't have to wait
long.&nbsp; Almost</B>
<BR><B>the second we got to the fence, we heard a door slam shut.&nbsp;
We ran down to</B>
<BR><B>the far side of the house where there was a door left open, as usual,
but</B>
<BR><B>this time it was shut.&nbsp; Not knowing if this is what we heard,
we waited.</B>
<BR><B>There was a strong breeze blowing that would indicate that any door
left</B>
<BR><B>slighty open would remain open because of the wind.&nbsp; This would
not be the</B>
<BR><B>case this night.&nbsp; Just before we walked toward the other side
of the house,</B>
<BR><B>we saw the door swing open and hit the house, like physics would
allow.</B>
<BR><B>However, about a minute later, all of us saw the door slam shut
faster than</B>
<BR><B>it had opened, while the wind was at its maximum velocity at that
point and</B>
<BR><B>time.&nbsp; This repeated a few more times, with the wind blowing
or not.&nbsp; We knew</B>
<BR><B>something was going on, so my sister and friend went out back to
see if they</B>
<BR><B>could see anything, while me and Jessica stayed out front.&nbsp;
About 3 minutes</B>
<BR><B>later, we heard a sound like a flag or a cape blowing in the wind
right</B>
<BR><B>behind us, and we turn around and nothing is there.&nbsp; We began
to freak out a</B>
<BR><B>bit.&nbsp; We my sister and friend returned, we left dropping of
Jessica but</B>
<BR><B>picking up my friend's girlfriend, Robyn.&nbsp; We returned at about
1 o'clock in</B>
<BR><B>the morning, and Will got a briliant idea (sarcasm) He wanted to
try to</B>
<BR><B>become a medium for the spirits of the hotel.&nbsp; He puts his
hands on the</B>
<BR><B>fence, but nothing happenend.&nbsp; We all did the same together
and started to</B>
<BR><B>hear a paint can clanking on the ground, but moving around like
it was on</B>
<BR><B>someone's foot or it was being banged around out of boredom.&nbsp;
We all took our</B>
<BR><B>hands off the fence, except for Robyn, who couldn't take her right
hand off.</B>
<BR><B>Now, Robyn isn't strong at all, and normally Will can pry open her
hand</B>
<BR><B>whenever he wants.&nbsp; This time, however, was differerent.&nbsp;
Will ALL of us</B>
<BR><B>trying to pry open her hands, we failed.&nbsp; She eventually managed
to let go,</B>
<BR><B>and her hand was cold as ice, while the rest of her body was warm.&nbsp;
The fence</B>
<BR><B>was warm too, so it couldn't have been the fence alone to cause
her hand to</B>
<BR><B>become cold.&nbsp; To top it off, it had begun to rain.&nbsp; So
we started to leave</B>
<BR><B>but we we got to the other side of the road, it wasn't raining,
just in the</B>
<BR><B>area of the hotel.&nbsp; We took off at MACH 3 and haven't been
back since.</B><B></B>

<P><B>My Story</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:brunbette@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hi,</B>
<BR><B>Before I start I'd like to say your site is brilliant, keep up the
good work! I am 18 and currently living with my parents in Birmingham (England)
and I have had what I think are a few paranormal experiences. About a year
ago I was having trouble with my parents so I decided to take a time out
from living with them, I decided to move in with my aunt. Now my aunt runs
a pub with her boyfriend, and both them and their 2 young children live
above this 30 year old public house. This pub has many ghost stories attached
to it and although some where very convincing I never really believed there
was a presence till I felt it myself.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I had only been living there for about a week when things started to happen,
Charlie (the name of the ghost whom we think is the last landlord who died
there) was a very playful man who seemed to think it was great fun scaring
people. He would move my hairdryer around when I was late for work, or
throw things around my bedroom when I walked past. lights would go on and
off and the microwave would ping when nothing was in it. I got used to
these occurrences and in time felt quite comforted when he was around,
until one night when Charlie was in a very destructive mood. Charlie sometimes
went over the top and broke things, on this particular night he was switching
the bathroom light on and off when the bulb blew up. I got very annoyed
with this as I was using the mirror and shouted at him to stop, and told
him to leave us alone and find someone else to hassle which he did not
take kindly to. from that day Charlie became scary, he would throw things
at me while I was walking past the bedroom or if downstairs in the pub
he would move pictures and throw snooker balls. Finally I had had enough
and spoke to my aunt about him, she told me he was annoyed with me for
asking him to leave his home and that he had been appearing to her in the
cellar looking very angry.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After about
3 weeks I moved back into my parents house but Charlie still continued
to terrorise my aunt and her family, so they recently moved out. Since
Charlie I have discovered strange things in this house that I had dismissed
as a child, but I'll tell you about that another time. Thank for listening
to me as my mother thinks I have an overactive imagination and does not
believe me.</B>

<BR><B>My Parents House</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: sandradee98_98@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>My sister and I have been trying to decide whether or not to send
in this story and now I think that it is time.</B>
<BR><B>My sister, Candace, &amp; I moved here with my older brother and
parents about 12 years ago. WE bought a house in Kennesaw, GA. In case
you don't know your history, Kennesaw is one of the major places that the
Civil War took place. Anyways, my parents house is about 5 miles from the
Kennesaw Mountain National Battlefields. So you can just imagine all of
the activity around there!</B>
<BR><B>Eversince we moved in, there has always been a feeling of awareness
around that house. As though someone is watching you, you know? It didn't
get bad until I was about 12 years old...things just disappearing and reappearing
and such in other places. The norm for a poltergiest or whatever it is.
So then things started appearing to both me and my sister but we were both
just too scared to talk about it with anyone. I would see the shadow of&nbsp;
a man walking around the house when no one was there. My sister would feel
a presence in the bathroom when she was taking a shower.&nbsp; Our cats
would not and I mean absolutely would not go to a certain cornr in my room.
It was always creepy seeing them stare at something that wasn't there and
have them get freaked out. Then I started to see a shadow of a man in the
shower while I was bathing. It would be steaming hot in the bathroom and
I would get a chill that would cut right through me and all the hair on
the back of my neck would stand on end. I would tur</B>
<BR><B>My mother was also a witness to these occurences. One day, she was
in the kitchen with me and she thought that my father had come down the
stairs. She started to call his name and when he didn't answer, we searched
the entire downstairs. No one was there! My dad was in the bathroom in
their bedroom at the other end of the house. There was no way that he could
have made it back upstairs without one of us seeing him! So that made my
mother a believer!</B>
<BR><B>I recently got married and moved out of their house. So all of the
next occurences have been happening to my sister. My parent recently went
on a trip to Savannah and my sister was left to her own devices for about
3 days. She's a capable 19 year old so it was not anything new to be left
alone in the house. She started to have the feeling that something was
following her around the house. She was feeling watched and then things
started to happen. Lights would go on and off by themselves. She woke up
to the dishwasher being on(it was empty!) at 3 am and all the kitchen lights
being on. She was working out and her dog was pacing the entrance way with
his head looking up, like he was watching something pace and was following
it. She asked it to go away...and it did. But it moved over to the stereo...and
the door to the cabinet that has to be push released by a magnet spring
lock opened by itself. She left the house after that.</B>
<BR><B>All in all I have accepted the fact that my parent house is haunted.
I actually kind of like it! I know that he is not there to hurt anyone
and that he just wants us to know that he is there.</B>

<P><B>My Own Stories</B>
<BR><B>By: Anonymous</B><B></B>

<P><B>After reading almost your entire website, I am convinced of my sanity.&nbsp;
I wanted to share a few haunted happenings from my own past; perhaps I
can help others realize they are just as sane as I am!&nbsp; First let
me say that I am a molecular cell biologist - I am a scientist.&nbsp; I
am not prone to fantasy, but in my lifetime I have come to learn that not
everything that we experience can be logically explained by our current
knowledge system.&nbsp; Being a scientist, I am not religious.&nbsp; Even
growing up as a Catholic, religion was never forced down my throat by my
parents and as I grew I chose to ignore religion altogether.&nbsp; I believe
that as humans, we will always look to some higher power - god or whatever
- that is in charge of things we can't control.&nbsp; The early hunters
and gatherers from 80,000 years ago believe in sacrificing to the sun and
earth gods, and nothing much has changed till present time other than most
religions have decreased their gods to just one.&nbsp; I refuse to worship
some unknown god, although I do believe there are higher powers out there
that we don't understand, and may never understand.</B>
<BR><B>ONE:</B>
<BR><B>My first recollection is from when I was still sleeping in a crib.&nbsp;
The house I grew up in was built in 1863 as a two room home; kitchen and
a living room/bedroom.&nbsp; Two other rooms and a full basement were added
in 1902, and an upstairs was added in 1920.&nbsp; There were no hallways;
downstairs was a simple square divided into four small rooms.&nbsp; In
1924 an upstairs closet was turned into a tiny bathroom.&nbsp; The house
was built by a great grand father, and remained in the family until my
father's death in 1983 when we sold it.</B>
<BR><B>I was born in 1953.&nbsp; My parents' bedroom was off the living
room, both rooms facing the street.&nbsp; My "room" was actually what we
used as a dining room, my crib being placed next to the wall adjacent to
my parents' bedroom.&nbsp; My first memories are still vivid.&nbsp; Being
a baby I remember waking frequently during the night, fussing, wet, looking
for a bottle.&nbsp; An elderly woman, very stern face, in a long dress,
would come to me.&nbsp; Sometimes she would change me (yes, I do remember
this!), sometimes she would freshen my bottle for me.&nbsp; Sometimes she
would rub my back until I went back to sleep.&nbsp; I don't ever remember
her saying anything though - perhaps this is a result of my not even being
able to talk yet, so I wouldn't remember or understand her words anyhow.</B>
<BR><B>I remember finally getting a real bed.&nbsp; I must have been about
three or so.&nbsp; One morning my mother came in to wake me up early.&nbsp;
I don't know why.&nbsp; I was wet.&nbsp; I remember my mother being very
upset with me!&nbsp; I remember trying to tell her that the "lady" didn't
come last night.&nbsp; That was pretty much all I could provide in the
way of explanation, but for my entire life thus far, I never remembered
my mother coming to me in the middle of the night; just this elderly lady.</B>
<BR><B>I don't remember much for the next few years, but I do remember
at age 6 we were planning a vacation to the Catskills.&nbsp; I had never
spent a night away from home.&nbsp; The elderly lady still visited me occasionally
during the night, which I thought was the most normal thing in the world,
and my only concern about going away for this vacation was "is the lady
coming with us"?&nbsp;&nbsp; My mother then started to take notice of my
frequent mentions of these nocturnal visits.&nbsp; She asked me what this
lady did, and what she looked like.&nbsp; I remember very matter-of-factly
telling her what the woman looked like and explained her dress and what
she had done for me - for years!&nbsp; I remember the next thing my mother
did was scream for my father who had started putting suit cases in the
car for our departure the next morning.&nbsp; He came running into the
kitchen where we were sitting and my mother said, "Nanna comes to see Marie!"&nbsp;
It wasn't until years later that I learned that Nanna was my mother's stepmother
who had died in 1930 in that house.&nbsp; In what was my bedroom.&nbsp;
The dress I described was one she wore every day and only washed on "washday"
when she would dawn a house coat.&nbsp; My mother found old family photos
of Nanna to show me when I was 15.&nbsp; The thought of a ghost taking
care of me as a baby put chills down my spine!</B>
<BR><B>TWO:</B>
<BR><B>Once I turned perhaps 14 or so, I was given a bedroom upstairs.&nbsp;
There were only two, and my great aunt had moved in with us, sharing the
room next to mine.&nbsp; One piece of furniture in that room had been a
1940 RCA floor model radio that hadn't worked in years my mother said.&nbsp;
It was used really as nothing more than a bureau of sorts for me to put
my pictures and lipsticks on.&nbsp; The electrical cord had long ago been
removed.&nbsp; One evening I was awoken by staticky sounds, and voices.&nbsp;
I woke up enough to realize the voices were coming from this old radio!&nbsp;
I was more intrigued than scared, and listened intently (for 8 minutes
according to my bedside clock radio) as "Amos and Andy" played out over
the airwaves.&nbsp; I heard a commercial for Lux Soap, and the announcer
talking about a swing band coming to the Coconut Grove in Boston the following
Saturday!&nbsp; Then - it stopped.&nbsp; It was only then I understood
what a strange thing had happened - I had been listening to an old radio
show from years before!</B>
<BR><B>I ran downstairs and woke up my parents.&nbsp; They weren't pleased,
but they could see I was almost panicked.&nbsp; I explained exactly what
had just happened.&nbsp; I asked them what Lux Soap was, and asked about
the Coconut Grove.&nbsp; I told them the old radio in my room had been
playing for a while.&nbsp; I remember my mother saying "Oh my God!"&nbsp;
She turned on her bedside light.&nbsp; She told me Lux Soap was an old
product from radio days and had lots of radio commercials.&nbsp; She told
me Amos and Andy was an old radio show and she and her father used to sit
in the living room listening - on that radio! - to this show every week.&nbsp;
She also told me about a huge devastating fire at the Coconut Grove Night
Club in Boston in 1942 - where we lived - and how she had been there the
night before it burned to ground killing almost everyone inside.&nbsp;
These were things I had no way of knowing about myself.&nbsp; I could not
have somehow heard about these events and then re-invented them in some
sort of dream.&nbsp; My mother then ran up to my bedroom to see this radio
for herself.&nbsp; Even though I couldn't have made any of this up, she
didn't really believe me.&nbsp; She touched the radio and found it very
very warm....&nbsp; the old tubes produced much more heat than the later
transistors and then later chips.&nbsp; She sat in the kitchen for the
rest of the night smoking.&nbsp; My father took the radio to the cellar.</B>
<BR><B>THREE:</B>
<BR><B>After I moved out and got married, 1972, my husband and I moved
into a small apartment near my college campus.&nbsp; One night after we
had gone to bed I heard a loud scratching sound right under our bed.&nbsp;
The apartment had wall to wall carpeting so this made it even more obvious.&nbsp;
I could see my husband was wide awake and I asked if he heard what I did.&nbsp;
He said, yes.&nbsp; He also refused to get out of bed to look under it!&nbsp;
This went on all night long; neither of us slept a wink.&nbsp; When the
alarm went off in the morning we decided it was safe to get up.&nbsp; The
sun was up and everything looks better in bright daylight!&nbsp; Even though
the last scratching sound was heard only an hour before, we both thought
we had dreamed it.&nbsp; As I showered, however, he decided to actually
look under the bed....&nbsp;&nbsp; My shower curtain was abruptly hurled
back, which scared me enough!, and he almost dragged me dripping wet into
the bedroom where I saw that he had moved the bed aside to reveal a severely
ripped carpet!&nbsp; The carpet appeared to have been sliced with a sharp
object over and over - the entire length of the bed.&nbsp; We moved the
next day - and our landlord kept our security deposit to replace the "damaged"
carpeting!</B>
<BR><B>FOUR:</B>
<BR><B>After a divorce a few years later, 1979, a friend of mine invited
me to spend the weekend with her in Maine at her beach front cottage.&nbsp;
I gladly accepted.&nbsp; On Friday afternoon I stopped on the way north
to enjoy some delectable fried clams, and continued on to the house, arriving
about 6:00 that evening.&nbsp; There was a message on the answering machine
from my friend Meg explaining that her car battery had died and she wouldn't
be able to join me until Saturday after it was replaced.&nbsp; I unpacked
the few things I brought and sat down with a glass of wine and a good book.&nbsp;
Within a half hour or so I started to feel awfully nauseous and blamed
it on the clams I had eaten a few hours before.&nbsp; By 9:00 I was lying
prostrate on the bathroom floor, barely able to raise my head.&nbsp; I
had the presence of mind, however, to drag the phone into the bathroom
with me, silently blessing Meg for equipping that thing with a 50' cord!&nbsp;
I called Meg and explained my plight.&nbsp; She said she would immediately
alert her neighbor, Helen, who was a retired nurse, to come over.&nbsp;
Helen had a key, and I wasn't to worry about a thing.&nbsp; Meg reassured
me of her arrival the following morning.</B>
<BR><B>I must have passed out or fallen asleep because I was awoken by
the whistling of the tea kettle in the kitchen, and someone walking around
and humming.&nbsp; I obviously credited this presence to Helen, the neighbor.&nbsp;
I called out to Helen to let her know I was helpless on the floor of the
bathroom, and I heard a delicate female voice respond in a slight Scottish
accent, "Don't worry, dear, I'm making ya some tea and I'll leave it aside
the door for ya..don't want to bother ya.&nbsp; I'm bringing ya some scones
in the morning to put some food into ya tummy.&nbsp; I'll just keep myself
busy here till ya feel like coming oot."</B>
<BR><B>I remember crawling to the bathroom door and there was a wonderful
steaming cup of tea laced with honey and a few other herbs I couldn't quite
place.&nbsp; Once I finished this, my tummy actually felt better.&nbsp;
I walked back to my bed and fell asleep, never trying to find or meet Helen.&nbsp;
Once during the night I awoke to the sound of someone walking into the
room, only to find more tea on the bedside table, which I happily gulped
right down.</B>
<BR><B>I awoke the next morning feeling much better.&nbsp; I went to the
kitchen to find another cup of steaming tea, with a plate of blueberry
scones.&nbsp; I ate all four of them and wanted to walk next door to thank
Helen for her kindness, but I didn't know which side to walk to... no houses
were visible.&nbsp; I decided to shower, and I no sooner had gotten dressed
than Meg showed up with groceries and medicine for me.&nbsp; I told her
how much better I felt and all the wonderful things Helen had done for
me, and how I had finished all the scones she had brought over.&nbsp; I
wanted to go to her house to thank her personally.</B>
<BR><B>I will never forget the look on Meg's face when I finished talking.&nbsp;
She told me she wasn't able to reach Helen last night; she wasn't picking
up her phone, so she left Helen a message.&nbsp; She even drove by Helen's
on the way here to find a few days worth of newspapers and mail ---&nbsp;
so Meg went in with her key.&nbsp; Helen had apparently had a heart attack
and died in her sleep a few days before.&nbsp; The police were there now.</B>
<BR><B>It seemed like Helen was still able to listen to her messages from
the beyond, and was still nursing others back to health, although she could
do nothing to help herself.</B>
<BR><B>I told Meg everything that had happened.&nbsp; I still believe the
only reason she paid any attention to what I said was the fact that Helen's
empty plate remained on the kitchen table - with a few crumbs left from
the hot blueberry scones she made me.</B>
<BR><B>FIVE:</B>
<BR><B>I was buying a used car for my daughter in 1992.&nbsp; We were at
a used car lot and she spotted an attractive Mustang that she fell in love
with.&nbsp; Having had one myself, I couldn't deter her from choosing such
a tiny sports car.&nbsp; We asked the salesperson to get the key so we
could take it for a test drive.&nbsp; My daughter followed him to the showroom
to use the ladies room and I stood by the car. I remember it was almost
90 degrees outside, yet I suddenly felt ice cold.&nbsp; I thought perhaps
the air conditioning system from the building was blowing on me....or something
of that sort.&nbsp; I turned and saw a man standing on the other side of
the car, dripping wet, with grass or something of the sort in his hair.&nbsp;
He was wearing a suit, yet he was soaking wet.&nbsp; His mouth was moving,
yet I couldn't hear him.&nbsp; He looked very distraught.&nbsp; This image,
however, didn't scare me.&nbsp; I was mainly trying to figure out why this
wet man was standing there, and how did he get so wet?&nbsp; I was ready
to ask him when I heard my daughter's voice.&nbsp; I turned and realized
this wet man had gone.</B>
<BR><B>A voice of some sort inside my head kept repeating "car went off
the bridge"... and I couldn't ignore it.&nbsp; I asked the salesman about
the history of the car, and how he had gotten it.&nbsp; I asked who had
turned it in...&nbsp; He didn't give me a straight answer but alluded to
having purchased it from a wholesaler.</B>
<BR><B>I told my daughter we needed to leave, and even told her what had
happened in the car.&nbsp; She didn't question me.&nbsp; She did however,
have a friend who worked for the police department.&nbsp; After a few days
of research we found out that this Mustang had gone head first off a bridge
in Georgia, been recovered and restored, and was ultimately purchased by
this dealership in Lynn, MA.&nbsp; If we had bought this car, we would
have bought all sorts of trouble.&nbsp; We also learned that the person
driving, a Mr. Henderson, had been coming home from work, and was drowned
before help could arrive.</B>

<P><B>Lifelong Experiences</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:lilith_shadow@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>This might end up being kind of long, since I am going to try to
cover a lot of what I have experienced in my life. I will start with the
first thing that I remember. I was about 4 or 5 years old. I was sitting
in my bedroom getting some coloring books. It was summer and the window
was open. I heard this noise, and at first I couldnt tell where it was
coming from. I looked towards the window and the sound faded. It sounded
sort of like a lawnmower. Well I went back to what I was doing, and the
noise just got louder. I realized the noise wasnt coming from my window,
but from the other side of my room, where the closet was. I looked over,
and saw this black orb hovering over the moulding of the closet. It was
moving in this swaying motion, and the noise I was hearing came from the
black orb. I screamed and curled up into a ball. I continued to scream
until my mom reached my bedroom. She looked terrified, and kept asking
me what was wrong. Well my little brain could only assume it was a black
bee, which she didnt find amusing. She said she thought someone was trying
to kill me Because of how I was screaming.</B>
<BR><B>From that point on I read everything I could get my hands on about
ghosts. Nothing happened for many years after the first incident.</B>
<BR><B>My father was in the military, and we were moved from Alaska to
Minot North Dakota my sophmore year of high school.&nbsp; I am not going
to get into everything that happened down there, since it was a daily occurance
down there, no matter where in town I was. In brief, lets just say the
blacker than black negtive things.&nbsp; Everywhere. Luckily, the people
that I normally hung out with saw them too, so I didnt feel like I was
going crazy. They ranged in height from 1 foot to over 7 feet. There was
one we nicknamed "splittoes." Keep in mind, there were more than one of
them. I lived in Minot for just under one year, and I will never step foot
there again. On top of the shadows, there were many other things that happened
ranging from smells, to noises, to the absolute feeling of being chased,
the fear. My sister even saw them, though it traumatized her so badly she
shut down and now says she didnt. Now I know this sounds crazy, but I know
there are other people out there that have experienced these things. I
know that what happened down there was not an overactive imagination. We
all from time to time, would wake up with cuts we couldnt explain, or had
them appear out of nowhere.&nbsp; Sometimes singular, sometimes looking
like a tiny clawed hand had hit us, and rarely bite marks. We were told
by a friends mother to wear sage in little leather bags for protection.
I still wear one. even though I am back in Alaska.</B>
<BR><B>After Minot, things slowed down a lot. I had a few more experiences
with the shadows, after a while I had enough. I yelled at them and told
them if they agreed to leave me alone, I would pretend they didnt exist.
And it has been quiet pretty much ever since.</B>
<BR><B>The last time I had an experience like that was out in Cooper Landing,
Alaska just a few years ago. I left Minot almost 8 years ago.&nbsp; My
friend invited me and a few other people to her parents cabin for the night.
We drove out there ffrom Anchorage at around 8pm, in the winter. I dont
know if your familiar with Alaska's seasons and such but in the winter
its hardly ever light out, maybe a couple hours a day during the time period
we went out there. So anyways we drive out to Cooper Landing in the dark
on really icy roads. We finally get out there and at first sight this place
made me nervous. I was determined to have a good time, so I forgot my initial
feeling on the cabin.&nbsp; The night went well. The cabin was set up in
a very open layout. There was a wall that went halfway across in the middle
of the cabin, with the living room on one side and three sets of bunk beds
on the other. Come to find out it used to be her grandmothers cabin before
she died. Well we all decided to go to sleep. My friend and her boyfriend
pulled out the futon in the living room and went to sleep. Me and my boyfriend
wer lying on the bunk bed where we could look into the side of the cabin
where the living room was.&nbsp; We were just talking, and all of a sudden
we started to hear this noise. It started by the living room, but outside
and worked its way around the cabin, but the noise would continue to come
from everywhere it had already been. It was sorta like wailing. It reminded
me of what a banshee might sound like. I was really freaking out and asked
my boyfriend what the hell that was. He said it was a ghost crying. I looked
out to where the living room was and this thing started to appear. Starting
at the top and kinda whirlwinding down. My boyfriend saw it and leapt to
the bunk bed directly across and was freaking out. I started demanding
he go and turn on the light and wouldnt stop until he did. Finally he did,
and the thing disappeared. My friend woke up and told us things like that
always happen out there and we just needed to get used to it. I was really
upset she didnt tell me.&nbsp; Neithor me or my boyfriend could sleep till
it got light outside.&nbsp; Nothing else happened that night, but I have
no desire to try my luck again.</B>
<BR><B>Since then, I havent had any encounters with anything that appeared
as a shadow. I have seen ghosts, that appear like people look, in color,
and they dont scare me at all.&nbsp; I'm not sure what the black things
are, and I am not sure I want to know. I do know that as long as I dont
think about them, I dont have any problems with them.</B>
<BR><B>Oh, I almost forgot. Eklutna is another really creepy place up here.
Not the cemetary, but the village, or whats left of it. I only got to spend
about 15 minuted out there, but that was more than enough to feel it out.
Very bad vibes out there. And as we were leaving, I saw something back
in the trees. As soon as I looked at it, it darted behind a tree. It was
dark out so I dont know what it was, but it dodnt look like a person.&nbsp;
An when we were driving back to Anchorage, on the outbound side of the
highway there was an accident and this huge bull moose was on the side
of the road dead, but none of the vehicles looked like they had hit it.
A moose hitting your car would crumple it like a soda can.</B>
<BR><B>I was supposed to send you guys some pictures back in 1999, and
i put them in an envalope on my dresser and when I went back to get them
so I could mail them to you the whole envalope was gone, I still havent
found the pictures. Weird.</B>
<BR><B>Well, thats all I have for this morning, maybe sometime I'll go
more in depth about my experiances in Minot. But not yet, I dont like talking
about it when its dark outside.</B>

<BR><B>My Haunting</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: ItalianPrincEz4@aol.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>It all started when I was about 2-3.&nbsp; There was a thunder storm
and i hate</B>
<BR><B>storms, so I went to my parents room across the hall.&nbsp; After
the storm was</B>
<BR><B>over, I decided to go back to my room.&nbsp; When I got to the doorway,
I saw 2</B>
<BR><B>figures sitting in 2 of my chairs.&nbsp; I had a little table and
tea set in the</B>
<BR><B>middle of my room, and they were sitting there.&nbsp; I wasn't sure
if it was</B>
<BR><B>real, so I knocked on my door.&nbsp; The one who's back was facing
me slowly</B>
<BR><B>turned around 2 look at me.&nbsp; It was white--kinda fuzzy looking(like
the way</B>
<BR><B>your tv looks when it gets all snowy in the tv set), and it had
2 balck holes</B>
<BR><B>where the eyes should be, and an outline of the nose and mouth.&nbsp;
I got scared</B>
<BR><B>and ran and told my father I saw my grandpa, even though my grandafther
was</B>
<BR><B>deceised.&nbsp; I later found out that an old couple originally
lived in the hosue</B>
<BR><B>before my parents bought it in the 70's.&nbsp; The original house
was small--- 2</B>
<BR><B>bedrooms, a kitchen and a small living room.&nbsp; It was only one
story, and when</B>
<BR><B>my aprents moved in, they said the old man died.&nbsp; They heard
voices a few</B>
<BR><B>times, but didnt think anything of it.&nbsp; Then when me and my
brothers were</B>
<BR><B>born, they built a basement and second story, where the bedrooms
are.&nbsp; My</B>
<BR><B>bedroom and my parents bedroom are right above the original part
of the</B>
<BR><B>hosue.&nbsp; My room used to be the attic until we built the upstairs.&nbsp;
I think</B>
<BR><B>the ghosts were my grandfather and the old man.&nbsp; But i keep
seeing the same</B>
<BR><B>ghost when I go places.&nbsp; Im never scared though.&nbsp; Also,
we have had things</B>
<BR><B>fly across the room, things shatter out of nowhere, hear noises--and
i have</B>
<BR><B>had experineces where I felt a presence in the room and then I saw
a creese</B>
<BR><B>in the couch right next to where I was sitting.&nbsp; Im not scared
though because</B>
<BR><B>I just have a feeling they dont itnend on hurting me.&nbsp; It actually
makes me</B>
<BR><B>feel safer at times.</B><B></B>

<P><B>My Ghost Story</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Charris@sc.rr.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Well my mom,dad,brother, and i had just moved into our new home and
we went looked at the rooms. The room in the very far back next to my room
had 3 bullet holes in the window, and on my moms closet there was red stuff
that had been running down the door. We didnt know what it was, but we
werent gonna think it was someones blood. It was like a year later my neighbor
chris,my mom,dad, brother, and I were playing PS2 and we all turn to see
something out the corner of our eyes. We all said it looked like a man
in white with a white ball behind him. We were kinda suspicious then. Well
nothing happened for a year I think and then something happend much worse.
My brother was on the couch and i was in my room. My mom and my brother
said they heard something knocking and scratching in that backroom with
the bullet holes in the window. My mom went back there and she opend the
door and heard it louder. It was coming from the closet. She saw that the
door knob started turning and she ran down the hall. She sat in the chair
next to my brother and then we heard someone running down the hall and
then it stoped and it was over...Its been a while since that but were waiting
on something else to happen.</B><B></B>

<P><B>My Ghost</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: mdeeb@bellsouth.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hi-</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;I have enjoyed your website and wish to share one of my experiences.
This is all true and if you have any comments about the ghost or questions,
please feel free to email me, as I'd like to know what it might have been</B>
<BR><B>-Debby&nbsp; at deblhd@yahoo.com</B>
<BR><B>When I was twelve or so, I had a strange experience.&nbsp; I was
playing with my friend in the woods near the Quabbin Aqueduct.&nbsp; This
is in Wayland, Massachusetts.&nbsp; We had taken her neighbor's police
dog on our adventure, looking for Indian artifacts.&nbsp; On a hill that
was gravelly, I found what I believed to be an arrowhead.&nbsp; After showing
it to my friend, I stuffed it into my pant's&nbsp; pocket and moved to
a new spot, with the dog.&nbsp; He began to whine towards some bushes about
twenty feet away.&nbsp; I looked in the direction the dog was looking and
saw nothing.&nbsp; Figuring it was a rabbit or squirrel, I let the dog
off his leash.&nbsp; He began barking and ran into the bushes.&nbsp; My
friend joined me and we called the dog back, he came right away, being
well trained.&nbsp; He sat, looking from us to the woods, and panting.&nbsp;
We put his leash back on and both my friend and I had the feeling of being
watched.&nbsp; I reached into my pocket to see the arrowhead, but it was
gone.&nbsp; I checked the other pocket, nothing.&nbsp; Then we decided
to go home, both of us creeped out.</B>
<BR><B>On our walk back the dog stopped at a tree and looked up.&nbsp;
We looked up, and at least thirty feet up we saw a piece of bloody fur
stuck to the tree.&nbsp; We ran back to the neighbor's and returned the
dog.&nbsp; Not wanting to get laughed at, we didn't tell him about the
fur.</B>
<BR><B>My friend got her bike and went halfway with me to my house.&nbsp;
When I got in the door the phone rang, it was my friend.&nbsp; She asked
if I was okay.&nbsp; I was fine, I told her.&nbsp; Then she explained he'd
seen someone lurking in the bushes of the only empty house in my neighborhood,
and they seemed to be following me.&nbsp; I dismissed it and ate dinner.&nbsp;
That night, a storm came, the thunder and lightning woke me up.&nbsp; During
a flash of light, I saw a tall thin figure at the foot of my bed.&nbsp;
I think it was a man.&nbsp; He wore all black, a long odd jacket, and had
very long arms, they reached his knees.&nbsp; On his head was a stovepipe
hat that was too high and had a wide brim so his face was shadowed.&nbsp;
As I looked at him, too terrified to scream, he raised his arm and pointed
at me with a long finger.&nbsp; Another flash of light and he was gone.&nbsp;
In the morning at school before homeroom, I asked my friend to describe
the person she had seen the day before in the bushes.&nbsp; She said he
was thin and had a wierd hat, like Lincoln wore.&nbsp; Of course I was
freaked out.</B>
<BR><B>I don't know how much later, maybe a month or more, I was doing
homework on my bed, and heard scuffling in my closet.&nbsp; Thinking it
was the cat, I opened the door to scoot him out.&nbsp; The cat was not
there, but the clothes were swaying side to side.&nbsp; I closed the door
and left my room.</B>
<BR><B>The next and last time I saw the ghost, was at summer camp.&nbsp;
I had been put into a room alone having had a panic attack over an incident
in which I'd had a dream come true. I'd dreamt a kid got run over by a
van, and a storm came and a cabin was hit by lightening and kids burnt
up.</B>
<BR><B>That day, we were teamed up and competing for ribbons.&nbsp; One
event was the van pull.&nbsp; A team of kids were pulling a van, a kid
fell under and the van went over him.&nbsp; He was unhurt, but the license
plate made a dirty mark on his back.&nbsp; I got scared, and then it began
raining very hard.&nbsp; Everyone headed to their cabins.&nbsp; It began
to lightening and I lost my mind.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'd confided my dream to
my friend that morning, and as she tried to tell the counselor, I was crying
and trying to warn people about the fire I believed to be about to happen.&nbsp;
The counselor locked me in her room, alone.&nbsp; A blast of thunder and
lightening hit and blew the outside door open, rain poured in, and in the
storm stood my ghost looking in at me.&nbsp; I screamed and slammed the
door shut.&nbsp; Luckily, the fire never happened.</B>
<BR><B>I never saw the ghost again.&nbsp; I often wonder about it and as
scary as it was it never hurt me.</B>

<P><B>My Feeling</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: rhiana@mac.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>Hi. I think paranormal stuff is real, but I have never actually seen
a</B>
<BR><B>ghost or heard any wierd noises, but i just have felt like something</B>
<BR><B>wasn't right in certain rooms. My dad used to be in the military,
so</B>
<BR><B>i've lived in a couple of different places, but I only really remember</B>
<BR><B>some things from the last house we lived in before this house. Sometimes</B>
<BR><B>I would wake up during the middle of the night &amp; when I was
about 5 or</B>
<BR><B>6&amp; I'd do that, I'd sometimes want to go to my parents room(which
was on</B>
<BR><B>the other side of the house)although I don't really remember why
I did</B>
<BR><B>want to. So sometimes I'd try to go to my parents bedroom. But I
never</B>
<BR><B>did succeed because I didn't like to go down without a flash light
&amp; I</B>
<BR><B>didn't have one so I always felt uncomfortable when trying to go
through</B>
<BR><B>the living room then kitchen to get to my parents bedroom because
at</B>
<BR><B>night without the lights on I felt creeped out in that area&amp;
during the</B>
<BR><B>daytime, if I were in my parents bathroom I felt creeped out too.
Those</B>
<BR><B>places just didn't feel right. And I didn't find out that my sister
&amp;</B>
<BR><B>mom felt just the same too until I was 9 or 10( a year or two ago).
I</B>
<BR><B>don't know how my dad felt about the house because I never bothered
to</B>
<BR><B>ask him. But I have reason to believe that that house is haunted
because</B>
<BR><B>also one time, my sister woke up in the middle of the night &amp;
she said</B>
<BR><B>that she saw a ghostly hand close my door. Of course, I was asleep
&amp;</B>
<BR><B>even though my sister &amp; I get really mad at each other sometimes,
I</B>
<BR><B>honestly think she wasn't lying at all.</B><B></B>

<P><B>My Experience at the Flamingo</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: WarpedRealityNYC@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had recently visited Las Vegas last
month with my mother,father, and friend.&nbsp; We stayed at the Flamingo
Hotel on the Vegas Strip.&nbsp; My friend Dave and I stayed in one room
and my parents in another, Dave and I were the only ones with keys for
this room.&nbsp; Well, we stayed for 5 days and for the first few days
, I kept hearing the faucet in the bathroom go on and off with no one in
there.&nbsp; On the last night , I had a horrible dream of me dying and
I woke up. When I awoke I saw two figures in my room. One of the figures
was a chubby man and he was standing in front of my friends bed sipping
what looked like a martini or atleat in a martini glass.&nbsp; The other
resembled a woman and she was near our luggage.&nbsp; This is def not the
first experience I have had with ghosts and I make sure I know what I am
looking at before I make a judgement.&nbsp; So, after looking at them a
minute or so, I turned away and they were still there when I turned back</B><B></B>

<P><B>My Experience</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>By: jstrak4584@rogers.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I have had a few encounters with a something, I'm not quite sure
what it was, maybe you can make sense out of it. The first time I saw this
thing was when I was still living at home with my parents. I was out partying
that evening and had had a few cocktails (well maybe more than a few) and
I came home and went to bed (passed out). Well after I had been asleep
for a while I rolled over and cocked open an eye and I think that I saw
somebody (might of been a man) standing over my bed. Now you have to understand
that I am not the most responsive person when I'm not really awake. So
I remember looking at the person and saying oh, and then I rolled over
and went back to sleep. I think that it might have come back a couple of
times. But like I said I didn't really take notice of it till the next
morning when I was fully awake, and thought did that really happen.</B>
<BR><B>Then when I got married and was pregnant with my first child, I
think that thing came back again, but just for a couple of weeks. I had
gone to bed early and I was really tired because I was still in my first
trimester. My husband was downstairs and I had just fallen asleep when
something woke me up, at first I thought it was my husband, trying to talk
to me, but it was something standing over my bed. I think that I said something
back and looked again and then there was nothing there. I had to turn on
the lights to see if there was something really there. The next weekend
the same thing happened on Friday night I had just gone to sleep and the
thing started talking to me again and woke me up, and then went away. The
next night it was like this thing was right in my face yelling and waving
hands at me, and I got mad because I was trying to sleep and I said "would
you just&nbsp; F--- off".</B>
<BR><B>Now I haven't seen anything since that episode and we have moved
a cross the country, and I haven't seen anything at our new place either,&nbsp;
they never really scared me or anything but I'm kind of happy that I haven't
seen anything in a long while, kind of gives you the heebee jeebees when
you think about it. But since we have moved I had a second son, David who
is 6 months old. When we went back home for a visit I was telling my sister
that I think that David sees ghosts, because he'll focus on nothing and
all of a sudden just start laughing and smiling, something my first son
never did. Well a half hour after I had told her that we went out to get
some Sushi, I had to run out the restaurant for a second and my sister
was holding David. The Sushi guy was saying how cute he was and then he
said, totally out of the blue, does he see angels. I thought that that
was really weird, and quite a coincidence.</B>
<BR><B>Well thank you for listening to what I think are my experiences
with a spirit. If you have any questions please feel free to contact me.</B><B></B>

<P><B>MY DAUGHTER'S BEDROOM</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: victor.pospischil@verizon.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>Thank you for the opportunity to share my "ghostly" experience.</B>
<BR><B>I have had encounters with spirits for most of my life but nothing
prepared me for my most intense encounter which occurred about ten&nbsp;
years ago with a spirit who occupies our home, most specifically my daughter's
bedroom.</B>
<BR><B>First, a little history.&nbsp; We moved into our home 16 years ago.&nbsp;
The previous occupants were a sister and brother.&nbsp; The sister passed
away in her bedroom (now my daughter Helene's room).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
When I first entered the home before purchasing it, I was struck by the
hundreds of knick-nacks in every room of the home.&nbsp; I could barely
walk through the rooms, fearful I would knock something over.&nbsp; Many
of these were plates and statues, all fine china and expensive.&nbsp; Even
more peculiar,&nbsp; the woman had placed a sticker on each item which
contained the date of purchase, the place of purchase, whether it was a
gift, and if a gift, who gave her the item.&nbsp; She obviously was devoted
to her possessions.</B>
<BR><B>I did not begin to experience anything unusual until I began redecorating
what was to be my daughter's room.&nbsp; My first encounter occurred while
painting her bedroom in 1987.&nbsp; I would often be distracted by footsteps
on the stairs, or the feeling of something brushing against me.&nbsp; At
one point, I heard the front door close and someone walking in the living
room.&nbsp; I called out my wife's name, thinking she was entering the
house.&nbsp; No answer.&nbsp; I walked downstairs calling for her.&nbsp;
When I reached the kitchen, I heard footsteps going up our stairs.&nbsp;
I walked back into the living room and heard my daughter's bedroom door
close.&nbsp; I stopped, realizing my wife was not home, walked up the stairs
to the bedroom, opened the door and as I entered the room I felt someone
brush against me.&nbsp; I realized someone was playing a joke on me and
it was not my wife.&nbsp; As I have often done in the past, I speak to
the spirits ( they don't speak back).&nbsp; I said, "Listen, I'm really
busy.&nbsp; Please leave me alone so I can finish what I have to do."&nbsp;
There were no further incidents that day.&nbsp; The room was completed.</B>
<BR><B>About three months after the bedroom was completed, I noticed the
paint was chipping and the wallpaper was beginning to peel.&nbsp; Within
a year, I had spackled and repainted twice to restore the room.&nbsp; Always
the chipping and peeling would occur.</B>
<BR><B>It is important to note that my daughter was 1 year old when we
purchased the home.&nbsp; Beginning at the age of two, my daughter would
complain that there was a woman in her room.&nbsp; I would reassure her
that it was a dream, though I knew she was indeed seeing a woman.&nbsp;&nbsp;
She would awaken in the middle of the night and there would be an elderly
woman standing by her bed watching her.&nbsp; Also she began to complain
that&nbsp; this woman would "pass through" the room, along with other spirits.&nbsp;
Finally, I acknowledged to Helene that I had encounters with this spirit
also, and I believed the stories she was relating to me.&nbsp;&nbsp; Helene
began to cover her mirror and her TV with blankets because she would see
the reflection of these spirits when she laid in bed.&nbsp; Interestingly,
Helene has never refused to sleep in the room because she says that the
woman has never done anything to make her feel threatened.</B>
<BR><B>However, I was about to have a truly frightening experience with
Helene's benevolent visitor.</B>
<BR><B>As a young child, Helene would often get out of bed and crawl in
bed with us, as most children do.&nbsp; When she was five years old, one
evening she crawled into bed with us in the middle of the night.&nbsp;
I had not gotten much sleep that night because my son Mark was sick and
I was in and out of bed to check on him.&nbsp; I had carried Helene back
to her bed twice that night and decided to leave her in our bed and sleep
in her bed.</B>
<BR><B>I entered her room and laid down on her bed facing the wall.&nbsp;
I closed my eyes and at that moment heard the bedroom door open.&nbsp;
I felt someone crawl in the bed with me.&nbsp;&nbsp; I still had my eyes
closed, and thinking it was Helene I said, "Helene, daddy needs to go to
sleep.&nbsp; You've got to settle down and go to sleep."&nbsp; No response.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I felt an arm wrap around my waist and a leg rub against my leg.&nbsp;
The person's hand was caressing my right arm and the leg was moving up
and down my leg.&nbsp; I realized it wasn't my daughter.&nbsp; Thinking
it was my wife, I said, "Terry, you've got be kidding.&nbsp; The last thing
I feel tonight is romantic."&nbsp; No response.&nbsp; At that moment, the
person's hand gripped my wrist and began lifting my arm into the air.&nbsp;
I opened my eyes, focused on the wallpaper and then realized my arm was
suspended in the air and there was nothing holding it.&nbsp; I knew at
that moment who was in bed with me.&nbsp; I tried to push away but the
hand and the leg fastened tighter and I could not pull free.&nbsp; The
force of the spirit was holding me and I was frozen.&nbsp;&nbsp; As the
spirit's caresses intensified, so did my fear.&nbsp; Searching for a way
to get away from the spirit, and in a panic, I screamed out, "In the name
of God and the Blessed Mother,&nbsp; leave me alone and leave this house!"&nbsp;
Suddenly, the spirit lifted away from me and I actually felt it move through
the room.&nbsp; I stumbled out of the bed and ran into my room.&nbsp; To
this day, I have never slept in my daughter's room.</B>
<BR><B>Since that experience we have remodeled Helene's room.&nbsp; Once
again, within a short period of time, her wallpaper began to peel and the
paint chipped from her ceiling.&nbsp; In the next few months I will be
once again remodeling her bedroom.&nbsp; We are going to re-drywall her
room in the hope that the fresh walls and ceiling will prevent the room's
self-destruction.&nbsp; Since my plea to God and the Blessed Mother, there
have been no physical contacts with the spirit.&nbsp; However, Helene will
still say the woman has been in her room and she continues to cover her
TV and her mirror each night.</B>
<BR><B>It is my belief that the woman still believes Helene's room is her
room.&nbsp; She was so meticulous with her belongings, I believe the self-destruction
of the walls and ceiling are her way of saying she is displeased with another
person occupying her space.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is interesting to note that
no other room in the house suffers from this phenomena.&nbsp; One would
think that this spirit was trying to make love to me.&nbsp; I did not sense
a sexual nature to the spirit's intentions.&nbsp; In retrospect,&nbsp;
I felt vibrations of sadness and loneliness coming from the spirit and
I believe she was searching for physical tenderness.</B><B></B>

<P><B>My Dad's Ghost</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: ptsi@rose.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>Before my Dad died he had said he had said many times he</B>
<BR><B>wanted to go to hs grave knowing his 4 girls were well taken care
of.&nbsp; He had made a will and told me all about the wills contents.&nbsp;
Years later my Dad committed suicide, it happened on a Friday and his ghost
came to me the next day. I was in my bed and at my doorway he appeared
and came to my bedside he said over and over "don't let them trick you,
they are going to trick you, don't let them." I could not figure out what
he was talking about.&nbsp; The appearance was real and there was no mistake
about what he said or what he meant, however at the time I was so sick
with grief I</B>
<BR><B>had no idea what it meant.&nbsp; A week later my mother declares
"there is no will" and insists all 4 girls sign our share of the inhertence
over to her, we of course do, however I am insisting YES there is a will
my Daddy told me and he told me what it said....To sum it up --- I investigate
for 13 years....I was right there was a will just like my Dad told me,</B>
<BR><B>he had left me a life estate on the family home and my sisiters
money equal amounts of money to the value to the family home.&nbsp; My
mother and my Aunt had decided to decieve everyone about the will so my
mother could had everything herself.&nbsp; (My Dad after he died saw them
scheming and came to me in my bedroom and told me, "they are going to trick
you") This to me is prove of what</B>
<BR><B>everyone wants to know about "what happens after we die?"</B>
<BR><B>It proves that our loved ones can oversee to some extent</B>
<BR><B>what happens to us.&nbsp; My Dad had always said he wanted to go
to his grave "knowing" his girls were taken care of, when my mother destroyed
his will she also detroyed his "rest in peace" and he came back to try
and make things the way he had intended to leave them.</B><B></B>

<P><B>My Cat</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: 2polmar@optushome.com.au</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hi my name is Rachel. i've had a few ghosts visiting
me before.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; at school we have a sports shed and 4 people
from yr 6 are in charge of it. i just wanted to get a tennis ball oneday
and found more than 4 people in the sports shed. they said to me that they
would let me in if i didn't tell anyone else about it. and because they
were playing murder in the dark, i decided to play aswell. so in the dark,
i hid behind a plastic barrel. i wanted to find something to scratch so
i could scare the person that was in. i looked around but saw nothing that
i could scratch so i looked above me. there i saw a glowing circle with
sparks coming out of it. it moved, i screamed and ran out of the sports
shed with everyone else following behind me. i never went in there again.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; when you walk up the hallway in my house you
see a room in front of you with a window showing the backyard.i was walking
up that hallway oneday and just looked out of the window. what i saw was
a black shadowy man running into the bushes.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i was just reading in my bed one night when Quillan
my cat jumped on my bed. he had just started purring when he stopped and
turned his head to the doorway. then i heard faint footsteps, like those
of cats, walking across the carpet. i guessed that it was my cat, Julliet.
she died a year ago by getting hit by a car. a day before she visited my
room that night, i prayed to God that Julliet visit me cos i hadn't seen
her for a year.</B>

<P><B>My Beautiful Ghost Story</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: md44@citlink.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;I have had so many visions and visitations in my life that
I can't remember them all. I do know that I tried to tell my mother of
these things so many times when I was young that I finally stopped talking
about them because as I was told by her "people who see and hear things
are called witches and you know what happened to them? They were burnt!"
Needless to say, I still have a fear of fire..... .Most sightings were
just curious and didn't scare me. In fact I believe my guardian angel showed
himself to me many times in my troubled childhood and again only about
10 years ago. I have been saved many times, I have had "someone" help me
save my daughter and once when my daughter was sliding down a mountain
something held her up in mid air and set her down on firm ground while
her husband, a friend and my niece were watching....... None of this has
to do with my story I just wanted to make the point that my life has always
had ghosts in it. I have had several frightening brushes and a couple darn
right scary face to face happenings but this is my beautiful ghost story.......</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;I was divorced and in my 30's, still partying but finding
it less and less fulfilling. I had recently broken up with my boyfriend
and had gone out to have a couple of drinks and listen to music. This guy
kept hitting on me, I told him nicely that I wasn't interested but he kept
it up until I was almost mean about it. I was not attracted to him at all
but as the blues music and the couple of drinks added to my sadness, I
left with him at closing time. I know this sounds trashy but this is how
it happened and this is how I have to tell it... I was kind of surprised
at myself but I had this draw to go with him. I followed him to his house
and could have turned away at any time and that's what I wanted to do but
there was this pull. So I went and shortly after we were in bed, "making
love", it was terrible and clumsy and made me wonder again...Why?&nbsp;
We went to sleep. I don't know how long after we fell asleep, that I started
to wake with an old but familiar feeling and it unnerved me because when
I see things other people can't it always starts with this "feeling" almost
like a vibration between seeing and hearing. I open my eyes and I can see
two old people coming down the hall, they're floating down the hall and
coming toward the bedroom. The women is wearing a long white night gown
that buttons up to the neck, with long sleeves and her hair is in a bun
on her head. the man is wearing a long white night shirt and a cap on his
head, the kind you see in cartoons. They were very pleasant looking, in
fact happy. As they came close to the door of the bedroom I had to close
my eyes even thought I wanted to look at them. I don't understand why but
sometimes in a situation with sprits you, well I, am unable to move and
you just go with the flow so to speak.. So my eyes are closed but I feel
them come into the room, I felt them sit on my side of the bed and than
lay down. Now as I said I have had experiences with spirits all my life
but having one in bed with you is strange to say the least. Than they rolled
over, into our bodies. I know this sounds too unbelievable too be true,
if it didn't happen to me I wouldn't believe it either. As soon as it happened
I opened my eyes and so did the man I was with, we made love as if we were
in love. As I said I had been married before so I thought I knew what making
love to someone really meant but this was truly the best feeling I have
ever had and I'm not talking smut, I mean I felt truly in love and loved.
His touch made my heart melt, his caress made me feel like I was the center
of his world, I fell asleep in his arms and wrapped in love. This happened
two more times. The second time they came down the hall they were dressed
the same except he didn't have the cap on and her hair was not braided
and hanging down on her left shoulder. The third time her hair was in a
braid and laying over her left shoulder and each time I had to close my
eyes and felt them come into the room over on to my side of the bed ( which
was against the wall) sit down and roll over into us. In the morning we
were talking before I left and he seemed unaware of anything "strange"
happening so I finally came out and asked him who were the two old people
that kept coming in here. He looked totally shocked and said "You see them
too!!!" I thought that meant he had seen them but it turned out that his
ex-girlfriend kept seeing them,freaked and had moved out. He than told
me this was his grandparents house and in fact their bed. I did ask about
the bed being moved and my side had been the open side of the bed. I had
no desire to see him again and never went back but I have never forgotten
the feeling of being so in love and only wish I could find it with a "real"
person :)&nbsp; I know this sounds crazy. I've been reading other peoples
experiences with spirits and&nbsp; rarely read of an encounter of a pleasant
kind and just wanted to share.</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Message From the Other Side</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: X89C6@cs.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>This incident is not about a haunting, and the story makes me feel
very good</B>
<BR><B>when I think about it. It concerns the passing of a family member,
and what I</B>
<BR><B>believe is a message from the other side...through television!</B>
<BR><B>My dearest uncle, R.O. Simpson passed away at the University of
Cincinnati</B>
<BR><B>Medical Center while in the middle of open heart surgery. Uncle
Ray was an</B>
<BR><B>avid hunter who raised Walker treeing hounds commonly used for raccoon</B>
<BR><B>hunting. This was Uncle Ray's favorite sport. He was no longer able
to follow</B>
<BR><B>his hounds, so while they ran and bayed on the trail he would sit
on the hill</B>
<BR><B>and just listen. When he was finished he would use his hunters horn
and call</B>
<BR><B>his dogs back in.</B>
<BR><B>The last thing my Uncle told me was that he would talk to after
the operation</B>
<BR><B>"one way or the other" as he put it. Unfortunately, as I mentioned
he did not</B>
<BR><B>survive the operation. He was buried in our family plot and his
headstone is</B>
<BR><B>adorned with the silhouette of a hound raised up on the trunk of
a tree, with</B>
<BR><B>harvest moon in the background.</B>
<BR><B>Life went back to normal for the family except for me. I was very
close to my</B>
<BR><B>uncle and was very depressed by his passing. One day, while walking
on the</B>
<BR><B>hill behind our farm, I spoke to my uncle. I reminded him that he
said that</B>
<BR><B>he would talk to me after his surgery...on way or the other. I told
him that</B>
<BR><B>I hoped that he was in "coon hunter heaven" and that if he were...let
me know.</B>
<BR><B>Of course, the only answer I received was the sound of the wind
in the oak</B>
<BR><B>and hickory trees on the crest of the ridge. I laughed at my silly
one sided</B>
<BR><B>conversation and went back home.</B>
<BR><B>That evening, I was unable to fall asleep...which is uncharacteristic
for</B>
<BR><B>me...I usually am snoring when I hit the pillow. After a couple
of hours, I</B>
<BR><B>gave up and went out to the living room and turned on the television.
I was</B>
<BR><B>surfing through the channels when I came across and old episode
of the</B>
<BR><B>Twilight Zone. Imagine the shock I received when the episode turned
out to be</B>
<BR><B>the tale of an old Ozark coon hunter...who's name in the story was
Hadly</B>
<BR><B>Simpson!</B>
<BR><B>In the story, Hadly Simpson, (played by character actor Arthur Hunnicut)
and</B>
<BR><B>his hound dog were killed while on a coon hunt! The story line was
about the</B>
<BR><B>old hunters dealing with his own death, and the attempts of the
devil to</B>
<BR><B>trick him into Hades. Eventually, due to the loyalty to his hound
dog who was</B>
<BR><B>not allowed into the nether regions, the old hunter declined the
invitation</B>
<BR><B>of Lucifer and continued down the road until he finally arrived
in</B>
<BR><B>heaven...where the dog was welcome and where they had a "coon hunt"
every</B>
<BR><B>night! I was completely stunned. I woke my wife who came out and
watched the</B>
<BR><B>show in tears.</B>
<BR><B>Though it might have been a coincidence...I am convinced that this
incident</B>
<BR><B>was a a message from my uncle...who let me know that he was indeed
in "coon</B>
<BR><B>hunter heaven" What do you think?</B>

<P><B>Here is one that will make you wonder.&nbsp; While in Saudi Arabia
during the time of Desert Storm my husband and father in law had a mind
blowing experience.&nbsp; The day the ground war broke out&nbsp; my father
in law was sleeping and had not talked to my husband for about 5-10 days.&nbsp;
Bill(fin) woke out of a sound sleep and swears that he saw my husband standing
at the end of his bed and he told him "Don't worry dad its not your fault
that I died."&nbsp; Needless to say Bill was extremely worried and did
not sleep for 4 days until my husband called to say that he was fine.&nbsp;
The thing that makes me wonder is the fact that my father in law could
tell my husband that he had gotten new medals and where they were placed
on his uniform.&nbsp; It really makes you wonder if there is such a thing
as ghosts and ones that are still living.&nbsp; Please contact me at my

<P><B>My husband and I were on the second floor having drinks with some
close friends, when I looked over to the far wall at the stairs., just
then a tall black man appeared dressed in old torn clothes.He just vanished.
Later that night on our way back up the narrow stairs I got this feeling
that somebody was right behind me . There was no one there.Since then I
have heard that there were slaves sold in the building years ago. I don't
know how much truth there is in that but I am sure of what I saw and the
feeling that I had all night. I can't wait to go back.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>The Abandoned House</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Ladydemonologist@aol.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>On a very warm, humid summer night, so typical of Florida, I joined
three other people to attempt to catch up with a group of paranormal investigators,
who were having an overnight camp out. I did not know this other group,
but Josh had corresponded with them, and we had our own equipment. At,
the time, I had been a member of Nightwolf Paranormal Research for about
one year. We were a grass group, who shared a common interest in the paranormal.
We had changed members so many times in such a short time, but the core
group was still together.</B>
<BR><B>On this night it was two males who were original members, a new
female member, and myself. We traveled a great distance, and it was really
late and really dark where we ended up. This town was so tiny, that they
closed the gas stations, and stores at 11:00 p.m. on a Saturday night.
We found ourselves on streets so tiny that, the streets were named after
the family who lived on the trailer at the end of it. (I saw a trailer
with a satellite disk, and an outhouse. I swear this). Anyway, we could
not find this other group.</B>
<BR><B>It turns out later; we were within a few miles of them (the other
group) the whole time. But we found this little lane, that took a bend,
and wouldn’t you know it, right at the corner where the lane bent there
was an old apparently abandoned house. It was a two story, which was common
in older houses, as heat rises, and back in the days before Florida had
air conditioning, you had to have that second story, to find some relief.
Also, since we were in what appeared to be farming country, I imagine they
had larger families. On the property proper, next to the big house, was
a smaller, single-family type house. Further back was a very large equipment
shed for larger farming tools.</B>
<BR><B>Now, Josh noted the name of the lane we were on. I will explain
later why that is an important detail. Aside from the above-described buildings,
the only other building (s), was a trailer approximately a quarter of a
mile up the lane, on the property. We were delighted at this turn of events,
and decided to take a walk about, and maybe do a little filming.</B>
<BR><B>Since we had already planned on joining another crew, we had our
night scope, our video camera, our digital camera, and our EMF detector.
(EMF measures electromagnetic fields; a common tool when you suspect spiritual
energy may be present.) We knew we had to be extra careful, because usually
we would check out a property during the day, so we could look for any
and all possible dangers. (Barbwire, broken tombstones, holes to twist
ankles, plus, more important, we did not have permission to enter the property,
and we do not trespass.</B>
<BR><B>But we did decide to do some filming, plus I wanted to see if I
could pick anything up. I am our group’s “spotter”. Specifically what that
means is I am psychic, and very sensitive to spirits. Some of the most
dramatic pictures we have ever taken were taken when I felt a presence,
and later the spirit appeared on film.</B>
<BR><B>We soon realized we were in for a lot more than we planned on such
short notice. Almost as soon as we exited the vehicle, and started to distribute
the gear to everyone, we heard a growl. Well, of course there are feral
dogs everywhere, not to mention foxes, possums, and who-knows-what-else
running around. Now we were careful to examine our surroundings, and we
noticed that even though it was dark, there was something, and I do mean
a SOMETHING, that was darker than the background. We have seen these before,
usually in cemeteries. They look like little black tornados, and they are
definitely inhuman, and definitely do not ever have our best interest at
heart. In fact they really seem to draw energy from our equipment, and
even ourselves, hence the “cold spots” people experience. Well, we filmed
“it”, and also took snap shots with both “B’s” camera, as well as our digital
camera. It was at that point, we realized a spirit not only had gotten
between the car and ourselves, (the car was eloped with a black cloud),
but something was behind us too. I started to follow my feelings, and I
started to wander up the lane alone, toward the shadow, when Josh’s voice
came through my headset telling me to come back. I turned around, started
to walk back to the they, when “K”, suddenly said “______, come here quick!”.
I asked “Where is it..?”, and as soon as I asked, I knew. K saw, actually
saw, a green luminous hand appear, and pull my ponytail. It shook me. Of
all the things I have ever seen, and experienced, this was a very evil
spirit. And, K, who is a man, found himself under some sort of oppression,
started crying. I cannot express how shocking that was. He was simply overwhelmed
by something. We all began to smell a strong odor of baby power. Now, at
this time I will mention, we female members of the crew, do not wear make-up,
hair spray, or perfume during an investigation. Sometimes, spirits make
themselves know by bringing about odors, to announce their presence.</B>
<BR><B>We looked to see if there were wild flowers, orange blossoms, or
anything that could have possibly explain what we were smelling. No, this
was definitely baby powder.</B>
<BR><B>K also was scanning the property, and filming with the video camera,
and he called me over to look over his shoulder while he filmed. (He didn’t
want to move the camera.) There was two forms, a taller one, and a shorter
one DIRECTLY in front video camera, invisible to the naked eye, but the
camera was seeing it! The two forms were not the same as the black tornado
like creatures.</B>
<BR><B>After what seemed a relatively short period of time, we went back
into the car, and discovered hours had passed! We had lost all concept
of time. But the story would not end there.</B>
<BR><B>We arrived at our respective homes after the sun had risen, and
Josh dropped me off, and I decided a nap was definitely called for. I fell
into a very troubled sleep, and had a very vivid dream about the house,
and what had happened there.</B>
<BR><B>The dream was disturbing, and there were details I will not discuss
at this time, but the most awful part, was I suddenly awoke vomiting, and
losing control of my bowels. Now, I had not been sick. Nor, had I been
exposed to the flu, or anything else. The dream preceded the sudden onset
of my being sick.</B>
<BR><B>When Josh came over later to check on me, I told him how sick I
was. But there was more. I needed to take a bath after my onset on sickness,
and there was a bruised bite mark on my upper arm! Purple, and black, you
could actually see teeth marks! In fact, I showed the mark to a neighbor
a day or two later, and she said it looked like someone had bitten me,
because you could see teeth marks. Needless to say, no one had bitten me.
No one we could see. But whatever spirit had pulled my hair, didn’t seem
to have a problem leaving any other marks.</B>
<BR><B>But, that was not the end of this particular story. I had a second,
equally vivid dream, once again about the history of this house, and the
crime that was committed there. And more importantly, by whom. It explained
the larger and smaller spirits seen in the video camera, and the odor of
baby powder. It also explained the shadows we saw running by the smaller
house.</B>
<BR><B>I have had spirits attempt to communicate with me before. It seems
that once spirits figure out your are sensitive to their presence, they
really do want to communicate. I would even offer that perhaps the reason
spirits get frustrated, and make things “happen”, is because they are trying
to communicate, and frankly, no one likes to be ignored. I will also offer
at this time, that if someone is a wonderful person in this life, that
chances are pretty good, they will be wonderful on the “other” side of
the veil that separates us, from our deceased. But, on the other hand,
if someone is nasty, and not a nice person, well, death is not the cure-all,
to suddenly turn them into really nice people. That only makes sense, after
all.</B>
<BR><B>Never before had I dreamed about an investigation and never before,
had I become so violently ill for no apparent reason. The dreams were not
the same. They were an explanation of the history of the house as told
by two different people who knew it’s intimate history.</B>
<BR><B>Now, I explained previously, that this was a very tiny town. And
the name of the former inhabitants of the house had come to me twice in
two different dreams. So, I decided to check information for a listing
on THAT last name on THAT lane. (Remember, the only other building, and
the only one that showed any sign of life, was the trailer up the road).
My reasoning was, that if the property had stayed in the family, that family
would probably have purchased the trailer, instead on taking care of the
cost of that huge, old farmhouse. Also, after the dream I had witnessed,
I imagine after the violence I believed I saw, the family would not have
wanted to live there anyway.</B>
<BR><B>I called information, and asked for a listing for R________ Smith,
on F______ Road. The operator checked, and said, “ Oh, I don’t have a R______
Smith on F_____ Road, but I do have an initial R. Smith on that road..”.
I thanked her.</B>
<BR><B>Only one other residence on that tiny Lane. The trailer. The telephone
listing with the last name, and the first initial of the man I dreamed
about, and the crime I witnessed in my dreams.</B>
<BR><B>The same R_____ Smith, who used a ghostly hand to pull my hair,
and bite my arm. The same R____ Smith who made a grown man, K, cry.</B>
<BR><B>When the pictures from the cameras were developed, NONE of the pictures
turned out. That in itself, and of itself is odd. But watching the videotape,
we saw a pair of glowing red eyes, and unmistakably you can hear a voice
say “ help me”, in a weak female voice.</B>
<BR><B>The night before I began this book, I was relating the story about
the house to two members of Nightwolf Paranormal Research who had been
unable to join us on that particular night. The two members, Suzy, and
Joe, are a dating couple, and very close to each other. The layout of my
house is such that we have added on a back room, a Florida room, where
there had once been a sliding glass door going out to a screened in porch.
The porch has been enclosed, and now has my dining room table and the Christmas
tree out there.</B>
<BR><B>Lying on the dining room table, was Suzy’s purse, and cell phone.
I was seated across the table, and at the opposite side from both the purse,
and the cell phone.</B>
<BR><B>Suzy was seated just inside the main part of the house, seated next
to Joe. I told them the story I have just related to you, when Joe’s cell
phone, in his pocket, and on vibrate, went off. By the time he, Joe pulled
it out of his pocket, it had stopped its silent ring, and when he checked
the caller-ID, it was Suzy’s cell phone, that had dialed Joe’s cell phone,
while in full view of all of us, WHILE NO ONE WAS NEAR IT! Talk about a
strange thing to have happen. But we have all had strange things happen
since our forays into the paranormal. We were not frightened, simply amazed.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>My Friends Moms Story</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: pknowles15@comcast.net</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;This story was told to me bye a friends mother.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I heard it about 5 days
ago. we were looking at this sight when we started talking about our own
experiences. She told us that when she was a little girl her and a friend
would play barbies down stairs in her parents basement. But this story
goes back before that even there used to be a slow scratching on the cement
floor of the basement, and after a while it stopped scaring people because
they were just like getting used to it or something. And this went on for
years. Well ok, her and a friend were playing barbies down stairs and they
heard the "dreaded sound" and she yelled at it to leave them alone because
they were just playing barbies and they weren't doing any thing to it.
well after a while they put the barbies to bed and went outside to play.</B>
<BR><B>The next day they went down stairs to play. when they got to the
barbie house the first weird thing was that her friends doll was out of
his bed in the living room. And when she went to pick it up it fell into
3 pieces,like the thing broke it but then partly put it back together.
they think it did that because she yelled at it and it got mad at them
or something.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; And if you think it was a little kids imagination, you would
be wrong because she&nbsp; heard it again when she was about 14 or 15.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hay May</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Histrybuff23@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp; To begin I must tell you all of my life I've been followed
, plagued ,whatever by these spirits. And ususally I can tell when their
back cause they always mess with me first. This time they didn't.</B>
<BR><B>When I was 13 years old&nbsp; my mother kept complaining of nightmares.
She said it sounded like a million voices were whispering in her ear at
this she woluld wake up.Sometimes this would happen several times a night.
When my friend jumped out of bed and&nbsp; said she heard chattering voices
in her ear I thought she was making it up or perhaps the power of suggestion
from my mother telling us about herself.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Than one night I was sleeping on the floor next to
my bed cause I was more comfortable there. As I was dreaming I kept hearing
someone's whispering in my ear I kept telling him to go away he would and
than he'd be back leaning on my shoulder like begging for money or something.He
or so I thought was annoying me in my dream. Finally it kept whispering
in my ear and leaning on my shoulder. I woke up .With a choking pressure
on my neck {I was on my side luckily} and whispering of a&nbsp; thousand
demonic voices in my ear saying "Hay May. Hay May. Hay May." My eyes were
open I knew I was awake I could see my teddy bear.I was paralyzed . I tryed
to scream all I got was a slight beginning of&nbsp; clearing my throat.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which this experience leaves me asking. Who is
May?</B><B></B>

<P><B>Haunted Life</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: INaNnA41@aol.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>I have been visiting your website for over six years, it is by far
the best</B>
<BR><B>site on the internet. I am finally going to write my story, since
my</B>
<BR><B>experience last night left me with no sleep and I had to call in
to work.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I Have lived in the western suburbs of
Chicago for all of my life save 2</B>
<BR><B>years years in California. I am 21 Years old. My experiences that
I can</B>
<BR><B>remember started when I was four years old our dog that died used
to run</B>
<BR><B>under my bed every night after my Mom tucked me in. I would call
my Mom back</B>
<BR><B>and ask her why the dog ran under my bed, I didn't really understand
what</B>
<BR><B>death was back then, and I just figured the dog wanted to hide under
my bed.</B>
<BR><B>The next very scary thing that used to happen to me frequently from
about the</B>
<BR><B>age of four to the age of six, was a yellow light (just like a light
bulb) or</B>
<BR><B>orb used to appear to me at night usually on the door of my room
or on the</B>
<BR><B>wall opposite my bed, the orb had a female voice that used to say
my name and</B>
<BR><B>i would be terrified, I always felt that she was the devil and very
evil,</B>
<BR><B>when I would gather up the courage to run out of my room she would
laugh and</B>
<BR><B>say that I couldn't hide from her. I would usually end up sleeping
on the</B>
<BR><B>floor in my parents room down the hall. I have read many stories
and done</B>
<BR><B>research to try and understand what this talking orb was, I have
never really</B>
<BR><B>found anything like it. So if you know what it is or have had a
similar</B>
<BR><B>experience please email me and relate! I live in the same house
now, but I</B>
<BR><B>have the room that used to be my parents and my brother, the skeptic
has that</B>
<BR><B>room. Yet even he at a weak moment reported seeing a women's head
floating</B>
<BR><B>above his head when he awoke on several occasions, and having dreams
about</B>
<BR><B>the woman. Since then I have seen the ghost of a young girl float
in through</B>
<BR><B>my window, a man in my basement, a robed religious figure, and a
black haired</B>
<BR><B>woman who used to wake me up in the morning. For a couple years
I used to</B>
<BR><B>wake at 2 am to hear the front door slam and hear footsteps, oddly
enough my</B>
<BR><B>mother who sleeps in the front of the house has found the front
door open.</B>
<BR><B>For one summer What I thought was my Mom walking through the upstairs
hall at</B>
<BR><B>about midnight every night to check on us upstairs (the steps made
that flip</B>
<BR><B>flop noise like slippers do) I thought nothing of it, one day I
questioned</B>
<BR><B>her about it and she said she never walked the hallway. Although
I don't have</B>
<BR><B>it as much anymore I used to have precognition nearly every night
in my</B>
<BR><B>dreams, It was usually of stupid things, I would dream of a person
I didn't</B>
<BR><B>know and the next day they would walk by me. It was always simple
unimportant</B>
<BR><B>things. Nowadays I rarely have those dreams, or maybe I just don't
remember</B>
<BR><B>them. Most of these strange happenings ceased by the time I was
17. I am 21</B>
<BR><B>now and the strange seems to have come back from vacation. 3 weeks
ago my dad</B>
<BR><B>and brother were out of town and it was just my Mom my sister and
I. One</B>
<BR><B>night we were coming home early evening, we arrived home (let me
make note</B>
<BR><B>that our house is an old farmhouse built in the 1880s, and the garage
is not</B>
<BR><B>attached to the house) i walked up to the front door I didn't have
any keys</B>
<BR><B>so I waited for my Mom and sis. We have 2 big dogs and I could see
them</B>
<BR><B>waiting inside the double doors for us. Next to the porch is window
that is</B>
<BR><B>above large thorny bushes. I was still on the porch alone when suddenly
there</B>
<BR><B>was a big crash the side of the house shook and there was a shattering
of</B>
<BR><B>glass. my first instinct was that an animal had fallen from the
roof because</B>
<BR><B>the house shook and the bushes outside the window. We entered the
house and</B>
<BR><B>discover the window has shattered and fallen to the ground. Maybe
the dogs</B>
<BR><B>had done it, but I had seen them through the windows by the door
waiting. We</B>
<BR><B>went through every explanation there was none. The storm window
was still</B>
<BR><B>down and it was unharmed the impact had come from inside. The latest
episode</B>
<BR><B>happened last night. As I was coming out of Rem sleep a streaming
wind hit my</B>
<BR><B>body accompanied by an aaahhhh sound (not human). I opened my eyes
it</B>
<BR><B>continued there was nothing there just my dark room. It must have
lasted</B>
<BR><B>about a minute, when it was over I was freaked but I rationalized
it and told</B>
<BR><B>my self I must have still been dreaming (I don't think it was sleep
paralysis</B>
<BR><B>I could move). I rolled over on my side, a chill went up my spine
(now I have</B>
<BR><B>had chills go up my spine but never like this) I felt something
rub against</B>
<BR><B>my back and then there were little footsteps running over my body
and the</B>
<BR><B>side of my bed. Ah it was my kitty, but then it occurred to me that
my door</B>
<BR><B>was shut and locked and my kitty was not with me. The little footsteps</B>
<BR><B>continued, I finally got up the courage to say GET OUT OF MY HOUSE,
then I</B>
<BR><B>jumped out of bed and switched on the lights. I hit the couch for
a while</B>
<BR><B>then returned to my room accompanied by all three of my cats who
slept with</B>
<BR><B>me. Yet as I was drifting to sleep again, with the lights on I though
I saw</B>
<BR><B>my cat who is black next to my face then I felt fingers scratch
the other</B>
<BR><B>side of my head. Yet when I looked around me my black cat was curled
up at my</B>
<BR><B>feet. Oddly enough about 2 weeks ago I had a similar experience
I was</B>
<BR><B>drifting to sleep and I felt my cat pitpatting on my lap, when I
opened my</B>
<BR><B>eyes there was no cat and my cat was not in my room. Now when I
think back my</B>
<BR><B>Mom told me when I was little (in this house) that I would refuse
to sleep in</B>
<BR><B>my crib because a cat would bother me and it would meow at night.
Let me make</B>
<BR><B>note that I have never had a pet of mine die. The last thing I will
add is</B>
<BR><B>that in the last few months my sister has told me that she hears
me talking</B>
<BR><B>in my sleep, and I have never been a talker, sometimes I wake up
still</B>
<BR><B>talking or feeling exhausted from talking. I realize I have always
been a bit</B>
<BR><B>psychic, but I thought it had faded away. I don't know if I am going
crazy or</B>
<BR><B>what, I have never had anything touch me before and I don't like
it, if it</B>
<BR><B>happens again I am going to keep telling it to get out. At first
this scares</B>
<BR><B>me but then it makes me angry. If anyone has any similar experiences
or</B>
<BR><B>suggestions please email me. Thanks.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Ghost Stories</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: courts68@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hi Sam here, I have apparently spoke to a ghost when I was 2yrs old.
To cut a long story short, I moved to Invicta Rd in Sheerness Kent when
I was 2yrs old, with my dad, a year or so before we moved in a lonely pregnant
woman lived there and commited suicide by hanging herself , because of
the pregnancy, in the back bedroom, no one lived there till my dad and
I. I slept in the back bedroom, my dad told me that he would often hear
me talking to someone at nights in my room, my dad asked me who I was taking
to, I said it was the grey lady who sits at the end of my bed. My dad then
met my stepmum and she moved in with us. At nights sometimes my stepmum
and I would sit alone&nbsp; and she'd hear walking around upstairs and
things being moved about. It was so bad one night that she went over to
her parents house to get them, they bought over their dog, the dog started
growling and barking for no reason. My dad moved me out of the back bedroom
to another bedroom when I started to get upset and not sleepines, dreams
and anxiety are my main feelings I get. I can't walk through a graveyard
without getting anxiety and I also smell a really musty smell that no one
else seems to notice, it's so intoxicating that it makes me feel like I'm
suffacating and it makes me feel sick. Sometimes it makes me wonder whether
I still have this woman following me.</B>

<P><B>Ghost Warning</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: temblett.family@xtra.co.nz</B><B></B>

<P><B>I am a 49 yr. old man who had an experience 35 yrs ago. My sister
and myself went down to hold no 9? at the Victoria B.C. Canada golf course.
There was a story that&nbsp; a woman threw</B>
<BR><B>herself if a cliff into the sea, because her husband was cheating
on her. Anyways there was a bell on the 9th hold that your rang to "PLAY
THRU". Well about 150 students from school all went down there to see if
we could MATILDA which was the woman's name back in 1850 who killed herself.
My sister unfortunately had a broken keg and was in a cast as we all went
down to the beach calling out Matilda's name while people rang the bell.
A few moments later a mist came out of nowhere and chased 100 young teenagers
up the slope from the 9th hole by the cliff up to there cars. I will never
forget the mist descending upon myself and my sister as I tried to run
while she was in crutches. Her and I have spoken about it over the years
and we are both convinced that a ghost warned us off that evening back
in 1968.</B>

<P><B>Ghost Story</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:rkmoss@iowaone.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>I always wondered if the spirit world really could 'break through',
and now I've finally had an experience where I have no doubt that it happens.&nbsp;
I was living with my brother in his older rental house where I slept on
his couch in the living room.&nbsp; This night was typical.&nbsp; I wasn't
drinking, and I had to be at work in the morning.&nbsp; I lay down to sleep
this particular night, and his cat jumped onto my lap as usual for the
night.&nbsp; As I began to drift off, I was awakened by a strange creeking
noise in the attic above me, which wasn't anything more than unused space.&nbsp;
Then I was taken completely out of sleep by music I couldn't identify.&nbsp;
This music was a tune I couldn't even hum, and I am a singer.&nbsp; It
was clear, but I couldn't make it out.&nbsp; All I thought at the time
was,&nbsp; "Turn that crap off whoever you are!&nbsp; I'm trying to sleep,
" thinking it was a rude neighbor. It continued for what I thought were
minutes, and then I began to hear a voice speaking in the corner of the
room, clear as a bell, but I couldn't distinguish a language.&nbsp; Muffled
and clear at the same time, if that makes any sense.&nbsp; I,of course,
thought I was dreaming till I shook my head and felt the cat sit straight
up and stare into the same corner.&nbsp; I looked with her and saw a faint
'tell-tale' whitish cloudy light in the corner, and the sound it made got
louder and louder,&nbsp; then soft again,&nbsp; then louder, then softer.&nbsp;
I was ticked off, because I thought my brother was watching a movie in
his room, so I got up to look and saw he was sound asleep, and the tv was
off.&nbsp; I was shocked!&nbsp; I went back to the couch, and observed
for about another few minutes, until it was quiet again, and I no longer
saw the whitish haze.&nbsp; To my surprise, I was remarkably calm while
watching.&nbsp; I was even able to fall back to sleep.&nbsp; The next morning
I told my brother all about it, and he, being open minded as I, agreed
to tape record the following evening with a voice activated mini cassette
player.&nbsp; We couldn't believe the sounds we recorded.&nbsp; And they
had to be loud enough to activate the recorder.&nbsp; The sounds are like
that of an Indian battlefield with horses running.&nbsp; It starts out
soft, then gets louder.&nbsp; About 4 seconds worth.&nbsp; We then heard
some gutteral voice saying something that sounded Latin.&nbsp; FREAKY!!&nbsp;
We're both Christians, so we prayed for the demons/spirits to leave that
house in the name of Jesus Christ, and we never heard from them after that.&nbsp;
True Story.&nbsp; We still have the tape.</B>
<BR><B>I had recently submitted a long chapter of my life's haunting's.
Unfortunately I had forgotten one of the most significant and current sightings.</B>
<BR><B>Last year in Somerset, MA at a local gas station I had pulled in
to get gas.&nbsp; It was a Monday and it was very snowy outside.&nbsp;
I pulled in around 8:30 (because I had to be to work by 9) to see a familiar
face of an elder man, I smiled and he said what can I do for you?&nbsp;
I asked him to put ten dollars in.&nbsp; He obliged and seemed overly happy
that morning.&nbsp; When I went to pay him I had forgotten my wallet at
home and was going to be late for work.&nbsp; I asked him if I could return
the following day to pay him.&nbsp; He said that that was fine.</B>
<BR><B>The next day, later on that evening, which was a Tuesday I had completely
forgotten to stop in and pay him.&nbsp; So I figured first thing Wednesday
morning.</B>
<BR><B>Wednesday morning came and I drove down to the station to bring
the money.&nbsp; I pulled in and did not see the elder gentleman. I got
out of the car and asked where he was.&nbsp; The gas attendant told me
that unfortunately the elder man had passed away on Monday..&nbsp; I said
“well I am here to pay a bill that I owed him from Monday”.&nbsp; They
brought me into the stations office to get the bill.&nbsp; I asked them
of when did he pass away?&nbsp; They said you could not have been here
Monday morning because he passed away around 8am of a massive heart attack.&nbsp;
I said there is no way! He pumped my gas, I know it was 8:30 because I
was at work by 9. They looked at the slip and it did not have the date
on it. They assumed that I had my days confused. I insisted that how would
Mon-Wed get confused?</B>
<BR><B>They passed it off. I believe that I saw this man in a surrounding
that he had always been comfortable with and it was his last car to be
pumped.</B><B></B>

open hands, smiling the hugest smile, and backed up on the door. i wanst
afraid. without taking my eyes off the clown, i called my friends to see
it. they looked it too, one off them screamed! i got startled and looked

<BR><B>My Grandmas' Rental House</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: zshazsha</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>My grandma had a house she rented out. I moved in it for awhile and
had many strange experiences. One night I came home with my dog and as
soon as I opened the door my dog took off barking like crazy towards the
bedroom closet. This really surprised me because my dog hardly ever barked
and wasn't much of a watch dog. She stood right in front of the closet
and barked wildly for a long time. I was afraid that somebody was in that
closet but I opened the door and saw nothing. My dog continued to bark
at it and all of a sudden there was this awful smell that filled the room...like
rotting meat. The phone rang real late in the evening that night when I
answered it nobody said anything for awhile but I could hear alot of static,
like the connection wasn't very good. Finally in a very slow, deep voice
that had a kind of echo to it, someone said, "Help me, please help me."
The voice sounded like my Grandpa who had been dead a few years. I actually
asked,"Grandpa is that you?' But the voice only kept saying,"help me" until
the connection seemed to fade away. Another night my son was sleeping with
me, he was about 4yrs. old. He woke me up in the middle of the night gently
shaking me &amp; whispering to me to please wake up because there was something
standing at the side of the bed staring at him with big red eyes. I was
facing the side of the bed where he said it was and my son was on the other
side of me to my back. While he kept trying to wake me up... I heard him
but I was trying to get the courage to open my eyes. If I opened my eyes
&amp; something was there I was gonna see it &amp; I was afraid. Finally
I opened my eyes but I didn't see anything and about that same time my
son said that it was gone. He couldn't see me, he didn't know that I had
just opened my eyes. I will always wonder what I would have seen. Another
evening I was cleaning up the kitchen after supper. I had just cleared
the dishes &amp; sat all the chairs around the table. I had my back to
the table as I was washing dishes at the sink, suddenly I heard a chair
scoot loudly across the floor. I turned immediatly around to see nobody
there and a chair sitting in the middle of the floor facing me as if someone
was sitting in it looking right at me! I've had alot of strange things
happen to me in my life but that was the creepiest feeling I've ever had.
Lots of things happened in that house. My kids 6 &amp; 4 were scared to
death one day because they said thier little rocking chair started rocking
real fast all by itself. My 6 yr. old used to say she saw scarecrows looking
in the windows all the time. She is 24 now and hates scarecrows to this
day. A few times I saw a dark outline of a big man at the end of my bed
at night. There was always unexplainable noises and things going on. The
house just gave you an eerie feeling, even during the day. After I moved
out my Grandma told me that a long time ago a lady killed her husband in
that house...right by the bedroom closet!!! After my Grandma died my parents
inherited the house. My Dad told me never to say anything about what happened
to me in that house 'cause if word got around they'd never be able to rent
it. A few close friends know, but that's it. Well my parents rented it
out to this newlywed couple. I didn't know them when they first moved in
it but I ended up getting a job where the husband worked and knew him casually.
After they lived there for maybe 3 months they told my Dad they were moving
out immediatly and wouldn't tell him why. My Dad was a little mad about
it (and i was curious myself, for obvious reasons), so I mentioned it to
the husband at work. I asked him why they were moving out so suddenly.
He said he didn't have a choice because his wife had already left and said
she was never stepping foot in that house again. He didn't want to tell
me anything, he just said there were strange things going on in that house
that scared his wife. When I pressed for details, i could tell he was embarressed
to say much more, but he did say it was things like the t.v. coming on
and going off by itself,noises and stuff moving around.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Experiences</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: thomas.h.chase@verizon.net</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>I first want to say I enjoy your site a lot. I found it today and
have been reading as much of the material as I could in two sittings. I
was drawn to the sight by the article about the Defeo book. Having read
the personal experiences I thought I could be comfortable about asking
a few questions and sharing a few 'experiences' myself.</B>
<BR><B>I have been brought up like most people in society to believe these
are all just tales and that ghosts do not really exist. However, some things
in life are too unexplainable to pass off as coincidence or explainable.
My first question is can people have more than one kind of experience with
different ghosts in their lifetime? I am not asking in regard to someone
who goes looking for them like a paranormal, I mean in everyday life can
certain people be more sensitive to them than others and actually experience
occurrences many times in their lives?</B>
<BR><B>Okay I will now explain... It would seem in my life there have been
many strange things that have happened in which none of them really appear
connected. Some are stories I have been told by family, some are things
I experienced myself, others there were more witnesses besides myself.</B>
<BR><B>Before, I describe the occurrences, I would like to say I have nothing
to gain by making them up. It's not my purpose to try to entertain. Yet,
your story has made me feel like I can very openly share what has also
happened to me.</B>
<BR><B>Okay now the experiences:</B>
<BR><B>My mom told me a story once that my dad told her about. He was working
as a police officer for the town I was born in. He and his partner had
been driving around policing the streets during a snowstorm. They happened
to see an old lady walking barefoot along a sidewalk and she wasn't even
wearing a coat. They pulled over and asked her if she needed a ride somewhere.
The lady looked at my dad and replied, "No dear, I have been walking these
streets now for centuries, I am doing well." With that they just let her
go on her way and left. Half-way down the road it hit them what she said.
They went back and she was gone, there was no footprints or any sign she
had passed along there.</B>
<BR><B>Another story concerning my Dad; He once told me when he was a child
his uncle lived upstairs on the second floor of their house. Well, after
he died, my dad would hear his uncle walking above on the second floor
and hear his cane tapping as he walked. After he died nobody else was up
there! A friend of my dad's once saw the uncle standing at the top of the
stairs and he got so scared he bolted from the house and never went back.</B>
<BR><B>Okay, now stories on my mom's side... that she has told me about.
My great grandmother one time was very sick and feverish, she awoke one
night to see a wisp of 'smoke' hovering above her bed and like a waving
hand calling her to follow. She got up and was looking at this mist and
following it. My great grandfather then awoke and saw it too. He got up
and made it to my great grandmother before she would have falling down
a flight of stairs.</B>
<BR><B>Two weeks after she died, my mom was out on the back porch hanging
laundry. This was also on a second floor so a view of the street was pretty
good. While she was out there she noticed a woman walking down the street
on the other side. When she got the where our house was, she turned and
looked up toward my mother. My mom swears it was her grandmother! The woman
smiled, waved then resumed her path.</B>
<BR><B>My sister as a child has seen a kitchen light turn off and on by
itself. She would check and everyone would be sleeping. When she returned
to bed the light would flick on and off again repeatedly.</B>
<BR><B>Being I didn't see these things I cannot confirm or deny them. So
I will just let be speculation. Now a few experiences I have had. Which
in any case isn't speculation as I know what I saw, or felt.</B>
<BR><B>When I was two or maybe three, I recall my room at night with a
nightlight on that gave sort of a pink glow to the room. In my mind's eye
I can see that room now. Where my bed against a south wall facing north.
On the north wall was a doorway to the left leading to the kitchen. the
longer part of the room extended east. On the far east of the room was
a window with heavy curtains on it. I use to awaken in the middle of the
night and be screaming in terror that a black lady was in my room near
that window. The scary thing about this lady was, she was decapitated!
And she was holding her head in both hands near her waist. I barely remember
what she looked like. I remember seeing her but forget the details. She
wasn't opaque, or gray or a wisp or anything like that, just a solid looking
woman with the grotesque details. There was one occurrence when I remember
her actually tossing the head at/toward me. I don't remember anything after
that. However, it was recurring so much it was starting to even scare my
parents. As they were actually starting to believe what I was seeing was
there even though they never saw it. We eventually moved and those occurrences
stopped. Never happened again. I believe what I was seeing was really there.
At that age, I was too younger to understand the concept of horror in that
way, my mind hadn't developed and imagination that bazaar, and also I was
still too young to recognize racial differences. Why wouldn't I "imagine"
a woman of my same race? If she was real, why would she be intentionally
trying to horrify me to death? Throwing a head at someone doesn't usually
gain a response like "thanks, let me know if you need it back!" :)</B>
<BR><B>Later on I would have dreams, recurring ones. Only twice in my life
have I had recurring dreams. This first one would show me a lady in my
dream. She would always be in our house and would be a trusted friend.
Yet whenever nobody was looking she would turn toward me and her face would
distort horizontally. In fact when I would awaken and tell my mother of
these dreams I would refer to her as the woman with the "stretchy-face."
I don't know where dreams like that can come from especially in a pre-school
child. I had those dreams, I don't know how many times. But sometimes they
would even be months apart. Yet always the same woman, always the same...
distortions. It seems now like it may have been sort of a message, but
until now... I don't understand what it would be.</B>
<BR><B>The second recurring dream that I had which still now occasionally
I have; I would be in a house. Mine I think. And in the basement is a door
in which every time I get close to it, I feel fire, and hear a hideous
growling from behind it. It is loud enough to scare me from the door. Yet
if I don't awaken then curiosity keeps drawing me toward that door! But
every time I get braver and close enough I get scared from it and no matter
how I adapt to what happens, it's scarier each time. I have never once
been able to open the door and see what is there on the other side. In
the real waking world the few I have told this dream to have told me to
never open that door. Another message?! Not sure.</B>
<BR><B>When I was around 9 or 10, I use to have feelings of being watched
when I went to bed. I would roll over as I slept on my side, to the other
side and would have an intense feeling of icy run through me but whatever
I thought was there would not be there. So I would roll back over and fall
asleep. This happened to me a lot. One night when I rolled over I caught
just the most brief fraction of a second of what I feel had always been
what was causing this feeling. On the edge of my bed I saw a woman's head!
Just the head sitting there looking at me, then it was gone before I could
know for certain I had really seen it.</B>
<BR><B>This was the last time I had any experiences with anything relating
to woman or something about a head or face. I am not certain why seeing
it actually made it never happen again. I don't even know if this even
made a difference. Yet it's never happened again.</B>
<BR><B>Nothing else had happened to me since until I was 14. A boy who
was once a neighbor of mine (we had since moved) in my early childhood
had been killed on a motorcycle at age 14. All I remembered of him was
he was not really very brilliant (a child's opinion) He was the kid we
all made fun of in school. Well after his death I start having sensations
on my paper route like he was in one of the homes I delivered the paper
to. It was only this one certain house. I would not even be thinking of
him, yet when I came to this certain house, he would rush into my imagination
and I would 'sense' him being in that second floor hallway. It got to the
point where I would bring my little brother with me for company... and
to deliver the paper to that one house! :)</B>
<BR><B>I got married at 19 years old. In our first apartment, the first
night we were there, I was awakened by my wife who was in terror and crying
her eyes out! I soon discovered why! We heard this loud pounding that sounded
like someone was trying to kick our front door in!!! Immediately I got
the cold chill and the raised hairs. I got up and we both left the bedroom.
The light outside shown bright enough we could see in the apartment without
having to turn on a light. Well. We got to the hallway that separated our
rooms and also had the front door leading to the main hall for the apartment
house. The door wasn't being kicked in. Instead it started again right
above that door! The sound was... weird! The best I can describe it was,
it was like someone picking a heavy object like a refrigerator and then
dropping it repeatedly every two seconds or so. Then I was really scared!
Nothing could make the sound we heard not without two or more people being
involved in the weight of this noise! Yet there was no physical damage
that we could see at all. What we were hearing sounded like it should have
come through the floor after three or four repetitions.</B>
<BR><B>Anyway we dismissed it later on even though we never learned what
it was. Some months later a friend of ours needed a place to stay and we
let her stay with us for some time. We had a spare room. Maybe five feet
away from what we heard that night. We had until that time been using it
for junk and storage. The door always closed. Now the strange thing about
this room was, it was at the front of the house and got the sun all day.
Yet when we were to go in there for something it was always very cool in
there. Having dismissed everything up to this point as imagination and
skepticism it was also ignored. One night the friend who was staying in
that room knocked on our bedroom door and asked us to please go in her
room for a few minutes. She wouldn't tell us why. So we just got up to
see what she wanted. Well all went in there without again turning on light.
But it was obvious to both my wife and I what she wanted us to witness!
All three of us heard a man breathing in that room!!! There was no man
in that room except me. I even held my breath to make sure it wasn't me.
It was a heavy breathing in which you almost hear part of the voice involved.
Like a deep breathing. After that night nothing ever happened in there
again. That I know of, we later switch apartments with neighbors in the
same house. (For other reasons of course!)</B>
<BR><B>Later we had problems and ended up separating for awhile. Once we
reconciled, we moved into this second floor apartment that also had a room
on the third floor and an attic that went the space of the whole house
with the exception of that one room and the stair well. I use to go up
in the attic to practice playing guitar so the amplifier wouldn't bother
anyone else present in the house. This attic was bare unfinished walls,
a sloping ceiling on each side also unfinished. The floor was the length
of the house but half as wide, while the rest was unfinished and filled
with insulation. Other than that there was nothing else except the chimney
that ran straight down to the basement. So I would have a metal folding
chair, my guitar and amp. I would sit there playing and be completely focused
on my playing and be completely lost to the outside world around me. But...
then I would feel that familiar icy finger up the spine, the neck hair
standing... I would turn around and nobody is there. So I would dismiss
it until it would happen so much I would feel too uneasy and leave. By
that point I was too scared to look back! I kept that to myself. I was
a married man had a new baby and I wasn't going to tell people about spooky
ghost! I want to add before I forget, I didn't like to use the small room
instead because it was very small and hot in there. Okay on to the rest.</B>
<BR><B>My brother lived in the apartment on the first floor. He would often
come up so he could also practice playing in the attic. He often told me
that it was very creepy up there and he felt like he was being watched!
Interesting! I never told anyone. But when he mentioned it, I told him
I felt like that too. After awhile neither of us would go up there much.
Well, life has a way of sucking sometimes and the marriage didn't work.
It got to the point where I would either sleep in a spare room on the second
floor, or the wife would sleep in the room next to the attic! (Her choice!)
The relationship got worse and worse all the time. I worked third shift
and would sleep most of the day hours. One day I woke up and heard a man
and woman talking. I was still half asleep and when I heard the voices,
I felt I knew who they were and there was no reason to be alarmed. So I
went back to sleep instantly. When I woke up, my wife was upset she had
come home to find our front door wide open. We only used the back door
and the front was always locked! Our TV was on the floor facing with the
screen side down, my guitar up in the attic was gone! So we basically felt
someone broke in yet there was no forced entry. I even wonder if my then
wife was involved in what happened. Yet it wasn't her voice I heard. When
I think about it, I don't know who the man and woman voices were! Anyhow
we divorced and she left. I was alone there with my cat. One night I am
watching TV and my very mellow cat comes seemingly out of nowhere, racing
down the stairs leading to the third floor! She come through the room so
fast, she got caught on the electrical cord to the TV and actually twisted
the TV on the stand so it was at a 45 degree angle from it's original position!
When I caught up with her at first I was upset thinking she was 'whacking
out' or something. Then I noticed her fur was standing thick and on end!
Her heart was pounding like she had been running for miles! This cat was
obviously terrified! Of what?! I was the only one there in the house. I
later moved out of that house too. For other reasons as I couldn't afford
to live there anymore. Anyhow that house is right down the street from
where I live at this moment and whenever I walk by, even though it has
been 14 years, I still feel a presence at that house... almost like I am
being watched from the window of that third floor little room next to the
attic.</B>
<BR><B>One other time I feel like I got a message from 'beyond.' I was
seeing this girl whom I was getting very close to. I loved her father dearly
as we had a lot in common, and he liked me a lot too! Anyhow the first
year (I forget the actually year) that "Earth Day" was made an official
holiday I had a bad feeling about it two months early. From the moment
I heard about it, I knew something didn't feel right. My girlfriend didn't
understand why, I didn't either. (yet)&nbsp; Anyhow those two months passed
and on Earth day we my girlfriend and her father went to visit her mom's
house. So we went to the cookout and were having a good time. Yet the whole
time her dad was seemingly down. He decided to leave. And her mom would
bring us back when it was over. Well a half hour passed, and then emergency
vehicles went racing by the house. That feeling came back again about Earth
Day and I finally convinced my girlfriend we should check it out. So while
we were getting ready her mom's boyfriend was ahead of us and left two
minutes before we did. On our way up the road he was returning on the other
side and told my girlfriend it was her dad. We got to the scene and saw
he had crashed into an on-coming car. Luckily both people were okay. Later
that day at the hospital we learned her dad had cancer and he died the
following Christmas morning.</B>
<BR><B>Anyway, since then nothing has occurred in my life which couldn't
be easily explained. Until this week. I am newly married and my wife is
in another country. We are waiting for the government red tape to go forth
so she can come here. Anyhow this week she sent me a greeting card. She
kept asking me in chat and on the phone if I got it. I did last Tuesday.
It came in the mail. I could also feel something else in it that was thick
maybe a costume necklace or bracelet. I brought it in and set it on my
computer. I had been up all night so just left it there and went to sleep.
When I awoke I had become involved in something... and had forgotten about
the card. Thursday night I was chatting with my wife again and she asked
if I had received anything yet. I told her I did and remembered I hadn't
opened it! I looked over to open it then and it was gone! Of course she
was sort of upset that I lost it and felt that it hadn't been important
to me. So I tossed my whole room upside down looking for it. Cleaned my
desk, looked behind the computer, under it, everywhere so to speak. I never
found it. Today, Saturday the mailman came and my sister brought my mail
in. In that mail was the card with the two bracelets inside! So now I think
my wife sent me two cards. I wrote her email today and asked her if she
had. She called me up and told me she sent only one card. She asked if
I liked the card and the bracelets. Of course I did! But... I am still
dumbfounded over what happened last Tuesday! Where did that card come from
and where did it go?!</B>
<BR><B>I look back on all of this and wonder, is something following me
through my life? Are they separate incidents in which I am very sensitive
and receptive to them? It's strange because I never saw lights, or mists
or anything like the other stories that have a lot in common, yet I wonder
what else can be at work regarding these things that seem unexplainable
to me? Sometimes when I am in a place where I cannot hear what's going
on around me, I often hear someone calling me. A few times in the shower,
while all I could hear is water running I would think I hear my dead grandmother
calling me from outside the bathroom. Even now whenever I listen to music
on the headphones, I will take them off and ask whoever is nearby. "What?!"
They would tell me that hadn't spoken. These are all little things that
can be easily dismissed sometimes, but I still wonder if the little things
ever add up to something else.</B>
<BR><B>Anyway those are my experiences and I told them to the best of my
ability. The way I remember experiencing them. Like most people I can be
skeptical yet, I am willing to believe also there is more than what we
understand. I welcome your opinions or explanations. I don't know much
about why I have experienced these things, but something inside tells me
whatever it was in that attic in my old apartment is still there even now.
I feel it whenever I pass that house and always look up to that third floor
window.</B>
<BR><B>Anyhow, Thank you for your time!</B>
