<b>Our New House</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: cr_cr99@yahoo.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>At first I didn't really believe my wife and my newly</b>
<br><b>purchased home was haunted, but the other night that</b>
<br><b>all changed.&nbsp; First some quick background information.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;The house is over 80 yr. old, built in 1919 for those</b>
<br><b>of you who aren't so quick with math : ), is a two</b>
<br><b>story bungalow style with three bedrooms and 1 &frac12;</b>
<br><b>baths.&nbsp; The house has been through two major remolding</b>
<br><b>renovations and is very beautiful inside and out.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>never really felt any "presence" in the house and</b>
<br><b>always felt very comfortable touring the house and</b>
<br><b>still do to this day living there, only a little</b>
<br><b>apprehensive lately.&nbsp; When we first moved in nothing</b>
<br><b>out of ordinary seemed to occur, but I kept miss</b>
<br><b>placing stuff I swore I know where I had placed, only</b>
<br><b>to locate the objects weeks, even once months later</b>
<br><b>sitting right in front of me.&nbsp; The best example is my</b>
<br><b>TV remote, a very important piece of equipment for me,</b>
<br><b>as is it for any man : )&nbsp; Shortly after moving in I</b>
<br><b>"miss placed" the remote even though I religious about</b>
<br><b>placing it back on top of the TV once I am finished</b>
<br><b>with it.&nbsp; My wife and I tore the house apart looking</b>
<br><b>for that thing, looking under, around and in the</b>
<br><b>couches, in the garage, bathrooms, bedrooms, ect, ect.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Once we gave up looking I broke down a bought a new</b>
<br><b>remote a week later.&nbsp; After a few months we were</b>
<br><b>watching a movie and my wife "found" the old TV remote</b>
<br><b>setting right next to her on the couch under a pillow.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Another instance, which began making me think</b>
<br><b>something was askew, was the following.&nbsp;&nbsp; We have a</b>
<br><b>two-yr. old son, who we bought a toddler bed for the</b>
<br><b>day we moved into the house so he could stop sleeping</b>
<br><b>in his cradle.&nbsp; After spending a few nights in the</b>
<br><b>house we started hearing our son get out of his bed</b>
<br><b>once we put him down for the night and run all over</b>
<br><b>the upstairs.&nbsp; The funny thing is every time we would</b>
<br><b>run up to catch him in the act, he was sound asleep.</b>
<br><b>Now, we also have three cats, but the entire time all</b>
<br><b>the noises were heard, they were asleep on the sofa.</b>
<br><b>We couldn't explain the noises, but wrote it off as</b>
<br><b>the house settling, or so I convinced my wife so she</b>
<br><b>wouldn't freak out, because they were obvious feet</b>
<br><b>steps.&nbsp; This would continue on and off but ended after</b>
<br><b>a while and was replaced by the sound of a baby crying</b>
<br><b>one evening.&nbsp; This really freaked my wife out and I</b>
<br><b>could explain this away.&nbsp; After putting our son down,</b>
<br><b>after a hr passed we began hearing the every so faint</b>
<br><b>cry of a baby.&nbsp; Every time we heard it we rushed up</b>
<br><b>stairs to see if our son was OK, only to find him fast</b>
<br><b>asleep.&nbsp; As the night progressed the crying became</b>
<br><b>very clear.&nbsp; We just ignored it, and after a second</b>
<br><b>night of it, it went away, as did the footsteps for</b>
<br><b>about three months.&nbsp; Nothing occurred during this time</b>
<br><b>of any major concern, only a few footsteps here and</b>
<br><b>there that can be explained away.&nbsp; That is until last</b>
<br><b>week.&nbsp; We had a really bad storm blow through and I</b>
<br><b>decided to go to bed early since my wife was working</b>
<br><b>really late and I was tired.&nbsp; Now remember our three</b>
<br><b>cats, while they were driving me crazy, running up and</b>
<br><b>down the stairs and jumping on the walls and running</b>
<br><b>all over the place.&nbsp; They pissed me off so bad I kept</b>
<br><b>screaming at them in the dark to stop it before they</b>
<br><b>woke up my son.&nbsp; The noises stopped after while and I</b>
<br><b>started to fall asleep.&nbsp; Now, in our room my wife and</b>
<br><b>I run a fan 24-7 because the air in our room gets</b>
<br><b>stale real fast and the fan helps prevent that.&nbsp; As I</b>
<br><b>kept drifting off I would hear voices, like a cocktail</b>
<br><b>party going on, through the fan noise.&nbsp; Every time I</b>
<br><b>would start to wake up and listen in harder, the</b>
<br><b>voices would quite down, and once I tried to pay no</b>
<br><b>attention I would hear the voice grow louder.&nbsp; This I</b>
<br><b>passed off as being my imagination and soon my wife</b>
<br><b>got home and crawled into bed with me.&nbsp; I told her</b>
<br><b>about the cats making all the noise and</b>
<br><b>low-and-behold, they started back up again. (Though I</b>
<br><b>didn't tell her about the voices).&nbsp; We ended up</b>
<br><b>closing our bedroom door and ignoring the cats the</b>
<br><b>rest of the night.&nbsp; The next morning my wife woke up</b>
<br><b>early and went down stairs, only to wake me up a few</b>
<br><b>moments later because she could find the cats, inside</b>
<br><b>or outside.&nbsp; She was really worried about them, so I</b>
<br><b>got up and started looking for them.&nbsp; I went out to</b>
<br><b>the detached garage and unlocked the door to see if</b>
<br><b>somehow they were in there and sure enough all three</b>
<br><b>were.&nbsp; They had followed me in there the night before</b>
<br><b>and got locked in there when I locked it up on my way</b>
<br><b>out.&nbsp; Happy we found the cats OK, we went in and</b>
<br><b>started breakfast, but then we remembered the noises</b>
<br><b>the night before.&nbsp; All the cats were locked in the</b>
<br><b>garage, so what made those noises.&nbsp; I didn't even try</b>
<br><b>to explain them away, because, they obviously</b>
<br><b>occurred.&nbsp; Since that night, the sounds are all back,</b>
<br><b>and I have heard the "cocktail party" voices again.</b>
<br><b>My wife and I are pretty sure we have a haunted house,</b>
<br><b>but by what we don't know.&nbsp; It's playful, loves to run</b>
<br><b>up and down the stairs, but has times it seems to get</b>
<br><b>very mad.&nbsp; Soon after the night we heard all the loud</b>
<br><b>noises my wife and I got in a really nasty argument.</b>
<br><b>I went to bed angry and she stayed up watching TV.</b>
<br><b>Once I got into bed I heard our front door (which is</b>
<br><b>below the master bedroom) slam shut and shake the</b>
<br><b>entire house.&nbsp; I swore the windows down stairs for</b>
<br><b>surely cracked or broke from the shaking.&nbsp; I ran down</b>
<br><b>stairs to get onto my wife for slamming the door that</b>
<br><b>hard and se the damage, but she was still watching TV</b>
<br><b>and had never moved.&nbsp; In fact, she didn't hear a thing</b>
<br><b>and was not 10 feet from the front door.&nbsp; That freaked</b>
<br><b>me out.</b>
<br><b>Just for a quick mention, other happens include; Doors</b>
<br><b>that were left shut are opened on return.&nbsp; Room</b>
<br><b>temperatures range from very cold to extremely hot no</b>
<br><b>matter the thermostat setting.&nbsp; Phantom calls, and</b>
<br><b>messages on our machine.&nbsp; Strange dreams and that</b>
<br><b>funny since of being watched from the upstairs windows</b>
<br><b>(doesn't matter which one) when every you are outside</b>
<br><b>walking around the house or in the front or back</b>
<br><b>yards.&nbsp; The big one, hearing our names being called,</b>
<br><b>investigating and finding the other didn't call the</b>
<br><b>other.</b>
<br><b>Thanks for reading my experiences.</b>

<br><b>Children Laughing</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: ILuvNa4Life2345@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Hello, i am a 12 year old girl from ohio. Ever since I was a little
girl I</b>
<br><b>had a strange interest in the super-natural. When I was 9 months
old, my</b>
<br><b>family lived in a haunted house. Of course I don't remember it,
but my</b>
<br><b>family swore that these stories were all true. Here are just a few
stories that I</b>
<br><b>was told ever since I could remember. One time, my father was sleeping</b>
<br><b>during the day. He was expected to go to work in the night. My mother
was</b>
<br><b>watching my sister and I play in the sandbox out back. All of a
sudden, my father</b>
<br><b>came bursting out into the backyard yelling at my mother to keep
those kids out</b>
<br><b>of my room when I am trying to sleep. My mother said what are you
talking</b>
<br><b>about, I was watching them the whole time. My father grew pale and
said are you</b>
<br><b>sure they weren't upstairs at all? No my mother answered. He then
told my</b>
<br><b>mother that someone kept pulling on his toes and then started to
laugh. He said</b>
<br><b>it was a child's laughter. There are other stories too.</b>

<br><b>Pikes Peak House</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Dell.Martin@lsil.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>My family and I live in a house that was a bunk house on top of Pikes</b>
<br><b>Peak, in Colorado.&nbsp; This bunk house was built in the early
1900's for the</b>
<br><b>employees that were building the road and railroad that goes to
the top.</b>
<br><b>In the early 1970's the Forest Service sold it to a lady by the
name of</b>
<br><b>Martha. She had to have it moved off the mountain and put on a new
foundation.</b>
<br><b>The house now sits 14 miles north of Cripple Creek.&nbsp; (Which
is an old miners</b>
<br><b>town where gold was discovered in the 1800's)</b>
<br><b>When we first looked through this house to buy, my husband and I
felt a</b>
<br><b>presence, but it was a comforting feeling.&nbsp; We are into old
things</b>
<br><b>(houses, antiques, old cars etc).&nbsp; This was not the first presence
that we had</b>
<br><b>lived with in ours lives.&nbsp; But that is another story.</b>
<br><b>We started hearing voices, children talking, foot steps, blurred
images.</b>
<br><b>But nothing to really startle us.&nbsp; At night for a while I would
go to bed</b>
<br><b>before my husband and feel someone getting into bed beside me.&nbsp;
But of</b>
<br><b>course when ever I would look no one would be there.</b>
<br><b>My husband would be laying on the couch at night watching t.v. and
would</b>
<br><b>feel someone sit in the chair next to him and no one be there.</b>
<br><b>I came home late one evening and as my head lights swept across
the front</b>
<br><b>of the house, I saw a little boy standing by the garage door.&nbsp;
It was just</b>
<br><b>for a second, but I can tell you exactly what he looked like.&nbsp;
His age was</b>
<br><b>about 6-7 years of age, he had on a brown plaid jacket with brown
nickers.&nbsp; He</b>
<br><b>had the brown long socks with brown shoes.&nbsp; He wore on this
head a brown</b>
<br><b>billed cap that boys would wear in the early 1900's.</b>
<br><b>Where we live we have no neighbors.&nbsp; We have state park on
two sides of us</b>
<br><b>and across the street it is national forest.&nbsp; So I know that
it would not</b>
<br><b>be neighbors.</b>
<br><b>My husband was out chopping wood for our wood stove and heard a
child</b>
<br><b>calling out Dad, he thought that it was our daughter, but about
that time</b>
<br><b>our daughter came outside.</b>
<br><b>When we argue like most couples the house does not like it.&nbsp;
We hear so</b>
<br><b>many bumps and growns that we try not to disagree.</b>
<br><b>We have quite a few stories, but my husband and I agree that what
we feel</b>
<br><b>is a very loving secure feeling.&nbsp; I hope that this continues
because we are</b>
<br><b>very comfortable in our house.</b><b></b>

<br><b>The House on 10th Street</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: pvicenti@salud.unm.edu</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>In April of 1969 my husband and I moved into our first house.&nbsp;
It was</b>
<br><b>small, only 4 rooms, but very well designed.&nbsp; Rectangle shaped,
the</b>
<br><b>living room took up the front Third of the house, next came the
kitchen</b>
<br><b>with the bathroom beside it, and the rear third of the house had
two</b>
<br><b>bedrooms each with a door and separated with a linen closet between
the</b>
<br><b>two doors.&nbsp; Also, there was one large closet between the two
bedrooms.</b>
<br><b>Each bedroom had a door opening onto the closet.&nbsp; The first
two months</b>
<br><b>we lived there were unexceptional.&nbsp; We had chosen the bedroom
on the</b>
<br><b>east side of the house because it was cooler and I was pregnant.&nbsp;
Two</b>
<br><b>months after we moved in, our landlord died.&nbsp; He was over 80,
confined</b>
<br><b>to a wheelchair, cranky due to ill health, but a rather nice, and</b>
<br><b>interesting older gentleman.&nbsp; No sooner had he gone on to his
reward</b>
<br><b>than I noticed the atmosphere of our house had changed.&nbsp; I
would be</b>
<br><b>lying on the couch in the living room when suddenly I would hear
steps</b>
<br><b>in the kitchen which would proceed to the back of the house.&nbsp;
Our</b>
<br><b>bedroom started to feel like we had company.&nbsp; No problem I
said.&nbsp; The</b>
<br><b>rent was too good to give up and the house was quaint and cozy.&nbsp;
We</b>
<br><b>moved into the other bedroom, shifted our clothes to the other side
of</b>
<br><b>the closet, closed and locked the closet door in the old bedroom,
and</b>
<br><b>closed and locked the bedroom door to the old bedroom.&nbsp; This
just left</b>
<br><b>the occasional footsteps.&nbsp; I asked a friend of our landlords
family if</b>
<br><b>anyone had ever died in the house.&nbsp; She looked at me uneasily
and so</b>
<br><b>that so far as she knew, no.&nbsp; The owner had built the house
in the</b>
<br><b>1930's for his daughter and her new husband.&nbsp; They lived there
for over</b>
<br><b>20 years, and after they moved to their own house, the owner rented
it.</b>
<br><b>Shortly after this conversation, I was sitting on the porch just
before</b>
<br><b>sundown.&nbsp; It gets to be over 100 degrees in Portales, NM and
early July</b>
<br><b>is unbelievable.&nbsp; I looked over to the west to check the position
of the</b>
<br><b>sun, and saw a truly remarkable sight.&nbsp; In the vacant lot beside
our</b>
<br><b>house, there were about two dozen horned toads.&nbsp; They were
sitting</b>
<br><b>slightly elevated, sort of like a dog sits but not so straight up.&nbsp;
They</b>
<br><b>were very still, and they were all facing towards the sunset.&nbsp;
They</b>
<br><b>stayed in this position until the set set.&nbsp; I know nothing
about horned</b>
<br><b>toads, but I don't think they live together in colonies, nor have
I ever</b>
<br><b>heard or read of behavior like these toads exhibited.&nbsp; However,
that</b>
<br><b>house was peculiar, so why not strange behavior in the wildlife?&nbsp;
Three</b>
<br><b>months after we moved in, I had to wake my husband from a very bad</b>
<br><b>nightmare.&nbsp; He dreamed that he had gone home and no one was
there, so he</b>
<br><b>went into the kitchen and saw his mother.&nbsp; When she turned
to face him,</b>
<br><b>he said that she "looked like she was dead".&nbsp; He was moaning
and</b>
<br><b>struggling in his sleep and so that was&nbsp; when I woke him up.&nbsp;
His mother</b>
<br><b>did in fact die within the year.&nbsp; Four months after we had
moved into</b>
<br><b>the house, I went to stay with my parents due to a difficult pregnancy.</b>
<br><b>One week after I had arrived at my parents home, my husband showed
up at</b>
<br><b>the door.&nbsp; I was pleased, but surprised.&nbsp; Later that evening,
he told me</b>
<br><b>that he had had a bad experience in the house.&nbsp; When pressed,
he told me</b>
<br><b>he had been having what seemed like a vivid dream of someone walking
in</b>
<br><b>the kitchen, but he knew I was gone, and the lights were off.&nbsp;
He then</b>
<br><b>realized that he was not asleep, he tried the pinch method, and</b>
<br><b>painfully determined that he was definitely awake.&nbsp; However,
he began to</b>
<br><b>sincerely wish he was asleep because he saw a faint glow approaching
the</b>
<br><b>bedroom doorway.&nbsp; It turned out to be a figure which stood
in the</b>
<br><b>doorway looking at him.&nbsp; He said he could only make out the
shape, no</b>
<br><b>features, only that it was tall and seemed to have something in
its</b>
<br><b>hand.&nbsp; When he yelled at it, it disappeared.&nbsp; He said
that he stayed</b>
<br><b>awake the rest of the night, went to work, and told his employer
he had</b>
<br><b>to go home on an emergency.&nbsp; From work he drove straight to
my parents</b>
<br><b>house.&nbsp; What I found interesting about his story was the footsteps.
I</b>
<br><b>never told him I heard footsteps.&nbsp; I never told him that I
felt</b>
<br><b>something else in the house, and the reason I gave for changing
bedrooms</b>
<br><b>was that the wallpaper was so ugly, which it was, that I couldn't
stand</b>
<br><b>looking at it anymore.&nbsp; I never even considered telling him
about what</b>
<br><b>was going on.&nbsp; We had only been married 7 months when the interesting</b>
<br><b>events started.&nbsp; I did not want him to think he had married
a crazy</b>
<br><b>person, or that pregnancy had unhinged my mind.&nbsp; Fortunately,
he had no</b>
<br><b>such worries when he told me about his little adventure.&nbsp; We
left our</b>
<br><b>newborn son with my mother, and within a month, we had found an</b>
<br><b>apartment and moved.</b><b></b>

<br><b>The Watch</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Fiero25@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This story was told to me by my uncle.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
His uncle had a pocket watch</b>
<br><b>he recieved for 20 some years of service in the railroad.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
He requested</b>
<br><b>that when he died that the pocket watch was with his body in the
casket ,</b>
<br><b>instead his wife kept the watch and gave it to her son, against
his last</b>
<br><b>wishes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the time my uncles aunt lived out in
the country some 50 or so</b>
<br><b>miles away from my uncle.&nbsp;&nbsp; A couple of days after the
funeral&nbsp; my uncle's</b>
<br><b>aunt wanted to move closer to my uncle and out of the big house
that she</b>
<br><b>lived in and get a single trailer that was cheaper.&nbsp;&nbsp;
A couple of days after</b>
<br><b>she moved she called my uncle who was in his 20's{ he is now in
his 50's}to</b>
<br><b>spend the weekend and help her with moving in and setting up the
furniture</b>
<br><b>and all.&nbsp;&nbsp; The first night that he spent&nbsp; he couldn't
get comfortable he said</b>
<br><b>it felt something big was about to happen, like a bomb was about
to go off.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
He tossed and turned for 3 or 4 hours</b>
<br><b>when in the next room he heard his aunt struggling with something
,he jumped</b>
<br><b>out of bed and into the next room to see his aunt being strangled
by unseen</b>
<br><b>hands ,when he came into the room far enough it stopped . His aunt
was pretty</b>
<br><b>shaken up by it . The next night was what changed my uncle into
a believer</b>
<br><b>,when he heard the same noise from the night before ,he jumped up
,got out</b>
<br><b>into the hallway and saw his first ghost . Standing at the end of
the hallway</b>
<br><b>was his dead uncle and he spoke to my uncle , he said "Where's&nbsp;
Marie at ?'</b>
<br><b>[Marie is my moms name ] then vanished . The next day my uncle went
home . A</b>
<br><b>couple of days later she called him again and said she needed to
talk to him</b>
<br><b>about something. He went to her house and knocked on the door but
no one</b>
<br><b>answered&nbsp; so he opened the unlocked door and went inside ,he
called to his</b>
<br><b>aunt but no one answered so he went into her bedroom and all of
the drawers</b>
<br><b>were yanked out all over the floor . Laying on the floor across
the room was</b>
<br><b>his aunt ,dead.&nbsp; Revenge from the grave?</b>

<p><b>Should I Beleave</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: Starboard1@prodigy.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>Well, I just came to this website tonight and decided to read some
of the</b>
<br><b>stories, they made me think of the stories my dad tells me all the
time,</b>
<br><b>as for me Ive never really seen anything but allways felt that something
was</b>
<br><b>watching me while I sleep other than that my life as been spirit
free.</b>
<br><b>Well anyway here's my story, I was in Kentucky at my grandmothers
house,</b>
<br><b>me my dad and my grandmother were sitting at the table telling ghost</b>
<br><b>stores....this one my grandma told me has stuck in my mind for years,</b>
<br><b>years ago when my dad, his brothers and sisters still lived at home,
they lived</b>
<br><b>in what seems a normal house.&nbsp; My grandma was up getting ready
for work,</b>
<br><b>everyone else was gone, eather for school or work except for my
aunt</b>
<br><b>Stella...she was up sleeping in her room.&nbsp; My grandma was down
in the</b>
<br><b>kitchen making some coffe and in the kitchen was the door that led
to the</b>
<br><b>basement.&nbsp; Well she was at the table sipping her coffe when
she heard a</b>
<br><b>thud, it souned like it came from the very bottom in the basement
on the</b>
<br><b>last step and continued to move up step by step but it didnt sound
like</b>
<br><b>footsteps rather someone of something dragging itself up the steps
slowly.</b>
<br><b>My grandma being the brave little lady that she is grabed a pan
and waited</b>
<br><b>till it got to the top of the steps, then quickly unlatched the
door and</b>
<br><b>swung that pan hitting nothing but air, nothing was at the top.&nbsp;
She</b>
<br><b>closed the door and woke my aunt up and told her to go and stay
at a friends</b>
<br><b>house. They lived there for years and years and one day everyone
was out</b>
<br><b>of the house for the afternoon except my dad, well anyways he was
in the</b>
<br><b>basement working on the carbuerator of his car at a tool bench,
the</b>
<br><b>basement was directly below the living room, as he was sitting at
the</b>
<br><b>bench he heard something slowly walk across the livingroom floor...now
me and my</b>
<br><b>family are very religious so my dad didnt think anything of it...he</b>
<br><b>thought someone might be home so he went upstairs and looked around
and found</b>
<br><b>noone so he returned to the basement to continue to work, about
5mins later he</b>
<br><b>heard it again and then again, the third time he ran upstairs as
fast as</b>
<br><b>he could with hammer in hand he made it halfway up the stairs when
he triped</b>
<br><b>and fell down the stairs he got up and ran right back up and again
found</b>
<br><b>nothing, they later moved from that house.&nbsp; Theres plenty other
stories</b>
<br><b>they have told me and maybe I'll send some more.&nbsp; Again as
for me Ive seen</b>
<br><b>things out of the corner of my eyes in one of my moms friends house
who of</b>
<br><b>which her husband had recently died, I quickly found my mother and
wouldnt</b>
<br><b>leave her side, im now 18 and live with my mom still in Michigan
in a</b>
<br><b>trailor park, and in the area very near by is where indians used
to live</b>
<br><b>and one of my friends told me that the park is thier burial site,
im not</b>
<br><b>sure if I beleave it or not cause ive never really had anything
to me</b>
<br><b>here, but there is an errie fog that falls the area and since its
a new park</b>
<br><b>were surrond by woods, the fog seems to seap from the woods and
falls on your</b>
<br><b>park.&nbsp; Other than that I have no reason to by that storie.&nbsp;
Well I hope</b>
<br><b>whoever reads this story enjoys it.&nbsp; Thanks for the time.</b>

<p><b>Some Are Dead and Some are Living !</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: Annpryor@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I consider myself to be a spiritual person, but I've never seen ghosts.
So it surprised me when I actually felt spirits lurking around me in a
quiet hotel corridor.</b>
<br><b>It began as a pilgrimage to see the Beatles. I was in England with
my boyfriend and he suggested we take a roadtrip to Liverpool to see the
Beatles Museum. He even went so far as to hook up a discounted suite at
the Adelphi Hotel, a famous resting spot in the city's center that had
been host to the Rolling Stones and other famous celebrities throughout
the years. Located on the Mersey River, Liverpool has for almost three
centuries been a port town with a high concentration of immigrants from
all over Europe and the United Kingdom. The hotel had been the overnight
stay of first-class passengers on the great cruise ships travelling to
faraway ports like Cherbourg, Southampton, and New York.</b>
<br><b>We drove across the middle of England from East to West, and a few
hours later we arrived in the depressed outskirts of Liverpool. It had
been suggested that we lock our doors and keep our eyes peeled for criminals,
and as we drove through the City I noticed run-down neighborhoods, exhaust-blackened
buildings and intense poverty. The whole place reminded me of Newark, only
much older. We finally found the Adelphi, a massive, sprawling structure
that filled a whole city block, much like the Waldorf-Astoria, but about
80 years older. I checked us in and got the room key, as my boyfriend Den
circled around the block outside in the car. I got a voucher from the concierge
for the hotel parking lot.</b>
<br><b>We drove up in front of a corrugated tin door waiting for the attendant
to let us in from the rain. He met us in full hotel regalia and helped
us pluck our luggage from the car. He then led us through the back entrance
of the hotel, and as he did so, we passed through a giant hallway with
empty ballrooms stretching out on either side.</b>
<br><b>Either suffering from an active imagination or having watched The
Shining too many times, I could see the ballrooms filled with the images
of parties of the past. There were the ladies dressed in their bustled
skirts, men in dark suits with black bowties and handlebar moustaches,
clinking glasses, smoking cigars and celebrating galas of old. For some
reason, I instantly got a case of the creeps and knew there was more to
this hotel than sprawling, vacant banquet halls. It was as though all those
party-goers had their eyes on us. The sheer size of the layout of the place,
the endless array of empty rooms and that feeling that they were in fact
NOT empty, was unsettling - and not a feeling I'd ever had before.</b>
<br><b>We were led from one massive room into another, and finally came
upon an enormous lobby that had a few people lounging, having tea. I felt
instantly relieved. PEOPLE! Living people! Women and children! No creepy
encounters there.</b>
<br><b>We dragged our bags into a rickety elevator that opened on the 3rd
floor, a musty, dark, wide hallway that led into the darkness, lined with
black marble. I hadn't told Den of my heebie-jeebies, but suddenly he started
to feel a little freaked out, as well. All our fears seemed to intensify
as we made our way down the corridor, and our room seemed a million miles
away. As he fiddled with the door's key, I felt like we were being watched
by a male presence at the far end of the hall. I felt compelled to take
a look behind me just to be sure there wasn't really anyone there.</b>
<br><b>After splashing some water on our grimy faces (and a chance for
me to reapply my makeup), we made our way down to the hotel pub (clutching
hands tightly the whole way there.) We ordered up a few beers and the barladies
(they sounded just like Ringo!) began to give us a little backstory about
the place. They told us indeed the hotel was haunted - one of the girls
couldn't be specific but she said there had been a murder and a recent
suicide there. She claimed the hotel had been designed by a Mr. Atkinson
of the White Star Lines (the firm that later went on to design and build
the Titanic.) There were apparently pieces of the Mauritania built into
the hotel's structure (this ship, too, went down, with many casualties.)
The kicker, however, was when one of girls said she often felt like she
was being watched, and had a tendency to look over her shoulder when she
was by herself!</b>
<br><b>The next day, in full and glorious daylight (on our way to the Beatles
Museum), we stopped in a bookshop that had THREE books on haunted Liverpool.
I bought two of them, written by author and life-long Liverpudlian Thomas
Slemen. There was no mention of the Adelphi Hotel, but plenty of spooky
stories of hauntings, sightings, and visitations in the city, the majority
of them disturbingly recent.</b>
<br><b>I finally made contact with Mr. Slemen about 5 months later, and
he has ever since been sending me stories about the Adelphi and its place
in haunted history. Both Charles Dickens and Winston Churchill stayed at
the hotel, and they both had haunted encounters. Guests have seen spirits
in their rooms, sitting at the foot of their beds - heard and felt strange
presences, and everyone we have spoken to about the hotel always blurt
out that the place is haunted as hell.</b>
<br><b>This Gotham girl, who doesn't even believe what she reads in the
papers and is frightened by tangible things like rats, bosses and thugs,
the undeniable presence of supernatural spirits has been hard to grasp.
After writing to Mr. Slemen and discussing our incident at length, my boyfriend
revealed some vital over least six months later. The morning we were to
check out, he was shaving while I was in the bathroom taking a shower.
While staring at himself in the mirror he saw the image of a man in olde-time
clothing wearing a white shirt with a black jacket, with fair skin, slicked-back
black hair and a pencil moustache. He told me he was too afraid to mention
anything to me for fear I might be paralysed with fright in our hotel room.
The spookiest part is, before he had ever made mention to me of the black-haired
man, I got an e-mail from Tom Slemen in Liverpool about a man with slicked
back black hair and pencil moustache who had committed suicide in the hotel
in the 1930s. He had even been seen in the windows by various guests, and
Liverpool policemen!</b>
<br><b>Something beyond my understanding exists within the walls the Adelphi
Hotel Liverpool. I may never comprehend all the residual misery and history
that lurks within the hotel, but I can't deny that it has a myriad of spirit
guests that share its rooms with us lucky living folks, and aren't leaving
any time soon.</b>

<p><b>Boy was I glad to see your page! We have been living with a ghost
for a</b>
<br><b>little over a year. We bought our used mobile home and moved it
to a lot</b>
<br><b>that we bought. At first we thought we were hearing thing. Settlings
and</b>
<br><b>things like that. Then I would hear someone walking up the hall
through</b>
<br><b>the day,everyone else was at school and work. A couple times our
front</b>
<br><b>door was open when we got up in the morning and we know we locked
it the</b>
<br><b>night before. I was talking to my sister on the phone one day and
the</b>
<br><b>ceiling fan stopped. I said "Oh no,the ceiling fan broke I think."
I got</b>
<br><b>up and pulled the string and it came on! Just like it had been turned</b>
<br><b>off. I left it on,sat back down and it stopped again. I got up and</b>
<br><b>turned it back on and said "Ok this is silly now" and it didn't
happen</b>
<br><b>again.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Little things like that kept happening. Then one night I fell
asleep in</b>
<br><b>the living room while watching tv. The static from the tv woke me.
The</b>
<br><b>satellite receiver box had been turned off. I got up and there she
was!</b>
<br><b>I could see her but I could see the tv through her too. She was
a little</b>
<br><b>girl,maybe 8 or 9 years old. Dark,like Indian or spanish. Well,I
can</b>
<br><b>tell ya I didn't sleep the rest of the night. My husband didn't
believe</b>
<br><b>me,til he was here one weekend alone while I was visiting family.
He</b>
<br><b>called and said you were right,but she was standing beside an old
man</b>
<br><b>who was sitting at the table. Sometimes I can feel their presence,most</b>
<br><b>of the time I ignore it. They don't bother us,just do enough to
let us</b>
<br><b>know they're there. We are not scared,we have learned to live with
it</b>
<br><b>and the kids think it's cool. LOL,Letitia O.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Our Rental</b><b></b>
<p><b>BY: tfariss@earthlink.net</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Annie and I were staying in a very small rental adjacent to a garage.</b>
<br><b>The apartment consisted of one room and a second room that was a</b>
<br><b>kitchen/ bathroom. Let's put it this way, you could lean out of
the</b>
<br><b>shower while shampooing and stir your dinner on the heating grill.</b>
<br><b>Anyway, one evening I was in the frontroom(bedroom) and Annie was
in the</b>
<br><b>other washing Taylor's (our youngests) hair. I was sitting on the
bed</b>
<br><b>looking at a magazine when all the sudden a deep voice spoke out
what</b>
<br><b>sounded like "Annie." I looked up and sat there trying to figure
out</b>
<br><b>what that was, after a long. long pause, Annie yelled "what!" to
me and</b>
<br><b>came stomping in wondering what "I" had wanted. All I could do was
look</b>
<br><b>at her and very stunned say to her "I didn't call you." And she
just</b>
<br><b>looked at me. We didn't lots of noises or things move just that
one</b>
<br><b>incident. The voice sounded as though it came out of the stereo.
I had</b>
<br><b>checked it and the power was off. This was 4 years ago, today Annie</b>
<br><b>still asks me once in a while if that voice really wasn't me. And
it</b>
<br><b>wasn't.</b>

<br><b>A Christmas Friend</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: bigsexy1@mailhost.col.ameritech.net</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Since it is the hollidays, I thought that this story would fit the</b>
<br><b>season.</b>
<br><b>This story was told to me by my Grandmother. It takes place when
the</b>
<br><b>Vietnam war was going on.</b>
<br><b>Grandma and Grandpa were going to my great uncle's house on Christmas</b>
<br><b>eve. On the way there, they seen a young soldier on the corner with
his</b>
<br><b>duffel bag at his side. My Grandfather stopped to see if he needed
a</b>
<br><b>ride. The young man accepted. He didn't say much until he told them</b>
<br><b>where they could let him off. My Grandpa stopped the car he the
young</b>
<br><b>man got out. When my Grandma turned to wave to him, he was nowhere
to be</b>
<br><b>seen. They even got out of the car to see if they could find him.</b>
<br><b>The kind of freaky part is that the next year, on Christmas eve,
they</b>
<br><b>took the same young man to the same place and the same thing happened.</b>
<br><b>The only thing different was that my Grandma asked him if they gave
him</b>
<br><b>a ride last year. The young man said "Maybe so." I've often thought</b>
<br><b>about riding by the same corner on Christmas eve to see if he is
still</b>
<br><b>there and give him a ride.</b>
