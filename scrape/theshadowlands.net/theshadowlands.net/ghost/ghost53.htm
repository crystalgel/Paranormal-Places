<H3><A NAME=the>The Screeching</A>
</H3><P><B>by beachcomber@kih.net</B>
<P>
<P><B> I have had only one paranormal experience.  It happened last October
when my boyfriend had temporarily rented a trailer.  We had lived there for

almost two months and nothing out of the ordinary had happened.  One afternoon,

he decided to take a nap and I was in the living room watching t.v.  I started

hearing this really strange continuous screeching noise.  It sounded like
it was coming from inside the wall beside his bedroom door.  When I walked
over there, it stopped.  I sat back down and started watching t.v. again
and it started back again.  This time, I walked into the kitchen (the bedroom
was right beside the kitchen) and I started opening the bottom cabinets and
once again the screeching stopped.  I never said anything about it to my

boyfriend because I didn't think a lot about it at the time.  A couple of
days later, we were in the kitchen eating breakfast and he told me that the
day before, when he was there by himself, that he had heard a weird, loud

screeching noise.  He said he tried to find where it was coming from and
it would stop when he'd look.  I told him that the same thing had happened
to me while he was asleep a few days earlier.  We both talked about ghosts
and laughed about it, pretty much dismissing it as a joke.  A few nights
later, his mom came stayed all night and was asleep on the living room couch.

 This particular night, we were sleeping in the bedroom on the opposite end
of the trailer.  It was really late, probably around 3:00 a.m., and we had
been laying there talking when I started hearing this noise.  It was kind
of like the screeching, but much quiter, and screeched in intervals, like

footsteps.  I thought my boyfriend had his hand dropped over the side of
the bed making that noise with his hand against the plastic on the mattress.
 I said "Brian, quit making that noise".  He said "I'm not making that noise"
and held up both of his hands.  He looked at me as scared as I looked back
at him and he said "get up and get dressed"  As soon as he said that, you
could actually tell where the screeching was moving through the room to the

corner beside the bed and feel this undescribable presence and all of a sudden

the screeching just went crazy and so loud.  It was right there.  Needless
to say, within a split second, it was the only one there.  Now can you imagine,

two grown adults running into the living room to wake up his mom.   She said
she hadn't heard anything, but that we had scared her to death running through

the living room at 3:00 in the morning like we were on fire.  We sat up in
the living room for the rest of the night and moved back to his mom's house

within the week.   So far, that's the only experience that I've had.</B>

<H3><A NAME=warehouse>Goodyear Warehouse</A>
</H3><P><B>by sputnik@en.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>Ok, Here is a story I heard from my dad.....</B>
<P><B>My dad used to work in a wharehouse at the goodyear facilities in</B>
<P><B>Akron, Ohio.    There where stories floating around about various</B>
<P><B>ghosts and whatnot, associated with the various buildings in the

plant</B>
<P><B>campus (which, if you have ever visited Akron, you know, sprawls over</B>
<P><B>a vast area)  One of these stories involved a ghost that followed you</B>
<P><B>thru various warehouses as you walked, and was never seen, only</B>
<P><B>heard...  My dad was always working swing shift at this plant (very</B>
<P><B>little seniority), so he was there at all kinds of wacky hours.  One</B>
<P><B>night, in the winter, he was working the midnight shift, in one of

the</B>
<P><B>supposedly "haunted" buildings.  There was only 4 guys in this</B>
<P><B>particular buildings, and my dad, being the "rookie" in the place was</B>
<P><B>given all the crappy jobs.  At about 3 in the morning, my dads</B>
<P><B>supervisor instucted him to go to the 3rd floor of this building,

back</B>
<P><B>in the oldest part of it, to pick up some flourescent lights, because</B>
<P><B>the small storage area in the machine room, was out of them, and they</B>
<P><B>needed to replace a few.  So being as superstitious as you can be,
my</B>
<P><B>dad was "sure" he was gonna see a ghost, in that very dark, very</B>
<P><B>scary, old building.  Up the dark stairs my dad went one by one,

sweat</B>
<P><B>pouring off his face (even though, this part of the building was</B>
<P><B>barely heated) when he finally reached the 3rd floor, he felt a

little</B>
<P><B>stronger, (probably adrenalin) so he bravely pushed open the door to</B>
<P><B>the adjoining room between the stairwell, and the storage room.  This</B>
<P><B>room, used to be a rubber cutting room, and wasnt used for anything</B>
<P><B>anymore, since manual rubber cutting was no longer done.  There were

a</B>
<P><B>few large containers sitting around, but for the most part the room</B>
<P><B>was empty. there was a thick layer of dust covering most of the room,</B>
<P><B>except for a small path where people walked to get various items from</B>
<P><B>the storage room. Spiderwebs everywhere, and the occasional "squeek"</B>
<P><B>from a disgruntled rat, were just enough to give my dad the total</B>
<P><B>spine chills, but he pushed on, being a "man" and not supposed to be</B>
<P><B>afraid of anything.  He started walking across the abandoned rubber</B>
<P><B>cutting room, toward the storage area, when very faintly, he heard</B>
<P><B>footsteps behind him!  Whirling around ready to fight he peered into</B>
<P><B>the dimness, nothing was there... he assumed it was his nerves, which</B>
<P><B>he had worked into a frenzy by this point, and he turned quickly,</B>
<P><B>embarassed, and continued toward the storage area, when sure enough,</B>
<P><B>more footsteps, he slowed, they slowed, he sped up, they sped up.</B>
<P><B>With his heart racing, he slowly turned around, still nothing was</B>
<P><B>there! Drenched with sweat, and scared nearly to tears, he bolted</B>
<P><B>towards the storage room, his feet pounding heavily on the thin metal</B>
<P><B>floor, the footseps where even louder now, every step he took,

another</B>
<P><B>step followed, not an echo, but RIGHT BEHIND HIM!  He made it to the</B>
<P><B>storage room, fumbled with the lock, ran inside and slammed the door</B>
<P><B>behind him. the room was very small, all he could hear was the</B>
<P><B>pounding of his heart, threatening to blow right thru his chest.  The</B>
<P><B>only way out was the way he came!  After calming down a bit, and</B>
<P><B>smoking about 5 cigarettes, he was feeling brve again.  He grabbed
a</B>
<P><B>large box of lights, decided to fling open the door, and run like</B>
<P><B>hell, as fast as he could cover the 50 -75 feet to the stairwell.</B>
<P><B>Getting up his nerve, he grabbed the doorhandle, he slowly turned it,</B>
<P><B>as soon as he heard the click of the latch opening, he FLUNG opened</B>
<P><B>the door, and sprinted toward the light in the stairwell.  There

where</B>
<P><B>the footsteps again closer than ever, right behind him, Thats when
it</B>
<P><B>happened, tripping over something, he sprawled head first into the</B>
<P><B>darkness.  Total quiet met him. darkness and quiet, he slowly rose
to</B>
<P><B>his feet, putting one hand behind him to help him get to his feet,

the</B>
<P><B>weight of his body pressing against the floor thru his hand, made a</B>
<P><B>small "dent" in the floor, when he removed his hand, the floor</B>
<P><B>"popped" back to its original position.  THE FOOTSTEPS! Feeling</B>
<P><B>totally embarassed, he rose to his feet, and walked back to his</B>
<P><B>co-workers, never telling any of them what he found.  Years later he</B>
<P><B>still tells stroies about sending the new "rookies" up there in the</B>
<P><B>middle of a dark night, when all is quiet, to walk across the metal</B>
<P><B>floored room, to get lightbulbs that arent really needed.</B>

<H3><A NAME=light>The Light</A>
</H3><P><B>by gumbysgrl@prodigy.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>I was sitting in a locked kitchen remodeling store answering phones

on</B>
<P><B>Saturday afternoon for a friend.  I was reading in between calls and</B>
<P><B>patting the "store" cat.  As I was reading my book, I saw out of the

corner</B>
<P><B>of my eye, a light source move from behind me to the front on my left

side.</B>
<P><B> My subconscious told me that it was just the sunlight bouncing off

the</B>
<P><B>windshield of a car out on the highway.  Then I remembered... it was

cloudy</B>
<P><B>and the sun was behind the clouds.  I looked up and the light source

was</B>
<P><B>gone.  And so was the cat.  I found him in a corner of a cabinet

beneath</B>
<P><B>one of the kitchen sink displays and afraid to come out.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I told the owner about it and was sort of laughing at myself.  He

said,</B>
<P><B>"Oh, you saw it."  He told me that he didn't want to scare me so he

didn't</B>
<P><B>tell me that the store was haunted.</B>

<H3><A NAME=us>Toys R Us</A>
</H3><P><B>by sauters@earthlink.net </B>
<P>
<P><B>According to your "haunted places index" you are already aware of the</B>
<P><B>Toys R Us in Sunnyvale, California.  About 12 or 13 years ago I

worked</B>
<P><B>there, as a stocker.  I never actually saw anything directly, but

there</B>
<P><B>were two instances I was aware of.  First, in the rear stockroom,</B>
<P><B>towards the back of the building and on the second floor where all

the</B>
<P><B>spare and unassembled display racks were kept.  There I had this</B>
<P><B>disturbing feeling that although I needed to go up there, I felt like</B>
<P><B>there was something keeping me from doing this.  Sort of a thought
of</B>
<P><B>"no, don't go there" type of feeling.  No actual physical contact,

not</B>
<P><B>to me personally.  A co-worker described then what she thought were</B>
<P><B>fingers going through her hair.  The second time was what really made

me</B>
<P><B>think about this place.  One night, when we re-stock items before</B>
<P><B>closing, myself and two others were sweeping the floors.  All the

other</B>
<P><B>employees were at the front of the store waiting for us to finish</B>
<P><B>sweeping.  We were all in completely separate areas of the store and</B>
<P><B>again, all the other employees were at the front.  We finished

sweeping</B>
<P><B>and came to the front.  The assist. manager thought we were fooling</B>
<P><B>around.  In one aisle only, there were boxes tossed around and

packages</B>
<P><B>opened and their contents strewn about.  I don't how it happened, but

no</B>
<P><B>one was around and there was not one sound made.  Especially

noticeable</B>
<P><B>were those rubber darts laying everywhere.  We never found any open</B>
<P><B>packages for them to go to.  The only other thing would have been for</B>
<P><B>someone to get a ladder and get into the "over stock" on top of the</B>
<P><B>regular aisles which was about 8 or more feet high, rip open these</B>
<P><B>packages and then put the ladder back without making any noise and

doing</B>
<P><B>it fast enough not to be seen.</B>

</H3><P><B>by jake42069@yahoo.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>For years I have felt the need to tell my story.  Keeping such an</B>
<P><B>experience is unbearable.</B>
<P>
<P><B>For years countless stories have been written about the famous</B>
<P><B>Winchester Mystery Housh in San Jose, California.  But never has
there</B>
<P><B>been a story printed of the haunting of the Century Theaters right</B>
<P><B>next door.</B>
<P>
<P><B>It was the first month of my new job at the theater so I felt pretty</B>
<P><B>comforatble being there.  I had heard my share of ghost stories from</B>
<P><B>my co-workers.  Being so close to the Winchester Mystery House how</B>
<P><B>could you avoid them.  When they told me that all three theaters were</B>
<P><B>haunted I blew it off as a joke.  I had seen what some of these guys</B>
<P><B>had done to newbies.  The jokes they played on them such as, counting</B>
<P><B>popcorn seeds, cleaning the parking lot, and drinking strange</B>
<P><B>concauctions.  I figured this was just another attempt at screwing</B>
<P><B>with me.  It turned out to be far from the truth.</B>
<P>
<P><B>As a new guy I was prone to getting the night shift.  This meant</B>
<P><B>closing up and cleaning up, usually by myself as most employees left</B>
<P><B>as early as they could.  One day as I was in the process of closing
I</B>
<P><B>had to take apart the soda machines as usual.  As I proceeded to</B>
<P><B>unassemble the machine on the right side of the counter I heard the</B>
<P><B>distinct swooshing of a soda machine behind me.  I turned around</B>
<P><B>expecting to see a customer trying to snatch a free drink but nobody</B>
<P><B>was there.  I return to my task at hand only to hear the swooshing</B>
<P><B>again.  This time when I turned around I could plainly see the
machine</B>
<P><B>was spewing soda by itself.  The strange thing was that they spewed
in</B>
<P><B>order.  Like from left to right.  You have to press firmly to make
any</B>
<P><B>soda come out so I sorta freaked.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>I had almost forgotten the first incident when one day I had to get</B>
<P><B>something from our stockroom.  You have to go behind the screen in
the</B>
<P><B>dark to the small room that contains all our stock.  When I went into</B>
<P><B>the room I turned on the light and got what I needed.  As I was about</B>
<P><B>to leave in turned off the light.  Suddenly, it turned back on.  I</B>
<P><B>turned it off and again it flipped back on.  Again, I freaked and
just</B>
<P><B>closed the door, light on, and ran back to the lobby.</B>
<P>
<P><B>As I continued to work there I experienced no more strange</B>
<P><B>experiences.  I made friends with all the managers and one day when
it</B>
<P><B>was slow I asked one of them about the story of the theater being</B>
<P><B>haunted.  He confirmed this with a fact that I was not aware about</B>
<P><B>before.  The Century Theaters were built on the Winchester property.
</B>
<P><B>To built them much of the property that was field, needed to be built</B>
<P><B>over.  Since the ghost of Sarah WInchester is said to still haunt her</B>
<P><B>house it seems fair that she haunt her whole property, theaters or
no</B>
<P><B>theaters.</B>

<H3><A NAME=mom>A Visit from Mom</A>
</H3><P><B>by lfeldner@mindspring.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>For those of you who have never experienced a visit from someone who
has been close to you,  trust me,  it ain't for sissies.  All the people
out there who don't believe there is an alternative plane of existance haven't
had to deal with it in their face.  I am a logical,  mentally balanced adult
professional who until recently did not think that "it could ever happen
to me".  All of that changed when my Mom passed away last year.  We were
quite close,  and her death was sudden and heartbreaking, but like everyone
else, life goes on.  My Mom was cremated and then came the question after
she died of who gets the urn... My older sister took the urn and after a
week told me "You come and get it,  the damn thing gives me the creeps!".
 I took the urn home and found a nice little corner to put "Mom" in, and
thought nothing of it; after all,  I didn't fear her in life,  why would
I fear her in death?</B>
<P><B>Since the urn has entered my house,  the room where "Mom" is placed
is ice cold,</B>
<P><B>standing around the urn, in front of the urn or in the doorway necessitates
a heavy sweater ( I might also like to add I live in Florida where it averages
80 degrees year round!).  In addition, the urn has been known to relocate
of its own volition,  one night at the foot of my bed while my husband and
I were sleeping.  How did we know it got there?  The covers on the bed were
yanked very hard off of us, and when I turned on the light,  there it was,
 scaring the wits out of me at the foot of the ol' Sealy posturpedic.  My
husband was sound asleep,  so I knew it wasn't him,  and I would have thought
a burglar would have better things to do. There is also another phenomena
-  my mother had a habit in life of always stockpiling dollar bills -  under
flowerpots,  in drawers,  in decorative boxes.  One day,  out of curiousity,
I peered inside the urn - there was ofcourse the usual big plastic bag of
ashes,  but more bizarre,  there was a single dollar bill inside!  I removed
the dollar bill, thinking my spouse was yanking my chain.  Not so,  he denied
the whole thing.  The following week I was dusting and peeked in again, 
and pulled out, you guessed it, another dollar bill.   My husband is not
the type to joke about this type of thing as he has lived with ghosts in
previous residences,  so I know it isn't him.  But it is sort of nice to
know that even in death,  Mom still thinks to leave me a dollar "just in
case".</B>

<H3><A NAME=my>My Many Experiences</A>
</H3><P><B>by JessRodman@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B> I am the only one in my famly who believes in ghosts. I have plenty
os</B>
<P><B>reasons to. Many of these experiences I have never spoken of to</B>
<P><B>anybody...until now. My friends and family wouldn't believe me if I
began to</B>
<P><B>tell them. Because I have so many different experiences with what I
believe</B>
<P><B>are ghosts, I think I am meant to know of them. I feel like I have
a</B>
<P><B>connection with the dead. All of this probally sounds pretty
unbelievable,</B>
<P><B>espacially coming from some one as young as I am but it all happened.
When I</B>
<P><B>was very young, like maybe three, I remember being watched. I remember
shadows</B>
<P><B>by the closet door. I think it was the shadow of a man. He watched
me every</B>
<P><B>night.  Usually he would just stand there. Once or twice he moved towards
me</B>
<P><B>and I ran into my parents room where they would let me stay. The
shadow</B>
<P><B>followed me into that room too, but I felt safe with my parents. For
the next</B>
<P><B>couple of years I don't really remember much. When I was five, I lived
on a</B>
<P><B>farm in Nebraska. It was a really Quiet area. I remember seeing a young
woman</B>
<P><B>(late teens/early twenties) running through the woods laughing and
gigling.</B>
<P><B>If any of my experiences were to be blamed on my imagination, it would
be this</B>
<P><B>one, though if it was only my imagination, I don't understand how it
appeared</B>
<P><B>in my memory with such vivid detail.</B>
<P><B>Later that year, I moved back to my home state, Virginia. Virginia
is a pretty</B>
<P><B>amazing state. It is one of the very first places people came to when
they</B>
<P><B>discovered america, and it is also full of historical sites from both
the</B>
<P><B>revolutionary and civil war. Many battlefields and cemetatires. Anyway,
when I</B>
<P><B>first moved back there, my mother, my brother and I were staying with
my</B>
<P><B>grandparents. Its a pretty old brick house. Before my grandparents
moved into</B>
<P><B>it, it was owned by my Great Aunt Clara. </B>
<P><B>Ever since the very frst time I stepped into my grandma&amp;grandpa's
bedroom, I</B>
<P><B>always get the chills. Even now I dread going in there alone. When
I was</B>
<P><B>younger, the eyes of the picture of Aunt Clara would follow me. They
would</B>
<P><B>follow me across the room. My brother has always been just as scared
of the</B>
<P><B>room as I have. He would never tell anybody why. To this day he refuses
to go</B>
<P><B>into the room. I remeber the scariest was when I was five, I was napping
on</B>
<P><B>grandma's bed and I was dreaming about great aunt Clara. All I remember
about</B>
<P><B>the dream was that she was </B>
<P><B>wearing all black and she was reaching out to me. I woke up sweating.
The room</B>
<P><B>was so dark but I made out her figure standing at the foot of the
bed,</B>
<P><B>reaching out to me like in the dream. I got up and ran out of the room
and</B>
<P><B>into the dinning room where I was pushed head first into the leg of
the large</B>
<P><B>solid dinning room table. I turned to see who had pushed me and nobody
was</B>
<P><B>there. I had to go to the emergency room for stitches in my forehead.
I never</B>
<P><B>told anybody about seeing her because nobody would have believed me.
Shortly</B>
<P><B>after, we moved. For another period  of time, nothing happened. A year
or two</B>
<P><B>later we moved again (I have moved 15 times in 15 years.) This time
we moved</B>
<P><B>to a small far from quiet neighborhood on the James river.  This house
we were</B>
<P><B>renting was pretty old, probably built at the turn of the cenuty. This
is</B>
<P><B>where the most real experience took place. I remember one day I was
walking up</B>
<P><B>the stairs to my bedroom door. I opened the bedroom door and a huge
snake fell</B>
<P><B>from above the above the door like some one placed it there. So it
dropped and</B>
<P><B>slithered towards me so fast and then it just dissapeared into the
floor</B>
<P><B>boards. This all happened to me in about two seconds. I ran down the
stairs</B>
<P><B>screaming. My family told me that that was the first time that they
had</B>
<P><B>actually heard me scream  before. After that I shared my brothers
bedroom.</B>
<P><B>After that we moved (again) to a house that we renovated. That house
is where</B>
<P><B>I first used the Ouija board and it worked. I played by myself mostly.
Once I</B>
<P><B>asked it  where my friend should move (her family had just been evicted)
and</B>
<P><B>it replied 613 Albermarle st.</B>
<P><B>At the time I was living at 615 Albermarle so I was extatic that she
would be</B>
<P><B>moving in next to me. That was when I realized that the only house
next door</B>
<P><B>to me was 617. It turned out that there was no 613. What was on that
side of</B>
<P><B>my house was just a lot that had recently been turned into a park.
These</B>
<P><B>friends ended up moving across the street from a huge park. I am just
now</B>
<P><B>making the connection. That house caught on fire when I was living
there and</B>
<P><B>burned down. So I moved again and one more time. When I first moved
there, I</B>
<P><B>hadn't heard the stories. It was built in the mid 1800's by the man
who lived</B>
<P><B>and died there. Some mighty strange things happened in this house.
The normal</B>
<P><B>haunting things would happen, hear footsteps upstairs when I was home
alone,</B>
<P><B>the stairs would creak at night when I was sure I was the only one
up, small</B>
<P><B>things would be moved around. Sometimes the electricity became
uncontrolable.</B>
<P><B>Very often my bed would shake at night. It wasn't like a violent shaking
but</B>
<P><B>it wasn't something that I could have imagined. There was always someone
in my</B>
<P><B>room with me. There was no time when I couldn't feel the presance.</B>
<P><B>My room was right above the living room where I later found out the
man had</B>
<P><B>died. I was left home alone all the time and I hated it. It drove me
crazy. We</B>
<P><B>had a dirt basement there and we used to dig in it to see if we could
find</B>
<P><B>anything. We did find plenty of liitle things that had once belonged
to these</B>
<P><B>people. The whole back half of the basement was solid dirt. On the
right of</B>
<P><B>the basement was a bricked off area  with a small hole in the wall
to the</B>
<P><B>basement. The hole was probably two feet by four feet and was at the
top of</B>
<P><B>the wall. I couldn't see into it but I was under the impression that
it was</B>
<P><B>full of dirt. I believe that there are secrets locked up in that basement
and</B>
<P><B>they are not to be messed with. I was liked in there once when I was
looking</B>
<P><B>around. The door shut on its own and it was jammed.  After living in
that</B>
<P><B>house, I moved to Minnesota. Since I have moved here, nothing has happened.
No</B>
<P><B>eerie happinings, nothing. And now I am starting to miss it. I believe
that</B>
<P><B>spirits have tried to conact me and I wasn't ready for what was going
on. Now</B>
<P><B>I am.</B>

</H3><P><B>by JetsonCard@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>       When I was ten years old I saw a real ghost. I was naturally
excited</B>
<P><B>and interested because I have always been interested in the subject.
I was</B>
<P><B>laying on my 60 year old grandpa's bed, when a young lady in white</B>
<P><B>appeared.She was so interesting because she was floating three inches
off the</B>
<P><B>ground! The lady floated over to my side.I noticed that she had no
face, no</B>
<P><B>hands and no features. She bent over and stared at me. At that time,
the most</B>
<P><B>exquisite feeling came over me.I did not feel even the least bit scared.
I</B>
<P><B>stared at her and she stared at me and after exactly 30 seconds, she
dissolved</B>
<P><B>right before my eyes! I never saw her again after that.    </B>

<H3><A NAME=living>Living with a Spirit</A>
</H3><P><B>by pengy0769@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>This is the first time I have ever felt as though I am living with
a ghost.  There has been no real evidence or sighting just "feeling".  As
I get into bed at night, I set my clock radio alarm for the morning.  Most
nights (not always) I can hear soft music playing.  Originally, I thought
my radio was broken and still playing but I've tried shutting it off and
could still hear the music.  I've even gone so far as to unplug it, still
the music is playing.  I thought I was going crazy, but my husband says he
hears it too.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Other things that happen in the house is cold spots and strange noises
and ever since we had our daughter, the spirit doesn't like me to shut my
bedroom door and will open it sometime during the night.  I figure it is
protecting my daughter.  The only other thing out of the ordinary is something
my husband witnessed.  The lights were off when my husband went in the bathroom,
he just happened to look in the mirror and saw the reflection of a man, he
seemed to be angry but he was not looking directly at my husband, just sorta
past him.  My husband didn't feel as though the man was mad at him, the anger
was toward someone else.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I'm not really afraid of this spirit.  I will admit I'm a bit spooked,
afterall, I've never lived with a spirit before!  I've never questioned my
landlord about the history of the house, he's just not the sort of person
to talk about things like that.</B>

<H3><A NAME=house>My Friends House</A>
</H3><P><B>by pollywog@chorus.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>When I was about 10, give or take a few years, I was sleeping over
at a</B>
<P><B>friend's house.  We were getting ready for bed, my friend was in her</B>
<P><B>bedroom, and I was walking up the stairs and went past her bedroom
to get to</B>
<P><B>the bathroom.</B>
<P>
<P><B>It was night, and dark outside, but her room was well lit. As I passed
her</B>
<P><B>door, out of the corner of my eye, I saw a woman with long brown braids
in</B>
<P><B>something that looked like a nightgown bending over something that
looked</B>
<P><B>like a crib.  I stopped and said something like "who's in there with
you?"</B>
<P><B>to my friend.  She said no one was there.  I went back and looked,
and there</B>
<P><B>was nothing there.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I don't know how important this is, but:  If you stood in the door
of her</B>
<P><B>bedroom, there were two large windows directly ahead which faced the
road,</B>
<P><B>and at the far end of the left wall by the windows was a door into
a large</B>
<P><B>closet that had its own window.  Along the window wall near the closet
 I</B>
<P><B>think there was something like a low shelf or table.  The crib I saw
was</B>
<P><B>standing right up against the closet door in that same place, and it
would</B>
<P><B>have been an odd place to put a crib.  On the right side of the room
by the</B>
<P><B>windows there was a sort of large nook where my friend had her bed,
and a</B>
<P><B>door in the wall of the nook opposite the wall with the windows opened
onto</B>
<P><B>the staircase to the attic.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I think I told my friend what I had seen; she was a nervous type
about</B>
<P><B>things like that, and if I did tell her she probably got mad at me
for</B>
<P><B>scaring her, but I don't remember for sure.</B>
<P>
<P><B>That's one of the weird things about these kinds of experiences --
I</B>
<P><B>remember most of it in extreme detail, but I can't remember things
that</B>
<P><B>happened immediately after.</B>
<P>
<P><B>To keep my peace of mind, I always assume there is some kind of
reasonable</B>
<P><B>explanation for these kinds of things; for example, vision out of the
corner</B>
<P><B>of the eye is not good.  Nothing has happened to me personally in many
many</B>
<P><B>years now.  I am intrigued by other people's experience, and fearful
at the</B>
<P><B>same time.</B>

<H3><A NAME=haunted>Is My Apartment Haunted?</A>
</H3><P><B>by MaryBeth7G@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>I have lived in this apt. since I was 6 years old.  All my life strange
things</B>
<P><B>have happened here.  Not necessarily scary things, more like
unexplainable</B>
<P><B>things.  When I was a child my mom would have me sleep in her bed when
I</B>
<P><B>wasn't well because it was closer to the kitchen where she would spend
her</B>
<P><B>time.  I absolutely hated when she would close the door.  I would
immediately</B>
<P><B>be sent into a state of panic if the door was closed.  I would cry
and beg her</B>
<P><B>to open it.  I didn't feel this way anywhere else.  Once when I was
about 12</B>
<P><B>or so, I was lying on my mom's bed to take a nap just as the sun seemed
to be</B>
<P><B>setting.  My mom closed the door and I was uncomfortable but thought
hey I am</B>
<P><B>a big girl now, it's silly to be afraid of nothing.  About 20-30
minutes</B>
<P><B>later, I felt someone sit on the bed and I could feel the bed moving
up and</B>
<P><B>down like someone was breathing.  I held my own breath to make sure
it wasn't</B>
<P><B>me.   It wasn't me - I began calling my mom because I didn't want to
move off</B>
<P><B>the bed, that is how scared I was!!!  When she opened the door, I ran
out of</B>
<P><B>there in an instant!!!  I never told her what happened and the funny
thing is</B>
<P><B>she never asked. When I was 18, my mom and I were sitting in the
livingroom</B>
<P><B>when we heard the bathroom door close, we thought my dad had gotten
out of bed</B>
<P><B>and gone in there.  Some time had passed and my mom decided to see
if he was</B>
<P><B>ok since he'd been in there a long time.  She knocked and when she
got no</B>
<P><B>answer she went in and no one was there, the light wasn't even on but
the door</B>
<P><B>had been completely closed which would have to have been done by a
person as</B>
<P><B>there is no window in the bathroom or near the bathroom and the door
needs a</B>
<P><B>good push to close.  About a week earlier, I was in the bathroom washing
my</B>
<P><B>face and I was suddenly overcome with a panic to get out of the bathroom
as</B>
<P><B>fast as I could, when I did get out, I felt out of breath and my heart
was</B>
<P><B>racing, I don't know if there is  a connection, but that never happened
before</B>
<P><B>or since.  My mom died a few weeks later.  There are many strange and</B>
<P><B>unexplainable things that happen here.  I am not going to tell the
whole story</B>
<P><B>of each because they are long but I will list the details:</B>
<P>
<P><B>One night while reading a book, my VCR turned on, adjusted like it
was going</B>
<P><B>to start playing a tape and then turned itself off.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Until I completely unplugged this radio (which is still in my apt),
it would</B>
<P><B>turn on at different times at top volume when no one was even in the
room!</B>
<P>
<P><B>I replace lightbulbs in the bathroom and bedroom (I now sleep in my
mom's old</B>
<P><B>room which is next to the bathroom) more often than any room in the
house, at</B>
<P><B>least once a month I am replacing them and they seem to blow at the
same time</B>
<P><B>in both rooms if not on the same day, a day or 2 later.  Yet, I can't
even</B>
<P><B>remember the last time I changed the lightbulb in the kitchen (which
is also</B>
<P><B>next to the bedroom).</B>
<P>
<P><B>At times the toilet flushes by itself.  Sometimes it will be a
continuous</B>
<P><B>flush like someone is holding down the handle, I have had it checked
and a</B>
<P><B>part was replaced but it still happens - it also seems to leak at times
but</B>
<P><B>then will just stop altogether.</B>
<P>
<P><B>You hear a knocking in the walls.  Walls that don't lead to anyone
elses apt</B>
<P><B>but to another room which is unoccupied - if you ignore it it will
grow</B>
<P><B>steadily louder, if you say, Alright already I hear you now stop, it
stops (My</B>
<P><B>mom used to do this which is where I got the idea, until then it would
drive</B>
<P><B>me crazy)</B>
<P>
<P><B>I left my computer on and left for the day, when I returned, the document
I</B>
<P><B>left open had a series of L's all down the page that went on for 4
or 5 pages,</B>
<P><B>just that one letter over and over, my boyfriend at the time was convinced
I</B>
<P><B>was cheating on him and that was how the letters appeared there, you
know</B>
<P><B>someone had been there while we were gone.</B>
<P>
<P><B>My boyfriend at the time was abusive toward me and he would show me
very light</B>
<P><B>superficial scratches on his arms or legs that he couldn't explain
(I don't</B>
<P><B>know if this is connected, but someone told me jokingly that "my ghost"
didn't</B>
<P><B>like him)</B>
<P>
<P><B>I put things down and later when I go to get it (usually something
small but</B>
<P><B>important,  like keys or jewelry or money)  it's not there I will tear
the</B>
<P><B>place apart trying to find it and just when I am about to give up it
reappears</B>
<P><B>in the original place I left it.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Most recently, I was sleeping (in my mom's room) when I was awoken
by my dog.</B>
<P><B>She was growling, very low like she was unsure if there was a threat,
and I</B>
<P><B>turned to her and saw a figure who appeared to be standing 2 feet off
the</B>
<P><B>floor right next to my bed.  He was looking at me and I saw the expression
as</B>
<P><B>one of confusion or curiosity.  My first reaction was to say who the
hell are</B>
<P><B>you? and then my dog started barking and I looked at the clock to see
the</B>
<P><B>time, when I turned back it was gone.  I wasn't afraid though, I was
more</B>
<P><B>startled.  I thought I must have still been dreaming and went back
to sleep,</B>
<P><B>for days the image bothered me,  I called my dad and asked him if
anything</B>
<P><B>strange ever happened to him when he lived here and he said you mean
near the</B>
<P><B>bathroom or in the bedroom?  and when i said yes he laughingly said,
no.  Then</B>
<P><B>he told me that he would see things out of the corner of his eye but
when he</B>
<P><B>looked it was gone, he refused to talk more about it.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Wow, I have gone on and on and there is still so much more to tell,
but I</B>
<P><B>think this should be enough for you to be able to tell me what I might
be</B>
<P><B>dealing with.  I am 28 now and have lived here for 22 years, I don't
feel</B>
<P><B>whatever it is, is dangerous  but I sometimes feel that I am going
out of my</B>
<P><B>mind.</B>

<P>
<P><B>Odd things have always happened my family. as a child i was raised
by my</B>
<P><B>grandparents.on the havasupai reservation.</B>
<P><B>there was no question to there being spirtis on our reservation. my</B>
<P><B>gandfather came from a long line of medicine men.</B>
<P><B>although he doesn't practice medicine.he says he remembers everything
he</B>
<P><B>witnessed while he was learning to pracitce.</B>
<P><B>somethings sacred him to death and somethings he says are comforting.</B>
<P>
<P><B>he says it was a practice of good vs evil. some cermonies were so
intense</B>
<P><B>that they were physicially attacked by appirations.</B>
<P><B>large,small, white, some times, gray or black images. he says the
spirits</B>
<P><B>are present all the time. as if  waiting for the right moment to strike.
he</B>
<P><B>always said if i was harmed in any way i shouldn't point blame to anyone
or</B>
<P><B>anything. he said to express in words"YOU ARENT GETTING THE BEST OFME"
just</B>
<P><B>loud enough for me to hear it. even when whispered,it was a means of</B>
<P><B>protection.</B>
<P>
<P><B>he said sometimes late at night,family members that have passed away
would</B>
<P><B>come knocking at his window.mostly his brother.he said he knew when
it was</B>
<P><B>his brother,and when it wasn't. his brother gave him a sense of happiness
or</B>
<P><B>protection.</B>
<P><B>but the others came with evil intentions. he says that all encounters
are</B>
<P><B>warnings and signs of bad thing that are about to happen.or when
sickness</B>
<P><B>was to fall on members of our family. he said he knew when the evil
ones</B>
<P><B>were around. when they came to his window.he would feel a cold breez,then
a</B>
<P><B>strong sense of fright.chills would overwhelm his body.and then a
split</B>
<P><B>second before he saw or heard anything.he would be
paralizied.completely</B>
<P><B>taken over.the chills got worse and when he would try yelling nothing
would</B>
<P><B>come out.sometimes he said he felt like he was dieing and feeling every
bit</B>
<P><B>of it.of course this only time this happened was, when it was pitch
black in</B>
<P><B>his room.sometimes they reached in for him, from outside his window
or from</B>
<P><B>right underneath his bed.he said it wasn't the same feel of someone
grabing</B>
<P><B>you physically. their grasp pierced right through to the bone.much
like a</B>
<P><B>snake wraping tightly around you.only every bit of the inside would
also</B>
<P><B>feel constricted.right down to the bone.</B>
<P>
<P><B>we always had traditional singing gourds hung up around the house.
these</B>
<P><B>were used for funneral wakes.almost every time</B>
<P><B>a force was present it was thru a dead family member. even if it was
just a</B>
<P><B>dark shadow.the dead were used as  portals to reach the lively hood
of our</B>
<P><B>people. he said the gourd served as a warning system. if a force entered
our</B>
<P><B>house the gourds would rattle like crazy.much like an alarm system</B>
<P><B>protecting the house from thieft.he said this would cause the dead
to return</B>
<P><B>to the resting place.it was a reminder that the person was dead, and
that he</B>
<P><B>was only causing distress. the evil using it had no way of envading
or</B>
<P><B>entering our house. if the force was strong enough.the gourds would
not</B>
<P><B>work.he said if that happened </B>
<P><B>we would all experience cold chills and a sense of fright. he said
you'd</B>
<P><B>feel so scared you wouldn't want to move.and that if you didn't
convince</B>
<P><B>yourself to move it would only get worse.and that one person would
be taken</B>
<P><B>as an outlet for the family.</B>
<P><B>sickness and or death would fall that person.</B>
<P>
<P><B>to this day i have never seen or experience anything of that nature..
but</B>
<P><B>deep down inside it know it's all to true..</B>
<P><B>ive heard the gourds go off. but never felt anything. my grandfather
says</B>
<P><B>they still visit him. i love my grandfather for everthing he has shared
with</B>
<P><B>me.he says that all of this is only fair warning, and that this happens
to</B>
<P><B>everyone. some just don't notice.</B>
<P><B>the next time you fall or get in a fight just thnik "who is realy behind
it</B>
<P><B>all."i could go on and on but i'd best stop here.</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>there is a  reason behind everything that happens. i was asked not
to tell</B>

<H3> <A NAME=a>Living in a Haunted House</A>
</H3><P><B>by H2OMyers@webtv.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>When I was about 3 years old, my family moved into a house that was</B>
<P><B>haunted.  Of course, my parents tried to hide the fact from me.  I
think</B>
<P><B>I just knew.</B>
<P>
<P><B>We would here all kinds of noises.  People walking up and down the</B>
<P><B>staircases, loud thumps, glass breaking, etc.  Everyday at noon,
there</B>
<P><B>would be someone walking on the front staircase and up the attic
stairs.</B>
<P><B>My father would hear it on his lunch hour.  Everyday, he would yell
at</B>
<P><B>Hippolite (on of the brothers that built the house in 1903).  And,
then</B>
<P><B>it would stop.</B>
<P>
<P><B>We lived right down the street from a catholic church.  My parents
had</B>
<P><B>become friends with a few of the sisters at the church.  One day, as
my</B>
<P><B>parents were working in the yard, and my sister and I played outside,</B>
<P><B>one of the sisters stopped by.  She asked my father how his mother
was.</B>
<P><B>He told her fine, that he had just visited with her that morning at
her</B>
<P><B>house.  Then she asked my mother how her mother was.  My mother</B>
<P><B>explained that her mother had passed away quite awhile ago, but as
far</B>
<P><B>as she knew, her step-mother was ok.  She then asked about the older</B>
<P><B>woman who lived with us. my parents told her that we didn't have an</B>
<P><B>older woman living with us.  She said "Yes you do.  I wave to her</B>
<P><B>everyday when I am on my walk.  She sits in that window (and pointed
to</B>
<P><B>my bedroom window) and just smiles and waves to me."</B>
<P>
<P><B>My parents did some research and found that the brothers that had
built</B>
<P><B>the house had an elderly housekeeper.  Her quarters were on the third</B>
<P><B>floor (where my dad's office was).  I guess she had died in the house.
 </B>
<P>
<P><B>On one occasion, when my Mom was in the office typing, she heard
someone</B>
<P><B>walking around the attic.  She of course yelled for my Dad.  He came
up</B>
<P><B>and checked the whole attic (which was huge).  He found no one.  As
soon</B>
<P><B>as he got back downstairs, my Mom starting screaming.  My Dad ran
back</B>
<P><B>upstairs.  She had heard the footsteps again.  So, he checked it out</B>
<P><B>again, and found no one.</B>
<P>
<P><B>When I was about 4 or 5, I had a little toy clock.  It played Hickory</B>
<P><B>Dickory Dock, and it had a little set of clock hands that clicked
when</B>
<P><B>you turned the knob.  Anyhow, when I was trying to get to sleep one</B>
<P><B>night, the hands starting clicking (it was right beside me, so I knew
I</B>
<P><B>wasn't imagining it).  I was too terrified to scream for my parents.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I used to keep all of my Barbie dolls and their clothes in a plastic</B>
<P><B>case on the floor at the foot of my bed.  One night I heard someone</B>
<P><B>stepping on it.  Again, too terrified to call for my parents.</B>
<P>
<P><B>We had problems when ouja boards were taken into the house too.  The</B>
<P><B>first time, my sister took it in.  That evening, my Dad had asked my</B>
<P><B>sister to take all of the newspapers down to the back porch (they had</B>
<P><B>been in the upstairs hallway).  She did.  That night, my sister woke
up</B>
<P><B>and heard someone going down the attic stairs, open and close the
door.</B>
<P><B>Go down the front staircase, and come up the back staircase, open and</B>
<P><B>close the attic door, and go up the stairs.  A few minutes later, she</B>
<P><B>heard the exact same thing.  The next day, when my Dad went home for</B>
<P><B>lunch, he walked in to here doors slamming, bells ringing, and voices</B>
<P><B>(to this day, no one knows what the voices were saying, my Dad
wouldn't</B>
<P><B>tell any one).  He went upstairs and found all the newspapers that
my</B>
<P><B>sister had taken to the backporch, scattered all through the
upstairs.</B>
<P><B>There were no windows open or nothing that would create a breeze. 
My</B>
<P><B>Dad saw the ouja board and set it on the front porch, and immediately</B>
<P><B>everything stopped.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Another time there was a ouja board in the house, my aunt was
visiting.</B>
<P><B>She decided to sleep on the couch in the family room.  She woke up</B>
<P><B>during the night and saw an orange glow coming from the living room</B>
<P><B>(where the ouja board was).  For about two weeks after that, the cats</B>
<P><B>wouldn't go into the living room.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The cats would sit at the bottom of the front staircase just staring
up.</B>
<P><B>Then they would take off and rip and tare through the house.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>Through the years, it gradually calmed down.  The house has recently</B>
<P><B>been sold.  I have heard that the new owners are going to turn it into
a</B>
<P><B>deli and sandwich shop (which is a shame, it's a beautiful house).
 I</B>
<P><B>just have a feeling that things will stir up again for them.  I don't</B>
<P><B>know too much about ghosts (I fully believe in them and I am
fascinated</B>
<P><B>by real life ghost stories) but I think that when that house is</B>
<P><B>disturbed, by new owners, the ghosts aren't happy about it (or they
want</B>
<P><B>people to know they are there).  I think they get used to the people</B>
<P><B>after a while and start to settle down.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Well, that's my true ghost story.  Thank you for enabling me to share
it</B>
<P><B>with you.  I love to share it with people, but most of the time, I
just</B>
<P><B>get weird looks.</B>

<H3><A NAME=farmhouse>The Farmhouse</A>
</H3><P><B>by HIPPIECHICK26@webtv.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>I now live in Indiana and a few years ago my husband and I rented a
little farmhouse.</B>
<P><B>Our landlord lived right behind us and the farmhouse used to belong
to</B>
<P><B>his grandparents now both deceased. Not long after we moved in we
began</B>
<P><B>to hear things and my 2 year old daughter would wake up in fear
crying</B>
<P><B>about a man in her room. I would say "Where?" and she would point to
a</B>
<P><B>corner of the room but I would see nothing. We would often hear</B>
<P><B>footsteps coming up the basement stairs with no one there this
happening</B>
<P><B>in front of other witnesses also. We would sometimes hear a man in
the</B>
<P><B>basement talking but couldn't make out what he was saying. My husband</B>
<P><B>would always look outside thinking someone was out there talking but
no</B>
<P><B>one ever was. Now the basement was a creepy place where I always
sensed</B>
<P><B>being watched and followed. There was a lttle room that used to hold</B>
<P><B>well water with a heavy door that had the window painted white. I
felt</B>
<P><B>this room was evil and I hated it. Unfortunately my washer and dryer</B>
<P><B>were down in the basement so I had to go there often. For a long time</B>
<P><B>the ghost just made noises not meant to scare just moving about the</B>
<P><B>house. Later he would come into our bedroom at night. I never
realized</B>
<P><B>it until i saw your site and David and Sherry's site but he came in
the</B>
<P><B>room alot more than the 2 times I saw him in human form. I would
either</B>
<P><B>be asleep or almost asleep and I would see a ball of light drift
slowly</B>
<P><B>into the room. It would move sometimes to the side in front of my
closet</B>
<P><B>or to my horror it would come right at me and hover right above me.
I</B>
<P><B>didn't realize then that the orb was the ghost. I thought I was
dreaming</B>
<P><B>a weird weird dream that seemed I was awake because I saw the room</B>
<P><B>exactly like I was awake.(Appartently because I was awake.) I would
be</B>
<P><B>half asleep and angry at myself for having such terrifying visions
so I</B>
<P><B>would angrily think in my mind"Get out of here. Stop!!" and it would</B>
<P><B>disappear. Twice after that I woke up to see a 30-40 year old man
with</B>
<P><B>dark hair and a red and black lumberjack shirt staring at mefrom
beside</B>
<P><B>my bed Oddly I was so tired I just rolled over and went back to sleep.
I</B>
<P><B>found out later from my friend who used to live next door to the
house</B>
<P><B>that my lanlord's  grandfather had died in the house.(His name was</B>
<P><B>Pete). Also he had been a grumpy old man .Funny thing was that both</B>
<P><B>times I saw him he was a younger man. Anyways he never really
bothered</B>
<P><B>us so we had no problems living there with him. We only moved out</B>
<P><B>because we bought a new home this past year.To this day I still can't</B>
<P><B>believe I calmly co-habitated with a ghost.</B>

<H3><A NAME=in>The House in Detroit</A>
</H3><P><B>by  Mrsgrif@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>Hi my name is Diane </B>
<P><B>Growing up in Detroit, my family lived in a house that was haunted,
on several</B>
<P><B>occasions my whole family would hear loud crashes that could only be
described</B>
<P><B>as boxes of dishes being smashed.  Everyone in my family experienced
several</B>
<P><B>ghost contacts in one form or another.  One three different occasions
with</B>
<P><B>three different family members, a man about sixty was seen wearing
a plaid</B>
<P><B>flannel shirt.  This man mealy stood there looking at the person,
never</B>
<P><B>attempting communication or harm.  I was about eight when he appeared
and I</B>
<P><B>was the first one to see him, although my sister who was seven years
older</B>
<P><B>than me was not present.  I tell this to you now so later you will
understand.</B>
<P><B>My relatives from out of town were visiting and the adults were sitting
in the</B>
<P><B>living room after dinner, I was extremely quite in the hopes that only
a child</B>
<P><B>can have that they would forget that I was there.  I was sitting on
the couch</B>
<P><B>and the front door was open, with the screen door closed.  I saw the
man</B>
<P><B>wearing a red plaid shirt standing at the front door looking in.  I
told my</B>
<P><B>family and they though I over tired, and put me to bed.  Later that
same week</B>
<P><B>my older sister was getting into the shower when she saw a man in a
red plaid</B>
<P><B>shirt standing in the bathroom with her, she freaked out and told my
mother</B>
<P><B>who this time listened more closely.  She then revealed that she too
had seen</B>
<P><B>the man in the red shirt standing in the kitchen by the sink, looking
like he</B>
<P><B>was getting a glass of water.  All family members routinely heard
footsteps</B>
<P><B>throughout the house especially going up stairs into an attic bedroom.
 The</B>
<P><B>steps would continue across the floor.  All family members experienced
this</B>
<P><B>together and separate on several different occasions.  My sister who's
bedroom</B>
<P><B>it was for a while admitted she was scared to sleep in that room and
was</B>
<P><B>frightened very often thinking that someone was coming into her room.
 I later</B>
<P><B>had that same bedroom and became so afraid of it that I began sleeping
on the</B>
<P><B>living room sofa.  On several occasions dishes in that house would
break when</B>
<P><B>put in a certain china cabinet, and on two separate occasions a silver
meat</B>
<P><B>platter in the china cabinet, whose doors were kept closed, flew across
the</B>
<P><B>room at my mother.  Lights turned off in the basement, would be on
when we</B>
<P><B>woke up EVERY morning.  The dryer would routinely come on by it self
and even</B>
<P><B>after the electric was checked out this still continued.  The basement
had an</B>
<P><B>old coal room that had been converted into a storage room with paint
cans and</B>
<P><B>stuff, this room had a negative feeling and NO ONE in the family liked
to even</B>
<P><B>go in there.  Likewise, no one in the family wanted to go under the
stairs</B>
<P><B>although no one ever had a mysterious occurrence in those places.
 Every</B>
<P><B>family member in that house had heard their name called on different
occasions</B>
<P><B>many times when they were home alone.  One occasion comes to mind,
my father</B>
<P><B>who was home alone was working in the basement, my mother sister and
I were</B>
<P><B>out shopping at the mall.  He distinctly heard the front door open,
even</B>
<P><B>though it was locked and someone walk across the living room and kitchen.
 He</B>
<P><B>went upstairs and found the front door locked as he knew he would.
 It was</B>
<P><B>then that someone called his name.  He answered and no one said anything
after</B>
<P><B>that. </B>
<P><B>Another all family experience came when we all went to visit my grand
mother</B>
<P><B>who lived across town, we even brought the family dog.  We were returning
home</B>
<P><B>and as we pulled in the drive way, I saw the drapes move back like
someone was</B>
<P><B>watching us return.  I said did you see that, my father countered what
did you</B>
<P><B>see?  I told him and he and my mother and sister agreed that that is
what they</B>
<P><B>saw too.  My dad went in to the house first why we waited in the car.</B>
<P><B>Everything was just as we left it with the doors locked.  On one occasion
I</B>
<P><B>awoke to having a woman standing at the foot of my bed, she disappeared
as</B>
<P><B>soon as I got a good look at her.  Her name was Anne she said and she
had</B>
<P><B>lived in that house.  No one in that house ever saw Anne again.  This
house</B>
<P><B>had an addition that was a formal dinning room off the back.  It had
built in</B>
<P><B>china cabinets that would fly open on no occasion, even after my mother
put</B>
<P><B>hooks on them, thinking the wood was swelling.  Music was often heard
playing</B>
<P><B>softly, and tinny like a bad am transistor.  In all it was a weird
place to</B>
<P><B>live and we were all very glad to move, but we did live there over
twenty</B>
<P><B>years.</B>
<P>
<P><B>My parents moved into an apartment, as I did in a different location,
while</B>
<P><B>staying with them because I had become extremely ill.  I had a unique</B>
<P><B>experience of a ghost nurse who took care of me.  My parents were asleep
and I</B>
<P><B>was lying on the sofa, so hot, but lucid.  I could hear them snoring
from the</B>
<P><B>bedroom.  I heard soft slippers shuffle across the floor and felt a
cold hand</B>
<P><B>lovingly touch my forehead checking my fever, a comfort, I was not
afraid</B>
<P><B>really and somehow thought Grandma is here but I had no evidence of
this.  I</B>
<P><B>remember keeping my eyes closed, just knowing my nurse did not want
me to see</B>
<P><B>her.  I was very conscious of my parents snoring and knew it was not
them.</B>
<P><B>When the feet shuffled off I opened my eyes and got up looked at my
parents,</B>
<P><B>they were sound asleep.  The whole situation lasted maybe two minutes,
yet I</B>
<P><B>started to improve that night. </B>

<H3><A NAME=andrew>Andrew</A>
</H3><P><B>by webbcass@ctarng-mail.ngb.army.mil</B>
<P>
<P><B>I have been reading stories on this page for over a year, now.  Why
- I</B>
<P><B>don't know - I always find myself scared at night - but I until look
forward</B>
<P><B>to the new entries every month.  I thought it might be time to submit
my</B>
<P><B>scariest, I am very sensitive to the spiritual world, so I have many.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Okay, a few years ago, I met my current husband, Joe, during the
beginning</B>
<P><B>stages of his nasty divorce to his wife, Jennifer.  Jennifer was raised
in</B>
<P><B>Jewish family that had a lot of problems.  Before they married, they
lived</B>
<P><B>in the downstairs apartment of Joe's father's house.  His sister and
her</B>
<P><B>family lived upstairs.  They had experience some ghost activity when
they</B>
<P><B>were children there, but it was all positive, like smelling roses
throughout</B>
<P><B>the house.  Jennifer's brother, Andrew had joined a Devil Worshipping
Cult</B>
<P><B>and moved to California.  Eventually, he realized it was crazy and
sick so</B>
<P><B>he hopped on a bus and journeyed home to Massachusetts.  At every stop,
one</B>
<P><B>of the members was standing outside the bus just staring at him.  He
made it</B>
<P><B>home, but did not escape.  They came to him at night, played head games,
and</B>
<P><B>did not allow him to let go of the devil.  He was also very heavy
into</B>
<P><B>drugs.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Joe was, and still is, a member of AA, so he invited Andrew to live
with</B>
<P><B>them while he tried to recover and get off the drugs.  Andrew could
not, and</B>
<P><B>one day said, "I just want to live to see you two get married".  A
few weeks</B>
<P><B>after their wedding, Andrew was found hanging from a tree in a nearby
park.</B>
<P>
<P><B>After the funeral, Joe was consoling Jennifer when he heard 3 knocks
on the</B>
<P><B>door.  He went to answer it but no one was there.  All of a sudden
a rush of</B>
<P><B>energy entered his body, and then everything went black.  Joe awoke
to his</B>
<P><B>brother-in-law holding him down and trying to stop him from convulsing.
 He</B>
<P><B>had come downstairs to find out what the knocks were from.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Joe and Jennifer got Andrew's wonderful leather living room set.  They
moved</B>
<P><B>to CT and split up shortly thereafter.  I came along pretty quickly
and also</B>
<P><B>got pregnant pretty quickly.  So we were not allowed to see the family
for</B>
<P><B>they were ashamed of Joe's actions.</B>
<P>
<P><B>One night, I had a nightmare of being chased by an evil and angry
spirit</B>
<P><B>through a house I had never seen before.  I was flying from room to
room, up</B>
<P><B>many stairs.  Finally, I went into a room where there was a child spirit
on</B>
<P><B>a bed and very scared.  I remember holding it while watching the spirit
fly</B>
<P><B>up the stairs at us.  Then I awoke.  I told Joe about this one because
it</B>
<P><B>was so vivid.  He just about died, I described every room down to the
wall</B>
<P><B>paper of his father's house that his sister still lives in.  We were
invited</B>
<P><B>over shortly after.  His family began to forgive him and understand
his</B>
<P><B>reasoning, not to mention they had a beautiful niece/grand-daughter
that</B>
<P><B>they did not know.  When I walked in, I knew I had been there before.</B>
<P><B>Aimee, Joe's 7 year old niece, said,  "I knew you had blonde hair,
I had a</B>
<P><B>dream about you last week!".  Strange.</B>
<P>
<P><B>A year later.  I went to a psychic who I had never met before.  She
told me</B>
<P><B>a lot of stuff about my guides an messages from them.  Well, one was
this,</B>
<P><B>"That spirit that was chasing you, it is a sibling of your
boyfriend's</B>
<P><B>x-lover.".  And that was it!</B>
<P>
<P><B>We just finally sold that damn leather furniture.  I hope Andrew leaves
me</B>
<P><B>alone, now.</B>

<P>
<P><B>i hadnt never thought of finding someone to speak to on the web about</B>
<P><B>the situation we have here at our house..but here goes:</B>
<P><B>my gf and i moved into this rental in ga here two years ago..we had
to</B>
<P><B>do alot of remodleing on the house to get it livable..it had prior
been</B>
<P><B>decorated by two gay men who had died of aids..just not our taste and
in</B>
<P><B>dire need of a makeover...well anyways in the process of painting,</B>
<P><B>tearing down partitions ect we noticed strange things happening..such
as</B>
<P><B>pictures being knocked off of shevles,door slamming sounds when the
door</B>
<P><B>was locked..mumbled talking conversations early in the am from the</B>
<P><B>living room..keys rattling..ect...we tried to ignore it but we both</B>
<P><B>thought we had some presence in the house..not long after this began
our</B>
<P><B>neighbor an elderly lady spoke to us about the prior tenant having
seen</B>
<P><B>one of the gay men(she had knew both the deceased)on the train after</B>
<P><B>they had both died..this frightened her and she had told the neighbor</B>
<P><B>after she had moved out..(we hadnt mentioned any of the behavior or
are</B>
<P><B>concerns to the neighbor before her bringing this up)then thur a
friend</B>
<P><B>of the landlord of a business the neighbor owned the neighbor asked
me</B>
<P><B>if i lived in the house on pineland..i said yes..he then asked me if
i</B>
<P><B>knew the story on the house..i said no...is there a story??he then</B>
<P><B>proceeded to tell me about the orig owner whom had been murdered by
his</B>
<P><B>girlfreind in the house(appartently it was never proved to be a
murder,</B>
<P><B>only suspiscous circumstances)and that the rumor had it that the orig</B>
<P><B>owner had buried some gold coins in the house since they had never
been</B>
<P><B>recovered..so with this information i told my gf what he had told me,</B>
<P><B>this got her curiousity up and she started looking for it ..in the
attic</B>
<P><B>under boards, under the house, ect..then we really had problems..the</B>
<P><B>activity in the house really increased.our cat really noticed seeing</B>
<P><B>things with her hair bristled and eyes big following movement in the</B>
<P><B>corners of the rooms..things started being knocked off shelves,
strange</B>
<P><B>loud noises ect..so i immediately told my gf to stop searching for
the</B>
<P><B>gold...she did..she was frightened too...then a lull began concerning</B>
<P><B>the activity...untill we started again tearing out the kitchen for
a new</B>
<P><B>stove...it got so bad one day hearing keys rattling and noises i had
to</B>
<P><B>call her at work to come home i was so frightened..it has seemed to
calm</B>
<P><B>down a bit now ..when i do hear there tricks starting up again i
calmly</B>
<P><B>ask them to stop...and they seem to respond..well anyway this is our</B>
<P><B>story, we dont really like having these uncomfortable feelings but</B>
<P><B>hopefully we can live with them..thankyou for your time</B>

<H3><A NAME=apartment>My Apartment</A>
</H3><P><B>by MCha396441@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>I recently moved from an apartment that I had lived in for ten years.
 Shorly</B>
<P><B>after I moved in, I had a three year old child tell me there was an
old man at</B>
<P><B>the end of the hallway by my bedroom.  Just prior to that, my
daughter</B>
<P><B>occupied that bedroom and refused to sleep in it.  After i changed
bedrroms, i</B>
<P><B>had several experiences for which i had no logical explanation.  Upon
waking</B>
<P><B>one night to go to work, i had rolled over to hit the snooze button
on my</B>
<P><B>alarm and felt someone or something sit on my bed.  I didn't turn around
to</B>
<P><B>look-but I know i was wide awake and not dreaming.  On another night
as I was</B>
<P><B>leaving for work (at 10:30 p.m.) I had walked out of the apartment
and shut</B>
<P><B>the door.  I realized I had forgot something and when I reopened the
door I</B>
<P><B>seen a yellow-orange sphere of light in the hallway and it shot into
the front</B>
<P><B>bedroom (my daughter's room).  I had also would see dark figures go
into my</B>
<P><B>bedroom while i would be in the bathroom which was next to my
bedroom.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I had watched small children in my home look at something that wasn't
there</B>
<P><B>and had other people afraid to stay in my apartment because they felt
someone</B>
<P><B>looking at them.  I took quite some time for me to not feel ill at
ease but I</B>
<P><B>never felt that I was in danger.  Since moving to my house, i have
felt no</B>
<P><B>presences around me or in my home.  I had heard that ghosts can
sometime</B>
<P><B>follow people but I don't feel that this has happened in this case.</B>

<H3><A NAME=funny>Just a Funny Feeling</A>
</H3><P><B>by ronbevault@prodigy.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>I don't really know how to start this. I am the only one that this</B>
<P><B>happened to, that I know of.  About 10 years ago, my brother in law,
was</B>
<P><B>looking for a house to by, as an investment, and a home.  He asked
my</B>
<P><B>husband and I to come and look, an give an opinion of the house.</B>
<P>
<P><B>As we looked through the house, it seemed cheery and bright, the
living</B>
<P><B>room was large with a nice fireplace.  Everyone else walked to the
back</B>
<P><B>of the house, to the bedrooms.  I  went to the kitchen, thinking
 Gina,</B>
<P><B>my brother in laws girlfriend would be there.  She was not. I went
to</B>
<P><B>the garage door, and stepped out.  The garage was not too cold or hot,
I</B>
<P><B>don't remember feeling anything like that.  I looked at the large
door</B>
<P><B>for the car to come through, and saw were kids had spray painted a
four</B>
<P><B>lettered word.  I  began to have a strong sense of anxiety, at that</B>
<P><B>time, as I walked closer to the door, my heart seemed to beat faster
and</B>
<P><B>harder, kind of like I had been running very fast,  I turned around
to</B>
<P><B>go to the back door, it was padlocked on the inside, no key.  I felt</B>
<P><B>like I could hear screaming in my head, for a second, I thought I</B>
<P><B>screamed too, but I didn't.</B>
<P><B>I felt my throat closing, and like I would  stop breathing    I left
the</B>
<P><B>garage,quickly after that, and joined the others inside. driving home
I</B>
<P><B>told my husband how I felt, an that maybe some kind of negative
energy</B>
<P><B>was left behind by the people, I presumed young boys,  who spray
painted</B>
<P><B>the word on the garage door.  He said maybe and that some people had</B>
<P><B>said I was very intuitive.</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>About 10 months later, my brother in law Gary, came to our house, he</B>
<P><B>seemed more upset than angry.     He had talked to the next door</B>
<P><B>neighbor, and he had told Gary that the women that lived in his house</B>
<P><B>before him had committed suicide.   She stood on the back of   her
care,</B>
<P><B>stepped off  and hung herself.  Then I got that nasty cold chill. 
 We</B>
<P><B>couldn't understand if Gary was upset because of the full disclosure
law</B>
<P><B>being breached, or that the house could be haunted.  The three of us</B>
<P><B>talked about lawsuit.  But when my husband went to bed, I told Gary
if</B>
<P><B>he was more upset, than angry, he should just go to every room in the</B>
<P><B>house and speak in a stern voice saying, " I demand that you leave
this</B>
<P><B>house, I live here now, you do not belong here.  Leave now".  I don't</B>
<P><B>know if he ever did that, or not, he always acts funny when I try to</B>
<P><B>bring it up.  So that is all that happened.</B>

<H3><A NAME=black>Black Figures</A>
</H3><P><B>by fekete1@marshall.edu</B>
<P>
<P><B>Hi,  I don't have any pictures, or sound files. But, I just wanted
to</B>
<P><B>share my story, and maybe you can give me an idea of what on earth
it was I saw?</B>
<P><B>When I was six, I shared a room with my older brother. He was fast</B>
<P><B>asleep, but I couldn't rest. I remember tossing, and turning. I had
this toy closet,</B>
<P><B>with a short door on it. I looked at the door, and saw a large "hole"
in it.</B>
<P><B>It was black, with no real shape, and it had a hole in the middle of
it. The</B>
<P><B>only spot that wasn't black. Anyway, I get up, and shake the curtains,
trying to</B>
<P><B>see if it was a shadow. I put my hand in front of it. I move my toys,
and</B>
<P><B>dolls. &nbsp;What is making the shadow? I thought. I stood in front
of it, and just</B>
<P><B>stared. &nbsp;It then moved off the door, and just hovered in front
of me.</B>
<P><B>Now, this is where it sounds REALLY stupid, but remember I was only</B>
<P><B>a kid, I asked it if it wanted to play chase, I was frightened, but</B>
<P><B>didn't know what else to do. I turned, and ran, and looked, seeing
it coming behind</B>
<P><B>me, I look up at my door, (My room had no door, just an opening) and
there</B>
<P><B>was a black shadowy figure (like the smaller one) but in the shape
of a</B>
<P><B>very very tall man. He was blocking my way out. But I didn't care.
I ran</B>
<P><B>through him, and into my parents room, under their covers, and never
peeked out.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Years later, when I was around 14, my best friend spent hte night
with</B>
<P><B>me in that same room, and told me she woke up around 5 AM to see a
tall</B>
<P><B>shadowy man looking down at us in the darkness. She thought it was
my</B>

<H3><A NAME=white>The White Lady and Friends</A>
</H3><P><B>by WiddleBee@floridaska.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>When my father was young (approx. 9-12 years old) he lived in Gary,
IN, where, reportedly, the White Lady was said to be seen.  He and his friends
decided to go  to see the apparition "for themselves" one night.  (That same
day, my grandmother had bought my father a new pair of shoes.)  Apparently,
the ghost was usually seen on the banks of a stream in the area, and many
people had also decided to go ghost watching that same night.  From what
I understand, it turned into sort of an impromptu camping party, with people
sharing stories, food, and tents.  My father's new shoes were stiff and
uncomfortable, so he took them off and went to his friends car to get some
potatoes and aluminum foil (to bake potatoes for dinner) when someone shouted
"There she is!"  My father was so frightened (even though he never saw her),
that he ran all the way back home.  The next day, his mother asked him where
his new shoes were.  He told her what happened and got in trouble for leaving
his shoes (not because he was out looking for ghosts!) </B>
<P>
<P><B>My father was in the Army, and consequently, we were uprooted and moved
every few years.  Our family was stationed on Fort Meade, MD during 1990-1992.
 The military houses that we were living in had been built during WWII. 
Our particular block was said to have been haunted.  Two of our friends who
were sisters told of the time they were at home alone, downstairs, when they
heard the sound of water running upstairs.  They went up to find the faucet
to the bathtub had been turned on "full blast" and the tub had already filled
with water and was overflowing onto the floor. </B>
<P><B>The Pink Lady/ The Disco Lady </B>
<P><B>My sister had two experiences with ghosts in our own house.  One night,
she woke up to find the shadow of a woman standing near her bed, as if examining
her.  My sister said that the woman was dressed in "70's clothes" and had
a "huge afro."  The woman laid her and on my sister's forehead (as if taking
her temperature).  My sister said her hand was very cool.  My sister closed
her eyes for a minute (how she remained so calm, I'll never know!) and when
she opened them again, the woman was gone.  (My sister went back to sleep,
by the way.)  My sister also came home from school one day (the house was
empty) and saw a woman in a pink dress going up the stairs.  She was so startled,
and said "Don't ever do that to me again!"  The woman turned to face my sister,
then disappeared. </B>
<P><B>The Peanut Butter Man </B>
<P><B>When I was about 15 years old, my friend Katie invited me over to her
house for a birthday slumber party.  Her living room (where all 10-15 were
to spend the night) faced two huge sliding glass doors that led outside to
their deck.  Katie had told us of the Peanut Butter Man, a ghost that would
sit on their deck and eat peanut butter.  (That's all he ever did.)  Most
of us were pretty skeptical (her parents blamed in on a trick of the warped
glass they were going to replace when the renovated their deck in the following
year.)  Some time passed, when someone looked out onto the deck and said
"There he is!".  I looked out and saw a blurry man sitting on one of the
chairs, dipping a knife (or a long finger) into a jar of peanut butter. 
He sat there with his legs crossed; he seemed perfectly content.  We all
screamed and dove into our sleeping bags, and after a while, he disappeared.
 Her parents did have the deck renovated, and the sliding glass doors replaced.
 I fell out of touch with Katie, but ran into her best friend a few years
later, and she told me that they still see the Peanut Butter Man to this
day. </B>
<P><B>The Indian </B>
<P><B>My uncle lives in Hammond, IN.  He 100% believes in ghosts (although
I don't know if he believed in them before his experiences or after.)  He
tells several stories of a Native American ghost that protects his house.
 Several of my cousins have seen this ghost as well (including his own children.)
 Apparently, their house was built on some land that belonged to a small
tribe.  My uncle has seen the Indian pass through the halls, as if inspecting
and making sure everything thing is all right.  One night, his two sons,
and two of our cousins (who were both male) were in one of the upstairs bedrooms,
trying to rig one of the tv's to get the Playboy channel.  There was a knock
on the door; when they opened it, the Indian was there.  They all screamed
and he disappeared.  (So much for the Playboy channel.)  On another occasion,
his sons were having a few friends over for a slumber party.  My uncle when
to check on them and ran into the Indian, dressed in full "war paint" complete
with headdress.  My uncle said the Indian seemed very unhappy about these
interlopers being in the house.  My uncle tried to explain that they were
just a bunch of kids having a sleep-over.  The Indian seemed to take this
into consideration, and disappeared.  My uncle has since sold the house to
my aunt and her family.  As far as I know, they haven't seen the Indian.

<P><B>  Personally, I think I would have a heart-attack if I ran into anything
more active/malevolent than the Peanut Butter Man. My complements on all
of your pages, I have enjoyed very much what I've seen and read, and I look
forward to reading the rest! </B>

<H3><A NAME=face>The Blue Face Lady</A>
</H3><P><B>by jake9889@hotmail.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>When I was about 4 or 5, maybe even younger I remember one night I
was </B>
<P><B>sleeping in my room, and I awoke, I don't know why I did, I may have
</B>
<P><B>been dreaming, anyways I looked ahead of me to my wall and there was
a </B>
<P><B>face on it, it was blue, looked human, and this may sound strange but
it </B>
<P><B>had a hat on that looked like one of those araibian towlels that they
</B>
<P><B>wrap their heads with.It spoke to me, I dont remember what it said,
but </B>
<P><B>oddly, I wasn't afraid of it. The next day I told my mom and dad, I
dont </B>
<P><B>remember their reactor but I asked my mom if she remembered about when
I </B>
<P><B>told her there recently, and she said I used to tell her about "A lady
</B>
<P><B>in blue" visiting me quite often, I only remember telling her about
my </B>
<P><B>only experience once, I might have seen the face more than I remember.
I </B>
<P><B>don't think it was a dream because I don't think I would remember a
</B>
<P><B>dream I had when I was 5 or younger, im 15 now so it was at least 10
or </B>
<P><B>more years ago. Thats my experience, if anyone has had an experience
</B>
<P><B>similar to mine please write me about it.</B>

<H3><A NAME=sense>Sixth Sense</A>
</H3><P><B>by neecie72@earthlink.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>After reading some of the experiences others have shared I wanted to</B>
<P><B>highlight a few of my own. I tend to be very observant of activity</B>
<P><B>around me whether I see it or not. Some people think it's an
over-active</B>
<P><B>imagination but if they felt and saw some of the things I have they</B>
<P><B>would think otherwise. I guess my first experience would have to
begin</B>
<P><B>with what I consider my guardian angel. </B>
<P><B>To start off, I lived in a fairly average house with three bedrooms
and</B>
<P><B>two bathrooms which was built in 1960. There were no previous owners.
My</B>
<P><B>room was at the end of a long hallway with my parents room next to
it.</B>
<P><B>Quit convinient for late night toilles. When I was around six years
old</B>
<P><B>I had my first experience with a world other than my own. I remember
it</B>
<P><B>so clearly. I had been asleep and had a disturbing dream. I woke up,</B>
<P><B>about to call for my mother. At the time my bed was on the opposite
wall</B>
<P><B>of the door and I could see my parents room and most of the hallway.</B>
<P><B>Before I called out I saw, what I thought was my mother, come into
the</B>
<P><B>room. I had a distinct feeling of peace immediately. I saw her
clearly</B>
<P><B>wearing her blue bathrobe with the blue and white stripe down the
center</B>
<P><B>and rollers in her hair. She walked into the room and up the length
of</B>
<P><B>my bed. When she reached the head of the bed I put out my hand to her</B>
<P><B>and felt nothing but cool air. She just looked down, smiled and</B>
<P><B>vanished. It did not frighten me that she was gone. Just the opposite.
I</B>
<P><B>felt relieved and immediately fell asleep. The next morning, when I</B>
<P><B>awoke, I saw my mother in the living room and noticed she did not
have</B>
<P><B>any rollers in her hair. I asked if she had worn any the night before</B>
<P><B>and she said no. I then asked if she had come into my room that night</B>
<P><B>and again the answer was no. I did not say anything further in case
she</B>
<P><B>would say I was just dreaming. I knew then as I do now that I was not</B>
<P><B>dreaming. It wasn't until a few years later that I told her when
another</B>
<P><B>strange thing happened to me as I lay in bed. </B>
<P>
<P><B>I was about 15 at the time and having trouble sleeping. My room had</B>
<P><B>since been arranged differently with the head of my bed moved to the</B>
<P><B>diagnol corner from my door still viewing my parents room. As I lay</B>
<P><B>waiting for sleep to take me I had the strangest feeling overcome me.</B>
<P><B>(This has happened twice since.) I was laying on my side staring at
the</B>
<P><B>opposite wall when my vision began to tunnel. I felt my body begin
to</B>
<P><B>numb and could hear, distinctly, my heart beat slow. At first I
thought</B>
<P><B>I was slowly falling asleep until I realized that I was very much
awake.</B>
<P><B>I was still staring at the wall and I could make out my hand laying
in</B>
<P><B>front of me. I tried to move but could not. I tried to call out and</B>
<P><B>could not. I thought I was dying. I could still hear my heart slow
and</B>
<P><B>was watching as my eyesight dimmed. Just before all went black I heard
a</B>
<P><B>distinct voice, which I thought was my mother call my name. I heard
it</B>
<P><B>several times before my body and mind were together again. As soon
as I</B>
<P><B>could move I sat up to see if my mother was in the room. She was not.
I</B>
<P><B>then went in my parent's room where both were sound asleep. I was</B>
<P><B>extremely perplexed and exhausted after the ordeal. The next morning
I</B>
<P><B>told my mother about the night before and about the time I was six.
She</B>
<P><B>told me that must have been my guardian angel coming in a form that
was</B>
<P><B>soothing to me. </B>
<P>
<P><B>I have now been to college,twice, and had other strange activity that</B>
<P><B>did and did not include my angel. That can go for another time. I was</B>
<P><B>wondering if anyone else has had experiences like this. And never
forget</B>
<P><B>that the young are always prone to see and hear what we cannot
because</B>
<P><B>they are more open to the world than their elders. It's not always
an</B>
<P><B>over-active imagination either.</B>
