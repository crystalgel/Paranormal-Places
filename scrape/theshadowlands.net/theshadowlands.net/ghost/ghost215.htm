<p><b>The Flame in the Room</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: butterfli_gerl@yahoo.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>This isn't our story, but it happened to our aunt. Our</b>
<br><b>aunt Jessica, when she was a young teenager, she was</b>
<br><b>lying in her bedroom on her bed in complete darkness</b>
<br><b>(which is now our grampa's room) and suddenly she</b>
<br><b>looked over and saw a candle flame, except there was</b>
<br><b>no candle! While lying there freaked out she saw it</b>
<br><b>glide across the wall. At the time her father (our</b>
<br><b>grampa) was out of town and only her and our gramma</b>
<br><b>were home. She's now 24 and still has strange</b>
<br><b>experiences sometimes. Many of our relatives have also</b>
<br><b>had strange experiences in that house; our grampa, our</b>
<br><b>mom, our aunts, and our uncle have seen ghosts and</b>
<br><b>have had weird stuff happen to them while living</b>
<br><b>there. It's a family of 8 kids and 2 adults, and many</b>
<br><b>have had paranormal things happen, and the next</b>
<br><b>generation is starting to have things happen too. Me</b>
<br><b>(Nikki) being 15 &amp; my sister Gretchen being 12 and our</b>
<br><b>other sister Alice being 10, are all fond of ghosts</b>
<br><b>and happenings. To this day, we don't know what these</b>
<br><b>things mean, but we hope to get a sign someday.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Four Weeks In December</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Pershing1017@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>This is a story of three friends I know quite well, all female, who
decided</b>
<br><b>to rent a home in New Orleans during December 1991.&nbsp; Having
decided to share</b>
<br><b>a home in an effort to provide more affordable rent, the girls rented
a</b>
<br><b>three-bedroom home that I would estimate to be about forty years
old.</b>
<br><b>Charlotte was the one to locate the house and soon convinced the
others that</b>
<br><b>that home in particular would best suit their needs as the rent
was very</b>
<br><b>affordable and each girl would receive their own room.&nbsp; Charlotte
decided to</b>
<br><b>rent the home despite the fact that a neighbor told her the house
was</b>
<br><b>"haunted" as she was looking over the property.&nbsp; Not believing
in ghost nor</b>
<br><b>taking him seriously, she disregarded his claim and proceeded to
look over</b>
<br><b>the property.&nbsp; One of the bedrooms was a master bedroom and
had its own bath</b>
<br><b>so Mary volunteered to pay a little extra each month in return for
that room.</b>
<br><b>The first sign that things were not so right with the home began
when certain</b>
<br><b>items from each of their rooms would turn up missing.&nbsp; They
would ask each</b>
<br><b>other if it were borrowed but each time, they would all deny ever
borrowing</b>
<br><b>things from the other.&nbsp; To further confuse them, these items
would suddenly</b>
<br><b>start showing up in different locations throughout the house - under
the</b>
<br><b>beds; on the closet floors; on top of the refrigerator, etc.&nbsp;
This continued</b>
<br><b>to happen periodically.&nbsp; One evening, Mary was home alone watching
television</b>
<br><b>lying across the sofa.&nbsp; To the side of the television was a
decorative oak</b>
<br><b>grain door.&nbsp; As she was watching the TV, she suddenly noticed
something</b>
<br><b>appearing on the back of the door. It was an image, about three-by-three,
of</b>
<br><b>the Virgin Mary.&nbsp; Totally baffled and astonished at what she
was seeing, the</b>
<br><b>image suddenly changed to a huge skull with blood on it.&nbsp; Mary
panicked, fled</b>
<br><b>the house, and remained by her mother's until the other two girls
arrived</b>
<br><b>home later that night.&nbsp; After all attempts to derive a logical
and rational</b>
<br><b>explanation for what Charlotte might have seen, they decided to
forget about</b>
<br><b>it.</b>
<br><b>It was not long after when they started to hear unusual noises coming
from</b>
<br><b>empty rooms of the house.&nbsp; Upon searching for the source, they
could never</b>
<br><b>find anything.&nbsp; The noises seemed to originate from Mary's
master bedroom.</b>
<br><b>One evening as Mary and Victoria, the third girl, was watching television,</b>
<br><b>they heard very loud noises coming from Mary's room as if furniture
were</b>
<br><b>being dragged and tossed around.&nbsp; Knowing that Mary was not
home, they became</b>
<br><b>frightened and did not know if an intruder was in the house or if
the strange</b>
<br><b>noises were returning.&nbsp; Together, they walked towards Mary's
closed door and</b>
<br><b>the noises suddenly stopped.&nbsp; They slowly opened the door,
turned on the</b>
<br><b>light, and saw that Mary's bed was on the other side of the room.&nbsp;
Again,</b>
<br><b>Charlotte fled the house taking Victoria with her.&nbsp; They returned
later with</b>
<br><b>Mary and explained what transpired.&nbsp; Mary, still in disbelief
and unable to</b>
<br><b>once again derive a logical conclusion, stayed the night in her
bedroom.&nbsp; The</b>
<br><b>next night, however, turned out to be not so nice for Mary.&nbsp;
As she was home</b>
<br><b>alone this time, she began hearing the sound of furniture being
dragged</b>
<br><b>around in her room.&nbsp; As she went to investigate, she saw the
same that</b>
<br><b>happened the night before.&nbsp; Standing there in total fear, she
began hearing</b>
<br><b>noises in the bathroom.&nbsp; As she turned to look, she saw the
shower curtain</b>
<br><b>moving rapidly back and forth as if someone was standing there doing
it.</b>
<br><b>Mary panicked and fled the house never to return.</b>
<br><b>For whatever reason, the other girls decided they would attempt
to remain in</b>
<br><b>the house a little longer.&nbsp; They had friends over one night
and one of the</b>
<br><b>friends, a guy named Carl, drove up, and as he was walking to the
house, saw</b>
<br><b>something strange.&nbsp; He clearly saw a shadow or something he
was not able to</b>
<br><b>define - lurking in front of the house.&nbsp; He went into the house,
told the</b>
<br><b>others what he saw, and departed.&nbsp; After that time, he refused
to go near the</b>
<br><b>house and would wait on the corner when picking up the girls.&nbsp;
The usual</b>
<br><b>things continued happening - strange noises, missing objects, and
soon</b>
<br><b>footsteps.&nbsp; Charlotte and Victoria were on the sofa one evening
when they</b>
<br><b>both felt a pair of hands press down on their legs as they were
about to get</b>
<br><b>up to investigate noises.&nbsp; It held them for several seconds
before letting</b>
<br><b>go.&nbsp; I am still not sure to this day why they did not leave
the house as Mary</b>
<br><b>did.&nbsp; But that was soon to change.</b>
<br><b>One evening, the girls heard footsteps walking down the hallway.&nbsp;
They both</b>
<br><b>became frightened and together they walked towards the hallway.&nbsp;
What they</b>
<br><b>saw still frightens them to this day and Victoria gets goose pimples
just</b>
<br><b>talking about it.&nbsp; Walking towards them in the hallway was
a huge dark</b>
<br><b>shadow, almost as high as the ceiling, with its arms stretched out
towards</b>
<br><b>them.&nbsp; They could clearly see a long cape on it and it was
wearing a short,</b>
<br><b>"stove pipe" hat.&nbsp; The girls panicked in fear, ran out the
front door without</b>
<br><b>closing it, and did not return that night.&nbsp; The next day, they
returned, with</b>
<br><b>lots of help and company, and moved their things out.</b>
<br><b>Charlotte decided to do her own investigation and looked up records
at city</b>
<br><b>hall.&nbsp; The home had been a rental home for the past several
years and no one</b>
<br><b>stayed in the house for very long.&nbsp; Charlotte checked with
several of the</b>
<br><b>neighbors and discovered that the neighbor who first warned her
was correct.</b>
<br><b>The house was haunted and the neighbor across the street said lightning</b>
<br><b>struck the home at least three times that he remembered.&nbsp; She
also discovered</b>
<br><b>that previous occupants of the house were satan worshippers and
she</b>
<br><b>remembered seeing red wax on the carpet when they moved in.&nbsp;
Worshipping was</b>
<br><b>a problem in that part of town for a short period of time during
the late</b>
<br><b>80's.</b>
<br><b>That home is a short distance from my home, within walking distance,
and the</b>
<br><b>last time I passed there, I saw it was obvious the home was still
unable to</b>
<br><b>be rented very easily.&nbsp; There was a sign on the front lawn
saying, "I, John</b>
<br><b>Doe, am an ex-con who was convicted for child molestation".&nbsp;
Louisiana state</b>
<br><b>law requires that notice.&nbsp; I don't pass there anymore as the
home is pretty</b>
<br><b>creepy looking, especially at night.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Friends Haunted House</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Dtang2000@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My best friends house, is one of the
oldest in our town. I don't know</b>
<br><b>exactly how far back it dates, but it looks like late 1890s early
1900s</b>
<br><b>construction. It's the normal looking house that you would find
in a plans</b>
<br><b>town. Of course the farm land has since been turned into a highway,
and other</b>
<br><b>things, but the house it's self still remains.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The "ghost" seems to only interact
with her little sister who is 18.</b>
<br><b>It reacts to the mood she is in, and when she wants to do something,
and</b>
<br><b>doesn't the "ghost does it for her. In once instance, She and her
Father had</b>
<br><b>had a fight, and he taught her not to slam the doors. Well, she
left out of</b>
<br><b>the front door which is near the stairs leading to the second floor.
Her dad</b>
<br><b>heard the slams of feet up the stairs, and then the doors began
to slam</b>
<br><b>repeatedly. When he went up there, the doors slammed one more time
and when</b>
<br><b>he opened her bed room door to yell at her, she wasn't there.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They have told me a lot more stories,
but that is the one that freaked</b>

<br><b>Ft. Harrison Experience</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: pvicenti@salud.unm.edu</b><b></b>
<p><b>A few years after our experiences at the House on Tenth Street, I
joined</b>
<br><b>the U.S. Army.&nbsp; After a three year tour in Japan, we went to
Ft.</b>
<br><b>Benjamin Harrison, IN so I could attend my Advanced Course.&nbsp;
Since it</b>
<br><b>was a six month course, I was able to take my family.&nbsp; We found
a nice</b>
<br><b>first floor apartment with three bedrooms and a patio off of the
living</b>
<br><b>room.&nbsp; We were thrilled because we had our cat with us and
he was an</b>
<br><b>illegal resident, no pets allowed.&nbsp; I've read other stories
on this site</b>
<br><b>and many mention the uncanny ability of pets to sense spirits.&nbsp;
Our cat</b>
<br><b>must have been stone deaf to the other world.&nbsp; That or whatever
showed</b>
<br><b>up later did so two months after the cat was discovered and deported</b>
<br><b>back home to my parents in New Mexico.&nbsp; Anyway, three months
into our</b>
<br><b>residence, I noticed that I had started to feel uncomfortable if
any of</b>
<br><b>the bedroom doors were closed.&nbsp; My husband and I shared the
master</b>
<br><b>suite, our son had the room next to ours, and the third was used
as the</b>
<br><b>family room and housed the tv, stereo, etc.&nbsp; Very early one
morning I</b>
<br><b>awoke because the bed was shaking.&nbsp; I slept on my stomach with
face</b>
<br><b>turned to the side of the bed, with one arm up by my face beside
the</b>
<br><b>pillow, and the other arm down.&nbsp; I woke up not so much because
the bed</b>
<br><b>was shaking, but because the movement was forcing my face into the</b>
<br><b>pillow and I couldn't breath.&nbsp; Because of the three years in
Japan, I</b>
<br><b>thought it was an earthquake.&nbsp; I tried to move and to tell
my husband to</b>
<br><b>wake up we had to wake our son up and get out of the apartment.&nbsp;
I found</b>
<br><b>I couldn't talk, then I found that I couldn't move my arm, my wrist
was</b>
<br><b>being pushed into the mattress, as was my face.&nbsp; I could move
my feet,</b>
<br><b>my body from the waist down, but from the waist up I was being pushed</b>
<br><b>down into the mattress.&nbsp; I turned my left eye upward and saw
two glowing</b>
<br><b>red "eyes" for want of a better word up above by the side of the
bed.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>don't know if there was anything else to see.&nbsp; I was terrified.&nbsp;
I</b>
<br><b>couldn't move, I couldn't call for help because my mouth was mostly</b>
<br><b>shoved into the pillow, and I thought I was going to die.&nbsp;
Then it just</b>
<br><b>stopped.&nbsp; It never happened again, but sixteen years later
I still sleep</b>
<br><b>with my hand tucked under the pillow, not lying beside it.&nbsp;
One thing</b>
<br><b>about this story, I have tried to submit it before on at least three</b>
<br><b>occasions.&nbsp; I keep getting it back with a message that it is</b>
<br><b>undeliverable.&nbsp; One of those times was to another site.&nbsp;
Decided to try</b>
<br><b>one more time.&nbsp; It may be a story that doesn't want to be told.</b>

<p><b>A Water Ghost</b>
<br><b>By: benny12thman@earthlink.net</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;My experiences happened ca. 1952 as I stated in my earlier
correspondence. I always feel compelled to affix a notice to the telling
of my story. I will do so here : The following events that I will relate
are true to the best of my memory.</b>
<br><b>The first occurrence that happened and started about 6 months of
puzzlements was at my brother in law’s house in Grand Prairie, Texas. My
new wife and I were staying with him and my sister. One Thursday morning
I awakened and as I started to put on my left shoe I found it to be full
of a liquid. Apparently it was water. I raised a good bit of sand and accused
my bro in law of playing a crude joke on me. He disclaimed all knowledge
of the matter and I believed him- he was not the kind for such shenanigans.
True it had rained that night after midnight and the shoe was sitting on
the floor by an open window. But the right shoe had been closer to the
window and was dry plumb. There was no water on the floor.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Shortly after this I obtained employment in St. Louis Mo.(
of all places to be) One morning I was standing in front of the dresser,
getting ready to go to work. I glanced down at a metal wastebasket, which
was by the end of the dresser, and low on a bee hole, the wastebasket was
about half full of water. (In all of these happenings I assumed that the
liquid was water, never actual tested it, but always smelled it. This to
silence the ever--present skeptics that had it that me or wife was having
bladder/kidney problems.) The wife disclaimed any knowledge of how the
water got in the wastebasket and I certainly believed her—she was as puzzled
as I was and not one to horse around like this.</b>
<br><b>Several more occurrences of mysterious water showings happened.
Maybe five or six more. But I shall not write about all of them. Each happening
was similar to the ones that I have related: Water appearing in the apartment
from no apparent source. Finally I got very tired of the thing. ( Although
I had often stated in earlier days ‘I wish I could encounter something
from the Supernatural so I will know Ghosts and ‘things’ actual exist.’
) I was tired of fellow worker’s kidding and accusing me of urinating around.
I even consulted a Catholic Priest about performing an exorcism. He declined
after learning that I was a Baptist. I was convinced that I was living
with a ghost. I rigged a door bell and switch so that we could close the
bed room door and set the system and go to bed. If the door was opened
a loud bell would sound. The apparatus was installed on the outside of
the bedroom door. For wife or I to disarm the thing we would have to open
the door which would set off the alarm. I wanted assurance that if either
of us went out to get some water for hanky panky or whatever the alarm
would sound. Now for the occurrence that convinced me that I was haunted
by a ?? Wife and I went over to East St. Louis to a party, yes a beer party,
weren’t they always that in those days ? We got back home sometime after
midnight ( Thur AM). Set the alarm and went to bed. I had just drifted
off to sleep, when I suddenly felt water (?) soaking into the bed sheet.
What the ---- I turned on the bed lamp and wife and sat up in bed and saw
water (?) soaking into the bed clothes, disappearing into the lower sheet
and mattress.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I swear that this is a true reporting of what wife and I saw.
The alarm didn’t sound and there was no source of water in the bedroom.</b>
<br><b>Some Additional thoughts.</b>
<br><b>The first occurrence in Grand Prairie happened shortly after I had
found a lost wedding band at the abandoned house where my Grand parents
had lived. I kept the ring for several years then stupidly lost it. I have
always felt that this is associated with my Ghost in some way.</b>
<br><b>Every occurrence that I could definitely recall in later years,
happened Wed PM, or Thur AM.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;We moved back to Grand Prairie in 1954, had a few more occurrences.
The last one on a News Year’ eve. Kitchen table cloth was wet when we got
home, had been dry when we left. The Ghost , Spirit, Haint , or whatever
it was has not troubled me for about 50 years. I will have 74 years in
November. I know that some day soon I will know all the answers. Until
then I maintain ‘ There are more things in Heaven and Earth, than are dreamt
of in our Philosophy’.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Sincerely yours and best wishes for The Shadowlands site</b><b></b>

<br><b>My Best Friends House</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: lexie rote</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I have known my best friend Sonya for 12 years now. We grew up together,
and I have known her family to be as my own. We are pretty close, and have
lots of fun together. Over the years I have heard so many stories about
her house being haunted by the pervious owner. They have named him Leroy.
I think he likes it because he doesn’t give them that much trouble, or
maybe I am wrong!</b>
<br><b>Before Sonya’s family bought the house it was vacant for two years.
No one wanted to buy it because they knew the man that owned it had killed
himself in that very house. When they moved in, and had lived there for
a few years strange things started to happen. Things in rooms would be
moved around, and objects would be hidden from the family members. One
of the major problems was that Sonya’s dad was diabetic so he had to take
insolent for his blood sugar. He always kept the meds on the fridge, but
one time Leroy had hid the meds. Everyone looked every where for them,
but couldn’t find them. After a while Bob (Sonya’s dad) said "Leroy give
me back my meds!" A few minutes later the meds were back on the fridge.</b>
<br><b>Sonya told me one time her friend Amber had brought over her remote
control car for them to play with. They had played all day, and finally
the batteries had died. That night both of them were lying down on Sonya’s
bed watching TV. Sonya noticed the car on the floor start to move back
and forth ramming into the TV. Sonya told Amber to stop moving the car,
but Amber said she wasn’t doing it. She pointed to the remote, and said
it’s on top of the TV. She also pointed out that later that evening the
batteries had died. Both of them were scared, and later they find out that
Sonya’s uncle had died that night.</b>
<br><b>A few years later there was a big family party that was taking place
at their house. I was invited just as others were too. We were all sitting
in the family room watching TV when Debby (a friend of the family) had
gotten up to go to the restroom. She began to walk down the hallway when
she moved to the side to let what seemed to be Bob walking down the hall
pass her. Debby greeted him, but he didn’t say anything. She returned to
the family room where everyone was at, and asked Bob why he didn’t say
hello when she let him walk by, and greeted him. Everyone was at a lose
for words because Bob had been sitting there the whole time. He said "Debby
I believe you have just met our ghost Leroy." She got scared after that.</b>
<br><b>Three months later after the incident with Debby; Sonya’s family
and I were sitting down watching sightings. A lady was talking about how
her ghost would throw dishes out of her cabinets, and things would brake.
Sonya had just happen to say how lucky they were that Leroy didn’t do anything
strange like that. After about two hours later all the dishes came flying
out of the cabinets, and we freaked! Lucky for us nothing broke.</b>
<br><b>Over the summer of 1999 I had spent the night at Sonya’s house.
We were sitting down watching TV. When a commercial came on I got up, and
began to walk down the hall way towards the bathroom. As I walked passed
the kitchen, and out of the corner of my eye I saw a woman standing right
next to the fridge. I stopped, and took another good look, but she was
gone. I knew it was Sonya’s sister’s sister that was the woman because
she had died not to long ago, and had been seen once already at their house.
I was so scared that I ran back to the family room jumped on the couch,
and said I wasn’t going to the bathroom. I told everyone what had happened,
and only Bob believed me because he had seen her earlier that day!</b>
<br><b>Two weeks ago I was at Sonya's house sitting on their couch. The
TV was right in front of me, and the hallway was to the right of me. Sonya
was in her room talking to her boyfriend on the phone. I notice out of
the corner of my eye someone walking down the hallway towards me. As I
turned my head, and said "Oh hi Sonya!" at the same time when my head was
looking right down the hall no one was there. Sonya came out of her room,
and asked whom I was talking to. I told her that I just thought I saw her
walking out of the room.</b>
<br><b>These are a few true stories that have happened at my best friend’s
house. I have no say in what you want to believe, but I thought it would
be nice to share them with you.</b>
<br><b>I read that you said ghost will contact you in a dream. I have had
so many weird dreams come true, that I dont know what to believe anymore.
Maybe I have a gift or maybe its a ghost helping me. Please read this,
and tell me what you think.</b>
<br><b>I have this problem, but my mother calls it a gift. I dont understand
it at all. When I was 16 I first started to notice strange things. I had
a dream about me going babysitting one morning. In my dream I went to go
babysit for a friend of the family that just lived right down the street.
I got there and went to the back of the house where I found Dean (the dad)
Draining the swimming pool. I asked him why he was doing that and He told
me because Carly (the daughter) was having a pool party for her birthday,
and the left side of the pool was cracked. He needed to fix it. I walked
into Carly's room to see what she was doing. She was excited about the
party, and told me it was her birthday. Well I woke up, and got ready to
go babysit. I got to the house, and found myself in the back yard with
Dean in the pool with me asking the same question, and getting the same
answer. I just thought this was kind a funny. Well the next dream I had
was a year later. My best friend Sonya, and I were not talking for the
summer because here boyfriend didn't like me much. On a Sunday morning
I was sleeping, and had a dream where I was with Sonya, and we were driving
to go see someone, but I didn't know who it was. She took me down these
stairs, and there was her whole family. Everyone was happy to see me, and
gave me hugs. I asked Sonya why we were in the jail area, but I couldn't
hear her. She said someone's name, but I couldn't hear her. She was totally
mute. I woke up, and was really worried, and told my mom about it. She
told me it was just a dream, and to call Sonya. I called Sonya, but no
one was home so I left a message. That following week I had another dream.
It was Monday. This time I was out side with Sonya. Everyone was dressed
in black, and they were all sad, and some crying. I looked at everyone,
and started to feel really sad. I asked Sonya once again why we were there,
and who died, but she talked, and was mute. I looked at the grave, and
the casket with flowers all over it. I couldn't think because I felt so
bad. I woke up really worried, and called Sonya again. No one was home
so I left a message.. A month passed, and I finally got a phone call from
her. She wanted to know if I could babysit for her aunt, but I said no.
I told her that I have been really worried about her lately, and I needed
to tell her something important. So I told her all about my dreams. She
was silent for a few minutes, and I asked her if she was ok. She asked
me when I had these dreams, and I told her the days, but that I didn't
remember the date. She was very upset. She told me on a Sunday of last
month her brother was put in jail for drugs. Then on a Wednesday he was
let out for good behavior. He through a party for being let out, and over
dosed on drugs, and died. His Funeral was Monday. I was scared. I didn't
understand any of it. I told my mom, and she just said it was nothing to
worry about. That I just missed her so much that it brought me to know
things that were happening to her. I still didn't understand.</b>
<br><b>Thats not it either. I had a dream my brothers car would get broken
into, and guys would take things. I told him to lock his doors because
he never did. Come to find out someone tried to get into his car, but couldn't.</b>
<br><b>Whats even more scary for me is now they are not dreams anymore.
I just know things before they happen. The other day I knew my mom was
going to get pulled over by a cop, but I didn't tell her, because I didn't
think anything of it. She called me after I got out of school, and told
me she was pulled over by a cop.</b>
<br><b>I Knew my parents were going to get a divorce a year before it even
happened. Just little things I know, and I don't understand. I even had
this one dream about this guy my mom was dating. She actually in real life
at the time wasn't dating him, but in my dream she was. I went out to dinner
with both of them, and he hated me because I had a gift, and he knew it.
He knew that I could see things before they happened, and I even dreamed
about them also. He tried to turn my family against me, and then tried
to kill me. I really didn't think anything of it. I remember coming home
that night, and my mom greeted me at the door telling me she had a date
over. I went to introduce myself, and I just about dropped on the floor.
It was the same man I had dreamed about earlier that morning. I waited
until he left, and then I told my mom everything. She told me she wasn't
interested any ways. I dont understand any of this, and sometimes it scares
me a lot. Can you please give me any information at all? My mom tells me
that she believes I may have an angle telling me these things. She also
believes it might be her great aunt because she use to talk to dead family
members. My mom told me that when she was little her aunt told her that
she might hear her talking, but not to worry about it because she was just
talking to family members. Sometimes my great great grandmother would visit
her, and tell her when something was going to happen to a family member,
and who was going to die next. I thought it was really weird, but my mom
told me she believed it because she would feel cold around the time her
aunt would start talking to these ghosts.</b><b></b>

<p><b>My Haunting</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Darlinggrl2@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Hi my name is Melanie and about eleven years ago my parents purchased
an old</b>
<br><b>house. I was fourteen at the time and immediately I knew that this
house was</b>
<br><b>special. I could sense it and not too long after, I began to experience</b>
<br><b>unusual things. No one else would believe me because I apparently
was the</b>
<br><b>only one who was having these experiences. I know that there are
two ghosts</b>
<br><b>for sure---a female and a male. I have heard them whispering and
talking and</b>
<br><b>even giggling in my basement. They seem to stay in the basement
for some</b>
<br><b>reason which is unknown to me. However, my bedroom has been in the
basement</b>
<br><b>for many years and they seem to some type of attatchment to me.
Doors have</b>
<br><b>shut and every night when I go to bed, I can hear a very distinct
snoring</b>
<br><b>sound coming from my brother's old room. His room is right next
to mine and</b>
<br><b>that seems to be the hang-out for my two "friends". No one has been
in this</b>
<br><b>room for awhile. Another thing---maybe coincidence, but bad things
have</b>
<br><b>happened to a few people who have been in my house. When I have
been upset or</b>
<br><b>angered at someone and they come over---something bad happens to
them. My</b>
<br><b>ex-boyfriend"s dad got into a car wreck and two of my friends have
committed</b>
<br><b>suicide. Another person went to prison and so on. I don't want to
go over the</b>
<br><b>list because it's far too long. I am a bit frightened by my ghosts
but I am</b>
<br><b>curious, is it possible that ghosts can become attatched to a living</b>
<br><b>individual? And also, can they hurt people or cause harm? It's actually
kind</b>
<br><b>of strange but I am twenty-five now and I always seem to end up
back here for</b>
<br><b>one reason or another. Every time I have moved out, strange incidents
cause</b>
<br><b>me to have to move back here. So I am just curious--I almost feel
like this</b>
<br><b>house is possessing my life and me. I have a very unusual and uneasy
feeling</b>
<br><b>when I am here but yet, I feel like I am being protected from something.</b>
<br><b>Thank you for your time. Any info that you could give me would be
very</b>
<br><b>helpful.</b>

<p><b>Mothers Story</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: AASacatomato@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi my name is Ashley I live in Sacramento where this
story took place.</b>
<br><b>My mom and grandma have told this story to me many times. Anyways,
when my</b>
<br><b>mom was 15 years old living with her mom, two brothers and sister.
My mom was</b>
<br><b>just old enough to go to work with my grandma to work at some mexican
bar. My</b>
<br><b>grandma gave my aunt direct instructions to be in bed by the time
they got</b>
<br><b>home, with all the lights out.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When my mom and grandma pulled up into the drive
way they noticed that</b>
<br><b>all the lights were on. They rushed in to see if anything was wrong.
when</b>
<br><b>they got in my aunt told them there was someone on the top of the
stair case.</b>
<br><b>They walked over and saw a tall man dressed in a black pin striped
suit. They</b>
<br><b>immediately grabbed all the kids and ran out the door. my grandma
ran to the</b>
<br><b>nearest pay phone where she called the cops. One headed right over
and</b>
<br><b>checked out the house. He found some dust foot prints that lead
to the</b>
<br><b>closet, where there was a push up attic door. The cop looked up
there and</b>
<br><b>told them that there was no dust that had been disturbed.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They decided that they would stay anyways. But
they would all sleep in</b>
<br><b>the same bed. In the middle of the night my mom woke up and saw
that my</b>
<br><b>grandma was sitting up and looking out the window then asked my
mom what she</b>
<br><b>saw. my mom said that she saw two men from the 50's sitting on the
rail. they</b>
<br><b>both agreed that they had to leave before any thing else hapened.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well you can guess they got out of there.</b><b></b>

<br><b>The Falling Paintings&nbsp; Welsh Omen</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;By - mrpelham@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>This story may lack dramatic ingredients such as haunted castles
and headless spectres, but it was sufficiently shocking to prompt me to
reassess my views on the supernatural. I still don't have any answers,
but at least I now have an idea about the scale of my ignorance. This account
is totally true, in so far as I have reported everything just as it happened.</b>
<br><b>In 1989 I was 19 years old and my family was living in Germany.
At the time I was working in another German town in the south and was shocked
to receive a call from my mother telling me my father had been diagnosed
with a serious illness and that I should return home as soon as possible.
Arriving home, I was saddened to learn that the prognosis was not good
and after a short illness he passed away. Obviously my mother was distraught
at this turn of events and both my sisters and I did what we could to comfort
her. One thing that she kept bringing up was that she had known that something
bad was going to happen, as an painting had inexplicably fallen off the
wall while she was doing the house work. According to Welsh superstition
this is a portend of death in the family and we had all heard of this (along
with other folklore) from our Nana, in fact my mother had thought that
the falling painting was fortelling the death of her mother (Nana - then
in her 80's, living with my uncle in London). Both my sisters and I simply
dismissed my mother's claims as being the product of her grief and thought
no more about it.</b>
<br><b>Three years later, I was at University College London (UCL) and
temporarily staying in Clapham Common, London with my uncle and Nana (still
alive but in her mid 80's, effectively blind and a bit deaf). Returning
home one evening I entered the living room to find Nana alone (uncle having
gone to the shops). Somewhat on edge, she told me there had been a loud
crash, something having fallen. I looked for a possible source of the crash
and found that a painting had fallen off the wall, when I told this to
my grandmother she became virtually hysterical saying "oh, oh, something
bad is going to happen, you know what that means, don't you?" I was still
trying to calm her down when my uncle returned from the shops. I informed
him of what had transpired and we exchanged a nervous look, neither of
us wanting to seem like we believed anything, but both feeling noticeably
uneasy. After a while. Nana had calmed down and I went off to bed. By now
the events of the evening had taken on an eerie significance and I began
to wonder if in fact Nana would still be around for breakfast.</b>
<br><b>Walking into the living room the next morning I was so happy to
see everybody alive and well, that it took me a moment to register the
black mood that filled the room. "What's wrong? " I asked. "Myriam is dead,
her son just called to say she died in her sleep last night" replied Nana
in a resigned, if not calm voice.</b>
<br><b>The women that had unexpectedly died, within hours of the picture
falling, was my grandmothers best (surviving) friend and like Nana, had
moved to Clapham Common (a popular Welsh area at that time) from Wales
in the 1950's. Forty years later, still living in the house just around
the corner from Nana, these two old birds used to meet weekly and talk
about the old days.</b>
<br><b>I later asked Nana about the picture falling, but she wasn't in
the least bit shocked. Apparently as a girl in Amlwch, Anglesey (North
Wales) at the beginning of the century, before she moved to South Wales
and learned English, this sort of thing was very much expected.</b>
<br><b>Has anyone else heard of this superstition or is it just our family?
I would be interested to hear of any other particularly Welsh stories or
superstitions.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Ghost Cat</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: antiquefreek@rtcol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hello,</b>
<br><b>Thought I would share this story with you. Two years ago I had to
put my 17 year old tiger cat to sleep. I was with him when he died. This
cat, Turbo, and I had a very close relationship. He followed me all around
the house. We have seen him 3 times since he died.</b>
<br><b>Six months after he died, I got another tiger cat exactly the same
color, Morgan.</b>
<br><b>We had a small hole cut into the furnace room door years back and
kept Turbo's cat box in there. When I got Morgan, I covered the hole with
cardboard to keep him out untill he got older. One day I was putting clothes
into the dryer, and off to the side I could very distinctly see a tiger
cat jump through that hole into the furnace room, there was absolutely
no sound. I thought the kitten had taken the covering off of the door and
went in there, but when I looked, the board was still covering the hole.
The kitten had been in the bedroom sleeping. When he came out, he sat up
real streight, ran to the furnace room door, put his nose to the floor
and started digging, trying to get into the furnace room.</b>
<br><b>The second time I was carring an arm load of dry clothes from the
furnace room and looked down to the floor, trying not to trip on anything.
Tight quarters. I saw a tiger cat weaving in and out around my feet under
the clothes. I thought it was the new cat. I put the clothes down, and
saw nothing. When I called the kitten, he came to me from another far corner
of the house yawning and stretching.</b>
<br><b>The third time, my husband got the honor. We sleep upstairs&nbsp;
with our bedroom doors shut. He had gotten up in the night to use the bathroom,
when he came out into the hall he saw a tiger cat laying in front of my
bedroom door across the hall. He said at first he&nbsp; thought it was
the Morgan, untill the cat got up and walked through my&nbsp; bedroom door.
Morgan ,we discovered in the morning, had been accidently locked in a downstairs
closet all night long.</b>
<br><b>I cant tell you how many times I have felt Turbo jump on my bed,
walk across it and curl up behind my knees. I used to get up and turn on
the light only to find nothing there. Now I just smile and go to sleep.
I know he's still there.</b>
<br><b>We are not in the least afraid of this little cat spirit. He was
a dear friend in life and would also be a friend in death. My only sad
thought is that if we move some day, I hope he comes along with us. Seeing
him brightens my day.</b>
<br><b>I have a neighbor that recently lost a dog. It seems she experiences
the same type of things that we are. Her dog&nbsp; used to knock a peticular
pillow on the floor when he was upset with her. She says that now he is
gone, she bets she picks that pillow up off of the floor at least 7 or
8 times a day and no one has been in the room.</b>
<br><b>Thank you for your time.</b>

<br><b>Revolutionary War Hauntings</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Sweetylou003@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I am a Revolutionary War re-enactor, I portray a women camp follower
of the</b>
<br><b>Revolutionary War. I love re-enacting, it takes you back to the
past during</b>
<br><b>the American Revolution, not only that but I get to travel to different</b>
<br><b>battlefields, Colonial grounds.....etc. of that time, and seek out
the</b>
<br><b>hauntings of them. I have some stories of Two places that I went
to recently</b>
<br><b>in July and August. In July we traveled (along with many other groups)
two</b>
<br><b>Fort No. 4 in charlestown NH. This was an actual Fort used in the
Revolution.</b>
<br><b>At the end of the day when the public had left me and my two other
friends</b>
<br><b>that re-enact with me (by the way I am only 16yrs old) were walking
down to</b>
<br><b>the river (The Connecticut river) and as we were walking my dress
started to</b>
<br><b>move around as if there was a light breeze blowing through, but
there was no</b>
<br><b>breeze at all, I just shrugged it off and went on my way to the
river. That</b>
<br><b>night there was a colonial party in the courtyard of the Fort, everyone
from</b>
<br><b>the British side and the American side was there dressed in there
best</b>
<br><b>outfits (we still dress Colonial even when the public is not there)
well</b>
<br><b>anyways I was sitting on this big log in the corner of the courtyard
with</b>
<br><b>Kelley and Racheal and all of a sudden we felt this really Cold
feeling, but</b>
<br><b>it was not cold out, it was just right, and I asked Kelley and Rachael
if</b>
<br><b>they felt cold and they said they did too, and so we got up and
we did not</b>
<br><b>have that "cold feeling" anymore. Later we decided to go to bed,
we all sleep</b>
<br><b>in 18th century tents, I had my own tent and Kelley and Racheal
slept in the</b>
<br><b>same tent because they are sisters. It was really quiet out and
it sounded</b>
<br><b>like someone was walking by the tents so I thought it was someone
going off</b>
<br><b>to there tent, I looked through the part of the tent where it ties
together</b>
<br><b>to see who it was and there was no one to be seen, and I still heard
the</b>
<br><b>steps of someone walking.</b>
<br><b>My next story was in August. The Battle of Bennington. I only have
one</b>
<br><b>account of this event. Me and Racheal were the last ones in the
whole entire</b>
<br><b>Camp to go to sleep, we weren't tired that night. We were sitting
under the</b>
<br><b>tent fly (it was a tent covering they used where they would have
there</b>
<br><b>chairs, food, entertainment....etc. It was a quiet night and we
were just</b>
<br><b>sitting there. We were watching the fire of the camp next to us,
because they</b>
<br><b>all had gone off to bed and left there fire burning really good,
so we</b>
<br><b>thought we would keep an eye on it, so anyway I looked over at it
to see how</b>
<br><b>low the fire was because I was getting tired, and it was just coals
burning.</b>
<br><b>so I got up and Racheal was half asleep and I said "we can go to
bed now</b>
<br><b>there fire is just about out" so we went to our tents. Racheal came
in mine</b>
<br><b>because she wasn't tired anymore so we just talked for a few sec.
Than she</b>
<br><b>needed to go get a lantern at the Dining fly, and she wanted me
to go with</b>
<br><b>her, and when we went out there, the Fire that we were watching
was all up in</b>
<br><b>flames again, so I shined the lantern up to see if someone was over
there</b>
<br><b>that got it going again, and there was no one in sight.</b>

<p><b>Ghost in High Park</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:aejrobin@home.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Our names are Laura and Anne, and we have an experience with a ghost
to</b>
<br><b>share with you.</b><b></b>
<p><b>We live in Toronto, Canada.&nbsp; I am not sure if you are aware
of a park in</b>
<br><b>Toronto named High Park, (largest Park In Toronto, and quite spooky
at</b>
<br><b>night) but we have heard stories all of our lives about their being
ghosts</b>
<br><b>there.&nbsp; One of the most famous ghosts of High Park is Mrs.
Jemima</b>
<br><b>Howard.&nbsp; She lived in Toronto in the 1800's with her husband.&nbsp;
Their</b>
<br><b>cottage was located in High Park (which wasn't a park at the time).&nbsp;
It was</b>
<br><b>on a large piece of land that overlooked Lake Ontario.&nbsp; They
built it in</b>
<br><b>1837, but didn't live there.&nbsp; There home was in downtown Toronto.
After Mr.</b>
<br><b>Howard retired they decided to move into their cottage, and added
parts on</b>
<br><b>to it so that it was more like a home.&nbsp; It was the first home
in Toronto to</b>
<br><b>have an indoor toilet (the door was covered with wallpaper, so guests</b>
<br><b>wouldn't be turned away by seeing an indoor toilet, because at the
time</b>
<br><b>people thought it was unsanitary).&nbsp; Their home was called "Colborne
Lodge"</b>
<br><b>named after a man who helped the Howards out. Later on in Mrs. Howard's</b>
<br><b>life she became very ill (with breast cancer) and didn't leave the</b>
<br><b>house.&nbsp; Her husband put her in a "sick room", which apparently
was what</b>
<br><b>they did at that time.&nbsp; Her room was off to the back of the
house, and in a</b>
<br><b>way this became her "new home".&nbsp; At night she would wander
off because she</b>
<br><b>was taking many different medications that would make her a little
"out of</b>
<br><b>it" you could say.&nbsp; Mr. Howard decided to make another door
about 5 feet</b>
<br><b>away from her room that had no handles so she couldn't leave (he
didn't</b>
<br><b>want her to wander off into the woods anymore).&nbsp; So at this
time, she never</b>
<br><b>left her room.&nbsp; Her husband decided to build her tomb, because
he knew that</b>
<br><b>she would die soon.&nbsp; Legend has it, that he made her watch
him build it</b>
<br><b>from her bedroom window.&nbsp; It seems cruel, but at that time
that was</b>
<br><b>something that was done so the person could cope with dyeing easier.&nbsp;
Mrs.</b>
<br><b>Howard died in the 1870's and Mr. Howard remained in the house and
died in</b>
<br><b>1890.&nbsp; People always said that they would see lights on in
Mrs. Howards</b>
<br><b>room, and that they would see the figure of a lady standing by the
window</b>
<br><b>(looking out towards her tomb).&nbsp; All of these sightings took
place at</b>
<br><b>night.&nbsp; Later on the house was considered historic (because
Mr. Howard</b>
<br><b>founded High Park), and people would take tours of the house and
it's</b>
<br><b>vicinity.&nbsp; Many visitors to&nbsp; the home claimed to feel
"cold spots" near</b>
<br><b>Mrs. Howards bedroom, and the feeling of someone watching them.</b>
<br><b>Now for our experience.</b>
<br><b>My friend and I have always wanted to go by Colborne Lodge at night,
just</b>
<br><b>to see if we would see anything unusual at the house or near the
tomb</b>
<br><b>stone.&nbsp; It was about 3:00am, and we decided to drive through
High Park and</b>
<br><b>find the house.&nbsp; It took us about 30 minutes because we weren't
sure of</b>
<br><b>where it was exactly, and trying to find something in High Park
can be like</b>
<br><b>trying to find a needle in a hay stack because it is so large.&nbsp;
It is even</b>
<br><b>harder to find something when it is so late at night, because it
isn't very</b>
<br><b>well lit (which is why we think it's a little spooky).&nbsp; At
about 3:30am we</b>
<br><b>found a street named "Colborne Lodge Rd", and turned onto it.&nbsp;
We drove</b>
<br><b>down the road for a bit and spotted the house.&nbsp; I parked the
car by the</b>
<br><b>back of the house, where&nbsp; you can see the window in Mrs. Howards</b>
<br><b>bedroom.&nbsp; We were a little bit weary because we parked right
between the</b>
<br><b>house and the tomb.&nbsp; My friend and I don't scare very easily,
but that</b>
<br><b>night we were in for a surprise.&nbsp; I turned the car off and
we just watched</b>
<br><b>the house.&nbsp; We noticed a light on in Mrs. Howards bedroom and
the room</b>
<br><b>beside it.&nbsp; After a few minutes we saw what looked like a woman
walking by</b>
<br><b>the window, and then stopping and looking outside.&nbsp; We got
a little nervous</b>
<br><b>and drove away.&nbsp; After trying to calm down (which took about
5 minutes), we</b>
<br><b>decided to go back and see what was going on.&nbsp; We knew that
nobody was in</b>
<br><b>the house.&nbsp; There are no occupants so the lights shouldn't
have been</b>
<br><b>on.&nbsp; We thought that maybe one of the tour guides had forgotten
to turn the</b>
<br><b>lights off, but that still didn't explain the woman inside.&nbsp;
We parked</b>
<br><b>between the house and the tomb again, and turned the car</b>
<br><b>off...waiting.&nbsp; The light was still on, but this time it went
off and then</b>
<br><b>back on.&nbsp; We could still see the woman in the window and then
she was</b>
<br><b>gone.&nbsp; After about 2 minutes or so, we heard what sounded like
someone</b>
<br><b>walking towards the back of the car.&nbsp; I turned around to see
who it was,</b>
<br><b>only to see the outline of a woman.&nbsp; Then there was tapping
on the back of</b>
<br><b>the car, which then moved to tapping on the passenger side window.&nbsp;
We</b>
<br><b>freaked out and I started the car.&nbsp; My head was down because
I was putting</b>
<br><b>the car into drive and my friend was watching me, screaming for
me to</b>
<br><b>drive.&nbsp; We both looked up, only to see this same figure standing
in front</b>
<br><b>of the car.&nbsp; We took off down the road and left the park.</b>
<br><b>The next day we decided to go back to the park during the day, so
we could</b>
<br><b>take a tour.&nbsp; We told the tour guide about what happened, thinking
that he</b>
<br><b>would think we were crazy.&nbsp; He said he had never seen anything,
but that</b>
<br><b>many people have said they could see Mrs. Howard in the bedroom
window.&nbsp; We</b>
<br><b>told him which room we saw her in and that the light was on.&nbsp;
He told us to</b>
<br><b>say no more, and that when we got to that part of the tour he had
a story</b>
<br><b>for us.&nbsp; After going through the main floor of the house, we
went upstairs</b>
<br><b>to where the bedrooms are.&nbsp; He told the story of Mrs. Howard
(the story I</b>
<br><b>told above, of her illness and being kept in the room).&nbsp; He
then instructed</b>
<br><b>us to look around the room, to see if we could notice if anything
was</b>
<br><b>missing.&nbsp; Everything looked normal.&nbsp; It looked like a
bedroom from the</b>
<br><b>1800's.&nbsp; There was an oil lamp by the bed, and a dresser, etc.&nbsp;
The thing</b>
<br><b>that was missing was that there was only an oil lamp...an oil lamp
that</b>
<br><b>never gets lit.&nbsp; There are absolutely no light fixtures in
the room.&nbsp; When</b>
<br><b>they started to allow people into the home for tours, they wanted
to keep</b>
<br><b>it as authentic as possible.&nbsp; So how was the light on?&nbsp;
Perhaps Mrs. Howard</b>
<br><b>lit the lamp herself.&nbsp; We aren't sure, but what we are sure
of is that we</b>
<br><b>saw Mrs. Howard in her bedroom and a figure of a lady by our car.&nbsp;
Also,</b>
<br><b>later that night (around 12am), we went back to the park to see
if the</b>
<br><b>lights were on again....they were, and the same lady was standing
by the</b>
<br><b>window.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Ghost in My Backseat</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:mojobee@eagnet.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hey everyone, I have been lurking here for months but haven't posted
yet.I have had a lifelong interest in the paranormal and I have sporadic
psychic ability myself. Sometimes I know things that will happen (as my
very southern mother says we "just know it for sure") but it is never anything
important that I know beforehand. Also I cannot call on the ability but
it comes to me.&nbsp; I have had many experiences which I may share later.
Anyway, I want to talk about what happened last night. My parents and I
were in the car going to the store. I was driving, my mother was in the
backseat, and my father was in the passenger seat. The radio was off, but
my mother heard a male voice singing. However , she could not make out
the words. My father was not singing. I asked Mama if she wanted it to
stop because she was sure that someone was in the backseat with her. She
said yes so I did a binding, one I read somewhere online about "old Tom
Parker, under your hat, bound in the name of God the Father, God the Son,
and God the Holy Spirit" and it stopped. My father was scared by the binding
more than the ghost. Now I feel bad, because I wonder who it was. My grandfather
is close to death and I know family sometimes contacts you when someone
is about to die. But my mother was scared and I didn't think it was a good
idea for a presence to be scaring us while we were flying down the road!&nbsp;
I know I cannot ask it back because you are not guaranteed to get the same
one but I will always wonder who it was. We live in south Georgia in what
is supposed to be the second oldest city in the U.S. The town is chock
full of ghosts, and I even sometimes lead an informal ghost tour of the
historical section at night. Anyway, thanks to all for your stories and
I will post more of mine when I have time.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Ghost Sighting</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Neil@rush35.freeserve.co.uk</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I was 14 years old when I first 'played' the Ouija Board with my
brother and sisters. We played it for almost 5 years and within those 5
years some very strange things occurred....</b>
<br><b>The first strange 'happening' occurred when I was 15. I had placed
my school shoes beside my bed ready for the following day. When I woke
up the next morning my shoes were found in the cupboard behind my bed which
could only be opened after my bed had been moved out of the way. I cannot
imagine anyone moving my bed without disturbing me. From that day on I
slept with my youngest sister in a different room.</b>
<br><b>The second 'happening' occurred in a different part of the house.
There were strange noises coming from underneath my sisters bed, but there
was nothing to be seen. Then one night not long after I was at the bottom
of my sisters bed when I looked at the window and saw a figure which resembled
a small child, sat with its legs crossed and hands on its hips looking
straight down at me. I turned over thinking to myself this is not real,
it will not be there when I turn back, but it was. It stayed there for
as long as I was looking. I did not dare move, scream or close my eyes.
Eventually I fell back to slepp burried underneath the covers.</b>
<br><b>My 18 year old daughter does not like going upstairs as she says
it feels cold and seems like someone is standing at the top of the stairs.
I am 40 years old and still ask my mother to accompany me when I go upstairs.</b>
<br><b>I still think there is something in that house which I am very afraid
of.</b>
<br><b>Thank you for taking the time to read about my experience.</b><b></b>

<br><b>"Ghost" Stories</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: vaunsquash@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>O.k., first of all, I am not one to jump to the conclusion of "ghosts"
when hearing or seeing something out of the norm. I'm skeptical, so to
say. However, there have been two incidences in my childhood that I have
trouble explaining.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;The first, took place in my house in shilo, Manitoba. (Shilo
is a small military town.) I was very young when "it" happened. Maybe four
or five. This is why I have to wonder if it was simply my young imagination,
or if I did experience something. Well I was laying asleep one night, soundly
as ever, and I awoke -abruptly, not to mention- to a figure of a female
the end of my bed. At least it seemed like a female. Now that I think about
it, the only clue to it's gender was it's long hair. And from some of my
male friends, I know this isn't always a reliable source. Anyway, this
thing...it, wore bright white. Almost like it wasn't wearing clothing,
but light itself. I was terrified, of course. I tried to close my eyes,
but it made no difference. I could still see this bright figure, seemingly
hovering, over the end of my bed. It -whatever it was; ghost, angel, whatever,
simply observed me; wearing...robes. Not really a dress, just bright robes
benignly hanging from it's figure. I tried to scream, and found myself
unable to speak. My mouth moved soundlessly. And after what seemed like
a lifetime, The figure disappeared. I am not sure what went on after this,
I only remember what I have written, and even then I have doubts to my
accuracy, due to the age I was. The more I think about it, the more I am
convinced this figure was an angel. What it was doing at the end of my
bed, this is still a mystery to me.</b>
<br><b>The second is much more clear in my mind. I was roughly ten, maybe
eleven. This took place in Victoria, B.C, where I am living now. Once again,
I had been living on an military compound. (My father was in the military)
Near the compound, is a golf course. In the center of the golf course,
is a cemetery. Anyway, every evening, just before dusk, my best friend
and I would go to collect the stray golf balls that the golfers neglected
to gather themselves. We would then give them to my father, who enjoyed
not having to go and buy new golf balls himself. He too had hit his fair
share of golf balls into the bush, never to be seen again. Anyway, out
we set for our evening stroll in the forest, gum boots on, egg carton on
one hand (for holding the golf balls.) sweater in the other. - it had been
raining&nbsp; nearly ceaselessly for the last week or so. The evening progressed,
and regretfully, my friend and I had not had a very fruitful evening and
had only collected one or two balls. (Perhaps because of the rain; the
course was more of a sponge pit, and any unfortunate golfer brave enough
to tread on the grass found him self ankle deep in wet mud and grass.)
Out of desperation (or an obsessive compulsive habit, beats me...) we decided
to stay a little longer and see if we could find any balls in the bushes
nearer to the graveyard. I was getting dark, and still we searched for
more golf balls. It was nearly dark now, and both of us were getting more
and more apprehensive, hanging around a graveyard at night. We decided
to split up, stay for five more minutes, and then go home.&nbsp; I went
towards the trees facing the cemetery, my friend a little farther off to
the left.&nbsp; I was scanning the ground, when something caught my eye,
just off to the right. In a tree. Next to the graveyard. I innocently gazed
in the direction of movement and saw a figure, a human figure, hanging
- swinging - from an old oak tree. It must have been 20, 30 feet high in
the air. It would have been, in my opinion, very hard to climb up that
tree. I took no time in sprinting away from this ...thing... swaying in
the breeze,&nbsp; and ran towards my clueless friend. I stumbled up to
her, white, trembling, and skittish. (As she had described it years later.)
I had told her what I saw, and she insisted on seeing it too. We both gingerly
peered from the bushes toward the gnarled old oak. The figure was still
there. Swaying. She, after her quiet chatter about how much of a 'scaredy
cat' I was, went&nbsp; suddenly silent. We stood there for around a minute
or so. And looking at each other, sprinted home. I told my father about
this, and he, like so many others, took our story for the fanciful imagination
of children in the dark. Both of us went back the very next dawn, and went
to go investigate "the" oak. The branch was there, but no person. I occurred
to me that for anyone to hang themselves, or for someone to be hung, there
would have to be some tracks leading to and/or from the tree. My own boots
had been nearly sucked into the earth a few times. And I only weighed 80
lbs or so . Something must of occurred to my friend too, because all she
would say was, "that wasn't a person. It was something else." I too had
a feeling that the situation we had witnessed the night before was not
a typical hanging. That night was the last of our golf ball collecting
for a very long time.</b>
<br><b>So there you go. Think what you may, but I can say honestly that
whatever happened those two nights, I have never doubted the occurrence
of something abnormal.</b>

<br><b>Bit of a Story</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: lsimson@home.com]</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hi.. I've got a bit of a story...&nbsp; Well, it was a saturday morning
and I was asleep and I heard a LOUD knocking sound. I thought it was my
father so I said (rather irritably) "whaaaat?" but the knocking continued
and after about 2 minutes of this.. I realized the knocking was coming
from my wall! On the other side of the wall was the attic and there was
no room in betweet wall layers for anything to be hiding and knocking.&nbsp;
So I got scared and ran out!&nbsp; Then.. a week or so later, I was sitting
in my room, doing homework when I heard the knocking again! I alerted my
sister and she heard it too.. we both ran off scared.&nbsp; Then I heard
it a third time when I was alone in my room. I took my sisters tape recorder
and recorded the sound.&nbsp; I played the tape for my mom and dad but
they didn't believe me.&nbsp; Then, another weird thing happened in my
room, just last night!&nbsp; I was laying on the floor, listening to my
favorite CD doodling in my notebook (hey... its a 14 year olds favorite
pastime!) and my ankle was resting against my clothes hamper.&nbsp; All
of a sudden, my light flickered. It wasn't the electricity because my radio
kept playing.. then my dirty clothes hamper started swaying and finally
fell to the floor...&nbsp; I did not move my leg to make the hamper fall!
It scared me so badly I ran to my parents room and they did not believe
me!</b>

<p><b>House to Sell</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Morphinehammer@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I was 16 my father bought a 16 year
old house.&nbsp; The house was</b>
<br><b>right across the street from a large cemetery.&nbsp; The first night
that I stayed</b>
<br><b>there I felt a little uneasy and it was hard to fall alseep.&nbsp;
Not that I was</b>
<br><b>scared, but that I was being watched.&nbsp; We moved in right at
the end of the</b>
<br><b>school year.&nbsp; I would spend alot of time home alone watching
TV.&nbsp; The way the</b>
<br><b>TV and couch were postioned you could see the hallway out of the
corner of</b>
<br><b>your eye.&nbsp; I would always see dark shapes glide back and forth
between the</b>
<br><b>bedrooms, but I never got a clear look.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My brothers were about the same age
as me, and my dad worked nights so</b>
<br><b>we had alot of parties.&nbsp; The first time I ever got a good look
at the ghost</b>
<br><b>was at one of my parties.&nbsp; I was walking up the stairs and
right in front of</b>
<br><b>me a older man appeared.&nbsp; He didn't look back at me, he just
walked up the</b>
<br><b>stairs and past everybody at the party.&nbsp; Nobody noticed him
but me.&nbsp; He had</b>
<br><b>on a suit and had grey hair and was bald on the top of his head.&nbsp;
I just</b>
<br><b>followed him up the stairs and down the hall.&nbsp; He then faded
away.&nbsp; I didn't</b>
<br><b>realize that I saw him until after he was gone.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Throughout the next year Id hear
footsteps and he would appear every</b>
<br><b>now and then.&nbsp; The funny thing was I was never scared of him.&nbsp;
Almost every</b>
<br><b>one of my friends who visited alot would have some sort of an encounter,
only</b>
<br><b>their's seemed much more frightening.&nbsp; One of my best friend's
was also my</b>
<br><b>biggest sceptic.&nbsp; He didnt believe that I had a ghost in my
house.&nbsp; One night</b>
<br><b>he was walking into the bathroom and he screamed and ran out of
my house.&nbsp; He</b>
<br><b>would never tell me what he saw.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My friend's would have different
things happen to them.&nbsp; They'd see</b>
<br><b>balls of light or if they were in the bathroom the shower would
turn on by</b>
<br><b>itself.&nbsp; Once at four in the morning my friend heard a very
large crash from</b>
<br><b>the living room.&nbsp; Like somebody had picked up the kitchen table
and dropped</b>
<br><b>it.&nbsp; He ran upstairs to see, and there was nothing out of place
and nobdy was</b>
<br><b>up.&nbsp; Stuff like that.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once I accidently ran over a cat.&nbsp;
I felt really bad so I brought it</b>
<br><b>home and buried it in my garden.&nbsp; The next day a friend and
I were outside</b>
<br><b>playing basketball and he said "There is a cat in your garage."&nbsp;
It was the</b>
<br><b>same cat that I had ran over.&nbsp; It ran out of the garage and
disappeared right</b>
<br><b>in front of us.&nbsp; Needless to say the ground where I had buried
him was</b>
<br><b>undisturbed.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I moved out for about 6 months and
into my mother's house.&nbsp; About a</b>
<br><b>week after living there I saw what looked like the silhouette of
my sister</b>
<br><b>standing in the bathroom with the light off.&nbsp; I asked her why
she had the</b>
<br><b>light off and I turned the light on.&nbsp; There was nobody there.&nbsp;
I thought</b>
<br><b>nothing of it for some reason and I went to bed.&nbsp; The dog would
always come</b>
<br><b>up and sleep at the end of my bed at night, so when I heard footsteps
come up</b>
<br><b>the stairs and come to the edge of my bed I thought it was just
the dog.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>told "it" (thinking it was the dog) to jump up on the bed.&nbsp;
Nothing happened,</b>
<br><b>so I turned on the light and nothing was there.&nbsp; I then heard
whispering all</b>
<br><b>around the room the rest of the night.&nbsp; Thus began an actual
frightening 6</b>
<br><b>months.&nbsp; I would awake in the middle of the night to something
shaking my bed</b>
<br><b>and saying my name.&nbsp; I was in my sisters room talking on the
phone and there</b>
<br><b>was the shadow of a man standing in the corner.&nbsp; He kept walking
up to me,</b>
<br><b>and when I'd turn towards him he'd run back to the corner.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would have visions of what it would
be like to die a tramatic death.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;It was all very strange.&nbsp; Eventually I moved back to
my dad's house.&nbsp; My</b>
<br><b>first night back I heard footsteps around my bed and had the feeling
that the</b>
<br><b>old man's ghost was happy to see me back again.&nbsp; For the next
few years the</b>
<br><b>same strange occurences went on.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I bought the house from my dad a
couple of years ago.&nbsp; I lived there</b>
<br><b>by myself, but the activity had died down alot.&nbsp; Just when
I'd think my</b>
<br><b>ghostly friend had left he'd make an appearence.&nbsp; My girlfriend
moved in and</b>
<br><b>he had alot of fun with her.&nbsp; He'd do perverted things like
grab her butt or</b>
<br><b>snap her underwear.&nbsp; She said that at night alot she would
wake up and see</b>
<br><b>him standing in the doorway watching us sleep.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One night I had a dream about the
old guy.&nbsp; My dad was only the second</b>
<br><b>owner of the house and as far as we new nobdy had died there.&nbsp;
In my dream I</b>
<br><b>talked to the old man.&nbsp; He seemed to have a good sense of humor,
but also</b>
<br><b>seemed very ill at the time.&nbsp; I joked with him about coming
to a party with</b>
<br><b>me and he wanted to go, but I left without him.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon after&nbsp; I started getting a feeling
of evil coming from my house.</b>
<br><b>I knew that the good ghost was still there, but I felt like there
was</b>
<br><b>something in my basement.&nbsp; It would wait for me when Id come
home and greet</b>
<br><b>me at the door.&nbsp; I think what really pissed it off was that
I wasn't too</b>
<br><b>afraid of it.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I lived in the house a total of 8
years and spent two years living</b>
<br><b>there alone.&nbsp; I moved out and sold the house about a month
ago.&nbsp; There is</b>
<br><b>something in the house where I live now, but I dont think that it
is the same</b>
<br><b>person.&nbsp; I get the feeling that it is a woman.&nbsp; She hates
my cats and</b>
<br><b>torments them.&nbsp; Other than that I dont know what else to say.&nbsp;
Why do you</b>
<br><b>think that this man hung around me for so long?&nbsp; Why did this
evil presense</b>
<br><b>suddenly appear right before I sold the house?</b>

<p><b>Mom and Dads Story</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: HappyFace33124@aol.com</b>

<p><b>Hi!&nbsp; I have been on your website numerous times and i think
its great!&nbsp; First</b>
<br><b>off, i wasn't born when this happend and my mom and dad told me
this story.</b>
<br><b>I think that they have alot of better things to do than lie to their
own</b>
<br><b>child.&nbsp; Anyway,&nbsp; they lived in Philadelphia.&nbsp; One
night my mom, dad and</b>
<br><b>sister(who was about 12 at the time)&nbsp; came home around 8:30
after attending</b>
<br><b>something at the church with my sister.&nbsp; All of a sudden, a
black figure</b>
<br><b>swept across the room and dispersed into the basement.&nbsp; My
mom and dad both</b>
<br><b>saw it.&nbsp; My sister did not, but if she had she would have seen
its face.&nbsp; So</b>
<br><b>my mom and dad never wanted to talk about it again figuring no one
would</b>
<br><b>believe them.&nbsp; My grandmother had the house blessed and nothing
seem to go</b>
<br><b>wrong. So years go by and then i was born.&nbsp; My dad was at work,
my sister at</b>
<br><b>school and i was only a few weeks old.&nbsp; My mom then worked
at home and I was</b>
<br><b>sleeping upstairs in my crib.&nbsp; She started to think about her
good friend</b>
<br><b>because she was pregnant and was wondering what she had and then
all of a</b>
<br><b>sudden she heard a beautiful voice and the voice she that her friend
was okay</b>
<br><b>and she had a baby girl.&nbsp; So, she got up and looked around
to see if anyone</b>
<br><b>was there and no one was.&nbsp; Two days later her friend calls
my&nbsp; mom and said</b>
<br><b>she had a baby girl.&nbsp; But this house was no ordinary house.&nbsp;
One time, my</b>
<br><b>parents were digging up the driveway and they found 2 tombstones.&nbsp;
dated back</b>
<br><b>to WW1.&nbsp; And the basement had a dirt floor, a chair with handcuffs
on the</b>
<br><b>walls, a red light and incense.&nbsp; Of course my parent s got
rid of everything.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;We moved out of the house in 1990 and we go visit it every
once in a while.</b>
<br><b>It still feels like there is something there but who knows, it could
all be</b>
<br><b>in my head.&nbsp; Thanks for taking the time to read this!</b><b></b>

<br><b>Tree House</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: paulk.brown@home.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I thought after reading other accounts of the
unexplained I would share my own experience.I grew up in a small town in
middle Tennessee outside the city limits what many consider country.While
it was somewhat isolated there were neighbors around with children older
than myself.Our house sat at the end of the road and our property joined
a large farm that belonged to Mr.S and his family.I was about six or seven
when this occured .Being the hyper kid I was I was always exploring the
woods&nbsp; Mr.S had on his farm.In one area ther was a tree house that
had been there for a long time( I was told by others) anyhow I wasn't allowed
to go there when the older kids were hanging out there.A few months earlier
my sister had told on me to my mom that I was smoking with the older kids.Well
needless to say I was very careful not to let on when I was intending to
visit the tree house.I remember I left the house early one saturday morning
it was the fall of in 73 or 74.I headed towards the woods to the forbidden
tree house.It was quite a trek for a little snot like me, however; since
it was a place off limits I went there every opprotunity I had .This paticular
saturday I finally reached my destination and was getting ready to climb
up when I happend to look up directly into the face of a smiling young
man! "Whoa!" I jumped back and said,"you kinda scared me" the young man
looked down at me a sorta laughed."I didn't mean to scare you " the fellow
said.He then proceeded to tell me how he had built the tree house years
before and that he liked to come back ever so often to see it.I stood at
the bottom of the tree looking up at him . I remember that he had sandy
brown hair and was wearing,wire rimmed glasses,flannel shirt,green army
pants,and boots&nbsp; seen.I especially remember his smile,it seemed to
glow so bright it was hard to take my eyes off him ! He kept talking although
I dont remember what all he said but, one other thing that I vividly remember
is that I could see the under side of his boots.Looking up from below I
saw that the soles of his boots were black and sticky it was like he had
been walking in hot tar or molasses .As soon as this came to my attetion
I looked at the steps to the tree house and saw them dripping with this
black goo.He seemed quite amused at my discovery and started to snicker
at me .It was then I realized I was holding on to the bottom rung with
both hands firmly implanted in the goo! The sudden wave of nausea that
gripped me was overwelming I started gagging and wanted to throw-up as
I bent over I raised my hands to my face and was horrified!! My hand were
covered with this vile blackish and red pieces of tissue.As I stood there
disgusted and confused I heard the fellow in the tree laughing, loud at
first then sounding further and further away.The next moment I looked up
to&nbsp; the young man he had vanished! Needless to say I almost killed
myself hightailing it out of the woods towards home.The distance between
home and the tree house seemed miles away and I made record time! As soon
as I entered my yard I went for the garden hose I had to get that hideous
goo off !! When I reached for the water I noticed that the offending matter
was gone no sign of it anywhere on me or my clothes!!</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The experience I discribed stayed
with me for quite awhile however; time eventually eased me into playing
off the happening as an over active imagination.I believe I was able to
store this away because I relly didn't want to ever think about it again.A
few years went by and I was mowing yards during the summer for neighbors
and freinds.The neighborhood had grown considerbly ,the woods where the
tree house was now a really nice wooded subdivision.One afternoon I had
just finished my mowing and was headed home.I had some time and decided
to be charitable(more my fathers idea I must admit). There was an older
house where the grass always needed cutting.My father said old farmer Mr.S
(who had passed away a few years back) elderly sister lived there and I
should offer to cut her yard.I knocked introduced myself and told her why
I was there.Well after I'd finished she invited me in for a drink of water.While
inside she and I started talking when I noticed a frame of military medals
on the wall.I have always been a history buff especially the military.Knowing
she was a widow I asked her if the medals were her late husbands she said
they were and went on to tell me about him.She told me what her husband
had done in the war and about their life together.I had noticed she seemed
not to think very much of the army even though her husband had a very distinguished
career.While talking I told her I assumed having a husband in harms way
during war was probally very stressful .At that moment she said for me
to follow her that she show me why she had such a dislike for the military.I
followed jer to a room and when she opened the door I couldn't beleive
what I saw.There was a room straight out of the sixties.This room had posters
of cars ,airplanes,and a diploma on the wall.The lady proceeded to tell
me about her son who after high school joined the Marines and was killed
in Vietnam.She slowly closed the door and we walked to the front door.I
stammered around for something to say ,thankfully; she changed the subject
telling me she would pay me for cutting the grass.I steadfastly refused
payment so she grabbed me and hugged me.Hugging back my eyes closed I slowly
opened them looking over&nbsp; her shoulder into the living room .It took
just a second for me to focus on the photo of a young man in uniform the
same young man from my youth! The same young man who had died years before
,the same young man I had seen in a tree house he had built .The same young
man who was sitting in his tree house wearing bloody boots, back from a
war he did not survive.</b><b></b>

<br><b>True Story to Tell</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: triple_C@edgemail.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hi my name is Jen and I have a true ghost story to tell.&nbsp; I
was about ten, and it had been exactly a year since my grandfather had
past away.</b>
<br><b>My oldest sister finally got her own room for her birthday.&nbsp;
She was bothered by some voices in the bathroom early that morning so she
asked me to sleep with her in her room for a little while.</b>
<br><b>One week had went by and she still had me sleeping in her room.&nbsp;
There had been suspicions before about ghost in my house, but never hearing
any voices. I didn't believe her about the voices because I didn't want
to believe it, and there was nothing to prove it, I have never herd voices
in this house only noises and things like TV's being turned on and off.
Which I told myself was just a power problem, not to scare myself, But
I was indeed to find out for sure myself that there was a ghost living
in my house.</b>
<br><b>It was late at night when I felt a cold breeze cross my legs sending
chills up my whole body.&nbsp; I didn't know where this cold breeze was
coming from, I knew that I shut the window before going to bed, because
of having no screen. Out of the corner of my eye I saw something white
swirling in the air. Even though I was scared I looked anyway.&nbsp; I
felt stupid, only to find that it was the curtain blowing. But wait, I
thought how did the window get open?</b>
<br><b>I was to scared to get up to close it so I lye there cold and scared.
I then turned to my sleeping sister for comfort pulling the covers tightly
to my chest and pressed against her.&nbsp; I lay there still trying not
to even breath, WHAT WAS THAT! there was pressure on the bed as if some
one had decided to join me.&nbsp; Out of curiosity I turned my head to
see what was sitting with me. It was my grandfather. At least that's who
I think it was, just staring at me with his head resting on the bed his
hands folded.&nbsp; I was scared out of my mind, but at the same time I
was speechless and I couldn't scream!&nbsp; I just sat there and watched
him. His lips moved but nothing came out. By the time I was able to scream
and get my sister up he was gone.</b>
<br><b>I prayed never to see him again!&nbsp; and I haven't, but my brother
claims to have seen him twice once again beside me.&nbsp; And each time
he has been on my left side, even the time I saw him.&nbsp; Some say he
is trying to tell me something or warn me about my bad heart, others say
it's a coincidence.&nbsp; I don't know it remains a mystery.&nbsp; Along
with the mystery of the little girl my sister herd giggling in bathroom.&nbsp;
Lots of other mysterious things have happened in that house with no explanation
why,</b>

<br><b>Ghosts?</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: RSSMITH20@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Many years ago, when married to my first husband, (married 3-64--divorced</b>
<br><b>7-76), in the last few years something in black would stand at the
foot of</b>
<br><b>the bed, he was working the 3rd shift at the time, and just stand
there, and</b>
<br><b>other times, it came to side of my bed, and would call my name Ruth,
very</b>
<br><b>quietly.&nbsp; This happened many times.&nbsp; My sister, 13-14
yrs. at the time, was</b>
<br><b>sleeping with me, and she knew something was happening when I would
sit up</b>
<br><b>and sometimes scream, or just be scared to death and not do or say
anything.</b>
<br><b>This happened once before we were married,&nbsp; I was bathing and
something in</b>
<br><b>black appeared to me.&nbsp; I told Mom, she said I must have doing
something bad</b>
<br><b>with my then boyfriend (and we were having sex).&nbsp; This is the
same man I then</b>
<br><b>married and the black figures started many years later again.&nbsp;
What were</b>
<br><b>they.&nbsp; With this same man, I saw an extremely tall man walk
past our window</b>
<br><b>in the porch and just stared in at me.&nbsp; My ex-husband could
tell every time</b>
<br><b>when I saw something, although he never saw anything.&nbsp; I have
had many many</b>
<br><b>strange things happen to me in my life, and most recently, with
my now</b>
<br><b>husband of 10 years, during extremelly hard bad family times, we
both had</b>
<br><b>someone call our names at work, turn to see who itwas, no one was
there.&nbsp; It</b>
<br><b>does not happen now since the problems are gone..well we hope they

<p><b>Good and Evil Entities</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: legendblonde@yahoo.com.au]</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hi, my name's Karolina and I live in ACT, Australia. I</b>
<br><b>believe that I may have had my first experience with</b>
<br><b>an evil entity (as opposed to my many with other</b>
<br><b>ghost/entities and strange experiences, which were not</b>
<br><b>necessarily evil).</b>
<br><b>A few days ago I was really tired so i decided to go</b>
<br><b>to bed early. I turned off all the lights and checked</b>
<br><b>my alarm clock (I live alone) and my cat jumped into</b>
<br><b>bed with me and started on his catbath routine. I</b>
<br><b>don't remember falling asleep (I was lying on my back</b>
<br><b>with my arms on my stomach), but the next thing I</b>
<br><b>know, I feel like I'm being lifted or levitated up,</b>
<br><b>horizontally, roughly a metre above my bed. The first</b>
<br><b>thing I thought was "oh, it's a flying dream, cool".</b>
<br><b>I often dream of flying and I do enjoy the</b>
<br><b>experiences. Suddenly I realised that I was not flying</b>
<br><b>through my own will power, and something just felt</b>
<br><b>very wrong. I "willed" myself to go back down to the</b>
<br><b>bed but I was still being "levitated" and was almost</b>
<br><b>in a vertical position now. I could only move my eyes</b>
<br><b>and my head slightly, so I looked to the right and saw</b>
<br><b>the streetlight shining through the blinds and thought</b>
<br><b>"OK, I should be safe, I am at home". I didn't feel</b>
<br><b>safe at all though, and started to panic somewhat. I</b>
<br><b>called on all my guides to send me "good" energy (I</b>
<br><b>study Wicca) to come to protect me and help me, and</b>
<br><b>kept concentrating on willing myself to be in complete</b>
<br><b>control of my body. After a little while I felt myself</b>
<br><b>go back down, and my immediate reaction was to get up</b>
<br><b>and calm myself down. That's when I realised that I</b>
<br><b>could not move. Something or someone was holding me -</b>
<br><b>I was completely paralysed. I really started panicking</b>
<br><b>then and I thought if I can't use my limbs, I will use</b>
<br><b>my mind and my voice. In my mind I screamed (the way</b>
<br><b>you scream if you were attacking someone), and</b>
<br><b>although I only heard a whimper come out of my mouth,</b>
<br><b>suddenly I could move. I sat up, not knowing whether I</b>
<br><b>had been asleep, dreaming or in an awake but</b>
<br><b>semi-concious state. What scared me most was the fact</b>
<br><b>that I couldn't tell what state I had been in, that</b>
<br><b>the experience felt so real, and that the cat was</b>
<br><b>still in my room giving himself a catbath. It had only</b>
<br><b>been minutes.</b>
<br><b>At the moment I don't think I physically levitated,</b>
<br><b>but almost was forced by something evil into some type</b>
<br><b>of astral travel. I am really not sure, as I'm still</b>
<br><b>coming to terms with it. The presence I have in my</b>
<br><b>house at the moment, seems to be (perhaps?) an elderly</b>
<br><b>lady or somebody who keeps on going around cleaning or</b>
<br><b>rearranging my things. I can hear sounds (almost every</b>
<br><b>second day) as if someone is picking up the newspapers</b>
<br><b>and wiping the table underneath, or laundry is being</b>
<br><b>moved. I can also hear footsteps as they busily walk</b>
<br><b>around. It doesn't scare or bother me at all. When the</b>
<br><b>presence first appeared at my house a few weeks ago, I</b>
<br><b>was laying in my bed one night, listening to it, when</b>
<br><b>suddenly it poked me in the side of my face (quite</b>
<br><b>roughly). That night I told it that I was happy to</b>
<br><b>share my house with it, as long as it didn't hurt or</b>
<br><b>scare anyone. I haven't had any problems with it</b>
<br><b>since, although it never felt like a frightening type</b>
<br><b>of presence in the first place. Has anyone else had</b>
<br><b>experiences like this?</b><b></b>

died when she was 13 and it left her very upset.A year later, she went
out to a party with some friends.Her cousins were due to stay so her mum
let them sleep in my mum's room.When my mother got back, her mum told her
that her cousins were sleeping in her room and that she could sleep downstairs.My
mum set up a bed in the lounge, made herself comfy and settled down. Within
an hour, she heard a noise. The lounge double doors opened suddenly.Then
she heard muffled footsteps like someone walking on the carpet, but no-one
was there! Then, something blew on her face, like her dad used to do to
wake her up in the mornings when she was little. Next the ghost sat down
in her dad's armchair, then disappeared. After, her mum, sister and my
mum moved house. When her mother was alone in the new house, pictures placed
on the lounge wall would switch places. My mum still receives visits from
her dad, like when she's reading at night she will say "Give me a sign
you are there" and sometimes,her lamp flickers!!!</b>

<p><b>Growing Up in an Old Farmhouse</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Johndeanna512@cs.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I've always wanted to tell someone other than family and</b>
<br><b>close friends about the experience that my brothers, mom and I had.
I was</b>
<br><b>about seven years old when&nbsp; we moved into an old farmhouse.
On the first</b>
<br><b>night was when weird things started happening. My brothers and I
slept</b>
<br><b>downstairs for the night until the rest of the bedroom stuff got
unpacked. It</b>
<br><b>was late in the night and we all woke up hearing somebody walking
around</b>
<br><b>upstairs. We woke up our dad and he grabbed the shotgun and went
up. He came</b>
<br><b>down angrier than ever saying that there was nothing up there and
that the</b>
<br><b>windows were locked too. After a few weeks the sounds of someone
got more and</b>
<br><b>more current. The walking started at the bottom of the stairs going
through</b>
<br><b>my bedroom and into my brother's room and stopping infront of my
twin</b>
<br><b>brothers bed. When it reached his bed it would start all over again.
One</b>
<br><b>night I was getting ready for bed and I leaned over to turn the
box fan on</b>
<br><b>and it turned on right high before I touched the knob! There was
no other way</b>
<br><b>to turn it on. I ran downstairs like a bat out of hell and my mom
was in the</b>
<br><b>tub. I told her what had just happened and she brushed it off&nbsp;
saying that it</b>
<br><b>was nothing. Us kids had an old radio and at night the spirit would
flip</b>
<br><b>through the stations. Over time my mom started to notice things
going on. My</b>
<br><b>brothers and I took ma by the hand and brought her upstairs and
sat her down</b>
<br><b>on my brothers bed. We told her to be still and not say a word.
The walking</b>
<br><b>started and coming up the stairs and walking through my room and
it stopped</b>
<br><b>right infront of her. My mom's eyes looked like they were about
ready to pop</b>
<br><b>out! She finally believed us kids. The house had a back deck with
an inner</b>
<br><b>deck door and an outer deck door. Many of times the doors would
just start</b>
<br><b>banging and nobody would be around and no breeze. The outer door
had a</b>
<br><b>sliding lock to it and the chain part of it would start to pick
up like</b>
<br><b>someone was picking it up and dropping it. I hated being alone in
that house</b>
<br><b>especially when I had to get around for a softball game. The doors
would all</b>
<br><b>of the sudden start banging and when I'd yell at it to stop it would
for only</b>
<br><b>a few minutes and start all over again. Later on we found out that
a man did</b>
<br><b>die in the house. When we moved out of the house another man moved
in shortly</b>
<br><b>after. He didn't last long, he left in the middle of the night and
didn't</b>
<br><b>take a thing with him. When we lived there our dog refused to come
upstairs</b>
<br><b>with us and even sleep up there.This house is around 200 yrs. old.
That was</b>
<br><b>one of the worst experiences that our family has ever had.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Haunted Holiday Inn-Grand Island New York</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: stteb@home.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Let me start by saying that myself and my family have been going
to this Holiday Inn for almost 30 years for holidays.&nbsp; It has become
tradition, first my parents taking me, and now I'm taking my children.&nbsp;
We had no idea that it was haunted, or that the graveyard beside it is
said to be haunted as well.&nbsp; Last year, while frequenting this site,
I ran across a story about the Holiday Inn written by one of the ladies
who clean the rooms.&nbsp; In it she told the story of a little girl, I
believe her name is Tanya, who haunts the rooms and corridors of the hotel.&nbsp;
Well, we just thought that was too cool, and the past few times we've gone
to the Holiday Inn, I've kind of taunted the ghost, with little "Tanya,
where are you?" kind of things.&nbsp; Well, last year we had a small incident,
and this year I had one, only 2 nights ago, that terrified me beyond belief
and cemented my belief in ghosts once and for all (up until 2 nights ago,
I had been a skeptic who wanted to believe but really couldn't bring myself
to think that ghosts were real).&nbsp; Last year, while watching "Gladiator"
on the Lodgenet satellite movies, while we were all sitting in plain site
of the open closet space, a hanger simply jumped off of the rack and fell
to the floor.&nbsp; Now, there was nothing else hanging there, and no one
had been around the hangers.&nbsp; As you know, hangers cannot simply fall
off of the rack.&nbsp; They need some kind of assistance.&nbsp; Well, that
was kinda cool, but it wasn't what one would term a definitive supernatural
experience.</b>
<br><b>Well, this year, at least for myself, the experience was definitely
definitive.&nbsp; We decided to walk around the cemetery at dusk, and take
along a camera to take random pictures of ourselves and the cemetery, in
the event that we might capture something on the image (if anything shows
up, I'll send a picture of it in).&nbsp; Well, nothing happened while in
the cemetery, and we went back to the hotel and ordered a movie.&nbsp;
After the movie everyone went to sleep.&nbsp; I was in one room with one
of my children, while another of my&nbsp; children, my nephew and my mother
(grandma likes to travel with the kids on occasion) slept in the adjoining
room.&nbsp; It was 4:00 in the morning when my fun began.&nbsp; I had woken
up earlier, at around 3:30, and felt slightly agitated, but nothing worse
than that.&nbsp; At 4 I awoke again, and my first thought was "Oh my God,
something's really happening."&nbsp; I was terrified beyond reason, and
I couldn't move a muscle or make a noise.&nbsp; I quickly opened my eyes
in time to see the torso of a black figure move away from my side of the
bed and quickly move down to the foot of the bed.&nbsp; I couldn't make
out any feature, size or age or sex or anything like that.&nbsp; From my
laying position, all I could see was it was&nbsp; a black shape and it
moved away quickly.&nbsp; I know it said something to me, but I couldn't
remember what it was.&nbsp; I remember fear like I've never felt before,
and I tried to move and to scream, but I couldn't do either.&nbsp; Now,
I'm a 250 lb man, and I'm not exaggerating when I say that I'm not easily
frightened.&nbsp; In fact, I can't remember the last time I was scared.&nbsp;
Suddenly, the entire room, that I could see from my side in the&nbsp; bed,
went all crazy, kind of hard to explain, but it was like a Hollywood special
effect, where the entire image on a screen is twisted and bent, and then,
with a start, I could move again.&nbsp; At first, I was still too gripped
with fear to move, but after a minute or two I did, and there was nothing
in the room.&nbsp; I still was completely terrified, and couldn't shake
the feeling that I wasn't alone.&nbsp; I turned on the light, and slept
with it on the following night in the hotel room again (the first time
I've ever needed to have a light on for sleeping in my entire life).&nbsp;
The following night, in the hotel room, nothing happened, and I felt no
agitation or fear.</b>
<br><b>A small side note to this story.&nbsp; Shortly after midnight, in
the other room where my mother slept with the two other children, somebody
rapped heavily on the door four times.&nbsp; She jumped out of bed and
called to me that someone was at the door, but I didn't wake up.&nbsp;
She darted to the door, but no one was out there.&nbsp; The really surprising
thing about this is that I didn't hear either it or her yelling at me.&nbsp;
I slept right through it.&nbsp; I'm a single dad, and have been for almost
11 years, and I never even sleep through one of children's sneezes in another
room, so the fact that I didn't hear heavy pounding on the door or someone
loudly calling out to me in a quiet room at night is incomprehensible.</b>
<br><b>Thanks for reading this story, I know it doesn't hold the kind of
gut wrenching terror that other stories on this site have, but it is one
hundred percent true, and proof for me beyond a shadow of a doubt of life
after death.&nbsp; Plus, it's probably going to keep me up at night for
awhile.</b>

<p><b>Haunted Home in North Carolina</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: osjpa46@allstate.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I used to be such a skeptic when it came to "ghost stories" and other</b>
<br><b>stories of the like, but when my family moved into a little house
on a dead</b>
<br><b>end road, all that changed.&nbsp; The small house was built by a
man that we</b>
<br><b>referred to as "Bill" for his wife as an anniversary gift.&nbsp;
He hauled all</b>
<br><b>the wood himself and apparently put a lot of work and love into
giving her</b>
<br><b>the home of her dreams.&nbsp; When we moved in, there were some
discoveries that</b>
<br><b>startled several of the landscape crew.&nbsp; The first discovery
was after they</b>
<br><b>had tore down the chicken coops, they discovered Items of clothing
buried</b>
<br><b>all around a small house that we later used for storage.&nbsp; They
then decided</b>
<br><b>to go through that little storage building to see if there would
be anything</b>
<br><b>of value there so they could plow it down.&nbsp; The small storage
house had a</b>
<br><b>little attic and when one of the men went to explore he found bones
that are</b>
<br><b>still to this day unidentified.&nbsp; One of the bones that was
particularly</b>
<br><b>disturbing, it looked like the bone of a human leg, but when examined
by the</b>
<br><b>local police dept.&nbsp; they explained that much of that land was
farm land and</b>
<br><b>it was probably that of a horse or cattle.&nbsp; They scheduled
the leveling of</b>
<br><b>the ground right after the reports for the bones were released in
case the</b>
<br><b>local law enforcement would like to investigate the area..the area
had been</b>
<br><b>vacant for such a long time, it was hard to tell who had been poking
around</b>
<br><b>down there.&nbsp; The day of the leveling came and almost immediately
they began</b>
<br><b>to have problems with the equipment.&nbsp; A blade off of a big
industrial lawn</b>
<br><b>mower flew off and almost seriously injured one of the crew.&nbsp;
We decided to</b>
<br><b>just repair the little house&nbsp; and just use it for storage since
the cost was</b>
<br><b>beginning to raise for the crew was going to have to stretch out
the</b>
<br><b>leveling for another week due to the equipment problems.&nbsp; After
all the</b>
<br><b>repairs and remodeling our family moved in to what we thought was
an</b>
<br><b>incredible find.&nbsp; Everything about this little house was antique
and we</b>
<br><b>couldn't figure out why anyone had not even shown an interest in
remodeling</b>
<br><b>it and making it their own.&nbsp; We soon found the answer to that
question.&nbsp; It</b>
<br><b>started out as friendly little pranks, like when my younger brother
was late</b>
<br><b>getting in the porch light would turn on, and if you would sit on
the couch</b>
<br><b>you could see a shadow of a man in a rocking chair rocking ( we
didn't own a</b>
<br><b>rocking chair), TV's would change, radios would turn on.&nbsp; We
just thought of</b>
<br><b>him as a family member and moved on.&nbsp;&nbsp; It wasn't until
I was about 18 that</b>
<br><b>things began to turn bad.&nbsp; My mother and I had went to do the
grocery</b>
<br><b>shopping and came home to my father sitting outside on the porch
pale as a</b>
<br><b>sheet.&nbsp; We went inside to discover that the TV was on full
blast, all the</b>
<br><b>alarm clocks were playing, and the answering machine was playing
it's self</b>
<br><b>over and over again.&nbsp; The really strange thing was that ALL
the clocks were</b>
<br><b>set back 2 hours.&nbsp; At first we thought it was a power outage
and it caused</b>
<br><b>everything to go nuts, but we then discovered that the clocks were
not</b>
<br><b>blinking as if reset, and even my mother's collection of miniature
clocks</b>
<br><b>were set back and they ran on watch batteries.&nbsp; Again we chalked
this up to</b>
<br><b>one of "Bill's" little pranks.&nbsp; About a month later my parents
decided to</b>
<br><b>take a vacation and my brother had went to camp.&nbsp; I was all
alone for a</b>
<br><b>week.&nbsp; I decided to spend the night in my parents room since
they had a more</b>
<br><b>comfortable bed than I did.&nbsp; The window to their bedroom faced
the little</b>
<br><b>house.&nbsp; I was lying there watching TV and I heard shuffling
coming from the</b>
<br><b>little house.&nbsp; It sounded as if someone was moving furniture
around just</b>
<br><b>assumed it was a cat or stray dog since there was so many in the
area.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>then saw a light come on and that is what terrified me, there was
no</b>
<br><b>electricity in the little house so there is no way there was a light
on down</b>
<br><b>there.&nbsp; I thought either someone had broken in or perhaps "Bill"
had taken</b>
<br><b>to a new house to haunt.&nbsp; I called the police and they found
nothing.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>calmed myself down since our ghostly friend had never hurt anyone
and</b>
<br><b>decided to take a bubble bath to help me sleep.&nbsp; While in the
tub I heard</b>
<br><b>the shuffling again and just turned the music up.&nbsp; It was when
I got back</b>
<br><b>into the bathtub that the door of the bathroom flew open, slammed
shut, and</b>
<br><b>something I could not see was trying to push me down into my bath
water.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>could feel big hands pushing me down, but nothing was there.&nbsp;
I jumped up,</b>
<br><b>called my friend to come get me and refused to stay another minute
in that</b>
<br><b>house alone.&nbsp; We moved out of that house about 6 months later
when similar</b>
<br><b>incidents began to happen to all of us.</b>

<p><b>Haunted</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: donvelo@osprey.net</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a child, I lived in a small, two bedroom trailor
in Eastern Kansas. I would often wake up in the middle of the night, hearing
voices. My bedroom was opposite of the bathroom in the trailor, so i would
have to walk through the house to get to the bathroom.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quite often, when i would walk through the living
room at night, i would see two women and a little boy standing there. I
would here them whispering things to me, but i could never make out what
they were saying.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One night, I actually saw the little boy outside
my window, riding an old scooter in the street. My mother went outside
to investigate and saw nothing, but as she stood there and told me so,
i still saw him.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was only about 7 at the time, but i found out
a couple of years ago, that back in the early 70's, a tornado had ripped
through the trailor park, killing 3. A mother and her son and another lady.
On the exact corner my mother lived on.</b>

<br><b>Pengersick Castle</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Suziemillar@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>Description of Haunting:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I participated in a paranormal
investigation at Pengersick castle, Cornwall, which is more like a fortified
farmhouse with a three storey tower which was beautifully structured in
1480 with eery looking turrets. We were accompanied by our 2 mediums Marion
goodfellow and Paul Hanrahan, who through trance&nbsp; discovered the building
was haunted by a Richard of Pengersick. Later to be proven was a real life
charector in 1312( il explain discrepancy in dates later). He came through
Maz vocally (which was a first for Maz) and was a very powerful and brutally
violent man. At one point he (through maz) swept his arm crossly, across
the table knocking a metal cup off onto the floor, and then proceeded to
demand that paul(who was asking the questions) pick it up, snarling at
him.Then a man called James came through, he was the man servant and said
he had been lashed 10 times by Richard ( who he only referred to as the
master)for spilling the boiled water which a pantry maid had just heated,
burning himself badly on his right hand in the process.He said he slept
with the dog and when asked why? he replied where sire would you have me
sleep, in the stable? During the same sceance a women whose relationship
with Richard was undetermined came through.Her name was Elenor who was
reluctant but sweet of tone, said they had a daughter called Catherine.
Later I discovered they were of the same blood and were having an ancestuous
affair.The weird thing was that they lived before the actual castle was
built but upon research I discovered that the granit stone of which the
castle is comprised, was previously used to structure the previous dwelling,
a manorhouse which had stood, a little further up from the where the castle
stands now. My question is why do they only seem to haunt the castle and
not what was obviously there own dwelling place/land.Could it be that the
granit some how carries their spirit within it? i don't know, aaany other
theories?..... We discovered a Monk who is, it appears is the custodian
of the land. He has been seen by many locals and even Mrs Evens the owner
of the castle.One eye witness account by a close neighbour says, I awoke
one night, it must have been about 4am as it was just getting light, to
find what looked like a monk, standing at the end of my bed, he continued,
it was quite profound really because instead of being frightened as you
naturally would, I felt a feeling of calm, the figure whose discription
matched that of a cistercian monk stood gazing for about 10 mins then just
disappeared......I witnessed our professional dowser Rod Beckly, communicate
with this monk after encountering his pressance during our tour of the
grounds. Using his selfdesigned rods I watched dumbstruck after a series
of questions, the rods led us to a sacred piece of ground which he seems
to protect. Later mrs evens said that a church lay half buried under the
soil and she hoped to get herritage approval (even though it is her land,
apparently they are about to put an embargo on the place)) to dig it up
and try to some how restore the unearthed flooring, this building goes
as far back as possibly 1200AD. Proof is written in the doomsday book of
a chapel but it doesn't say where on the acres of Pengersick land it lays........
I also witnessed with my own eyes a mist form above the tudor bed matress,
it was strange because I could see clearly beneath it and it was clear.
So we prepared another sceance and discovered it to be haunted by a child
of thirteen called catherine,ah ha i hear you say, we were suprized too,
but not as suprized as we were by the next peice of info.Catherine was
encaged within the castle walls because she, it was said, had been inflicted
with the devils mark, a large deep red birthmark on her face. The archive
showed she had been visited on several occasion by the local priest who
believed she could be freed from the devils clutches. Many witnesses have
claimed to have seen the face of a child at the window on the second floor(this
the bedroom,mist?)wrapped in some kind of shroad only partially showing
her face. catherine fell to her death while dancing upon the turrets aged
13.....</b>
<br><b>I found this next experience very uplifting. As I walked the grounds
with the dowser, we came to a spot where the energy was very strong, I
felt a presence which I felt was watching me. I asked the dowser to see
if I there was indeed something there.To my astonishment there was. We
were then lead (via the rods) to a small gap in the trees, where the grass
grew thick and full and was told to stand there very still, my whole body
began to tingle and I felt like I was floating. I was compelled to ask
questions regarding the spirit. She discribed herself as the wise one and
her ancestors had lived their since 700 BC,she said she was the last descendant
and she died in 1861. very difficult to proove through archive but metal
detector findings prooved that the ground had been used by people in the
bronze age. Tools had been found relating to that era. The strange thing
was after the dowser had completed the search the mediums done the same
tour, which I for obvious reasons wasn't allowed to accompany. They described
seeing a small women with a huntched back in the same area.....They also
found what they discribed as an unsacred burial ground, holding up to 20
bodies, the archive does mention the area quarentined in the late 1600
because of the plague, of course servants wouldn't have been buried in
the local church and would have almost certainly been buried on the land.
Crying and moans have been heard by the gardner and other nearby residents,
comming from the wooded area. Could this be grieving family/co-workers
of the lost souls who were so inhumanily slung into a mass grave? will
we ever find out?.... My team and I photographed several orbs using a digital
camera within the rooms of the castle. There has been alot of contraversy
over the orb theory but after having watched the mediums pointing to where
they can physically see the orbs and then getting them on camera I am quite
convinced that what we are seeing are the energy forms of what remains
of human spirit.Of course I don't come to that conclusion easily, our investigations
team have done a mountain of experiments to&nbsp; try to repoduce these
orbs using dust of various forms, smoke ect even bubbles and an array of
different light sources and&nbsp; nothing comes close to the real thing.&nbsp;
Other stories which we didn't have time to investigate were the Tunnels
which lead down to the coast just a&nbsp; mile away, where the Pengersicks
were accused of wrecking and smuggling(Folklore until prove, nothing in
archive, hmmm wonder why?). One tunnel found by the dowser finished its
course right outside the very front of the castle. Mrs Evens explained
she had thought it was a dissused well and upon aquiring the property filled
it in and is making plans to unearth the entrance once again.Apparently
a very old local women, who, in her youth, played at the entrance of the
tunnel, which was and to local knowledge still is in a cave just of the
cove of praa sands. she is still alive now. People including tourists have
seen strange lights comming from the beach at the dead of night. Could
these be the lanterns of pirates and the Pengersicks hiding their loot?</b>
<br><b>Our investigations continue but I can't wait to encounter some real
polterguist activity for myself and my team which really will test our
wits and I guess our bravery.Hope you enjoyed reading one of my most recent
and enjoyable&nbsp; investigations.we continue to search and proove. Suzie.

<p><b>The Neighborhood Ghost</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Agentcurlyfry3@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hello, i am eric, i live in NC in a neighborhood known for its hauntings
and unusual happenings.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My story begins at my house, one
of the most active houses in our area. It was about 2 weeks ago, and i
was just getting ready for bed.&nbsp; the night efore i had heard some
very unusual noises, some of which scared me half to death. At the time
that i was just falling asleep, (11:30), i began to hear the same exact
noises as the night before. i knew what i was hearing, but i chose to annoy
it. After about 10 min.s of hearing this, i decided it was time to investigate....
i was previously into ghost hunting, so i had most of the equiptment. i
was investigating for about half an hour when i realized that nothing was
happening at all, so i tried to go back to bed.. the instant i got in my
bed, my door flew open..i screamed my head off, and stood up, at this time
the door was not moving, but i was feeling unusually cold. i tried to ignore
this but it was impossible, I was so cold i couldnt bear it anymore...
i then started hearing a cracking noise next to me.. and i looked over
starteld, and my window crashed down and broke. I was so scared i ran outside
and woke up my neghbors, and for some reason, ever scince, i have not seen
or heard anything unusual.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Haunting Verified</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: cinsation@americainter.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have posted twice before to your site (Haunted
Since 5 and Devils</b>
<br><b>Den) and just had to update you on the status of my home.&nbsp;
On May 11,</b>
<br><b>2001 there were six experienced paranormal researchers in my home.&nbsp;
They</b>
<br><b>set up video equipment, audio equipment and had various other tools
of</b>
<br><b>the trade handy.&nbsp; I knew there were spirits in my home before
they</b>
<br><b>started their research, I just didn't know how many and who they
were.</b>
<br><b>I was aware of at least two different ghosts and knew there was
possibly</b>
<br><b>a third.&nbsp; Well, let me tell you, all three were verified that
night,</b>
<br><b>plus we found a vortex that began in the basement and traveled all
the</b>
<br><b>way up through to the top floor.&nbsp; This was determined using
an EMF</b>
<br><b>meter.&nbsp; The temp gun also fluctuated crazily in this area.&nbsp;
Now let me</b>
<br><b>tell you, I was not thrilled to discover this vortex.&nbsp; The
researcher in</b>
<br><b>charge assured me that the entities in the vortex have to be called</b>
<br><b>through to this side.&nbsp; Is this true?&nbsp; I am currently waiting
for Ken to</b>
<br><b>finish editing the video.&nbsp; I can hardly wait to see the results.&nbsp;
We did</b>
<br><b>capture a picture of the little girl on film, I saw it myself and</b>
<br><b>finally got to see what the little one looks like that sits on my
lap</b>
<br><b>while I am reading the stories on here.&nbsp; I have a number of
pics that</b>
<br><b>were taken with digital cameras that night.&nbsp; It was amusing
that the</b>
<br><b>researchers had to keep replacing the batteries in their cameras.&nbsp;
I'm</b>
<br><b>not sure which one was present when I was upstairs with two of the
team,</b>
<br><b>( I was taking temp readings), but Ken had placed a piece of yarn
on the</b>
<br><b>ceiling fan to determine when something was stirring upstairs while
we</b>
<br><b>were downstairs.&nbsp; Ken, Amy and I were doing the readings when
Amy said,</b>
<br><b>"Look!" Ken and I turned to see the ceiling fan slowly rotate the
string</b>
<br><b>towards where we were standing.&nbsp; I wouldn't have thought a
whole lot</b>
<br><b>about it except that the fan turned the blade the opposite way of
its</b>
<br><b>normal rotation.&nbsp; Talk about freaky!&nbsp; It was my first
encounter with one</b>
<br><b>who had moved something before my very eyes.&nbsp; I wasn't afraid,
but</b>
<br><b>rather totally excited.&nbsp; Before I forget, there were three
spirits</b>
<br><b>identified in my home that night. One was the little girl I had
been</b>
<br><b>calling Madlyn, Tiff seems to get the name Elizabeth tho when she
speaks</b>
<br><b>to her, one was that of my late husband James, (I knew he was there),</b>
<br><b>and then there was one named Charles.&nbsp; The little girl was
not</b>
<br><b>comfortable with this last spirit, yet she and my husband got along</b>
<br><b>fine.&nbsp; I will send the photos along to the other link for photos.&nbsp;
There</b>
<br><b>is one in particular that bothers me.&nbsp; It is a large blue orb
with a</b>
<br><b>face in the middle.&nbsp; It is at the feet of Ken as he takes a
picture of</b>
<br><b>the cheval mirror my husband had given me one year for Christmas.&nbsp;
You</b>
<br><b>can see a bit of the flash in the top of the mirror so I know it
isn't</b>
<br><b>the flash, and the orb shows up again in another picture upstairs.&nbsp;
In a</b>
<br><b>couple of the pictures, a pair of hands can be seen in the mirror
of an</b>
<br><b>old vanity I bought at a flea market.&nbsp; They look as if they
are in</b>
<br><b>prayer or covering the nose and mouth of someone sneezing.&nbsp;
The only</b>
<br><b>reason I got any sleep at all that night (about 3 hrs) was because
I had</b>
<br><b>graduation the next day, otherwise I wouldn't have slept at all.&nbsp;
I have</b>
<br><b>recently moved from that house and am now living in Georgia.&nbsp;
I do</b>
<br><b>believe I have a resident spirit here in addition to that of my</b>
<br><b>husband.&nbsp; As soon as I do a little more research on this particular</b>
<br><b>place, I will send a new update.&nbsp; And since I am now living
within a few</b>
<br><b>miles of a major Civil War battlefield and in line of where troops
were</b>
<br><b>marshaled and marched through to the battle, there is lots of activity</b>
<br><b>not of this world.&nbsp; I love it!&nbsp; Hey, thanks again for
a wonderful site.</b>

<p><b>He wore Obsession for Men</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: john_aud@msn.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For five years I lived in a little appartment
that I apparently shared</b>
<br><b>with a roomate that I couldn't see.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the day I moved into the appartment
with my two small children, I</b>
<br><b>felt a presence.&nbsp; At first little things would appear.&nbsp;
A 22 caliber bullet</b>
<br><b>on my kitchen counter top.&nbsp; Coffee cup from the Sands Casino
in Vegas.&nbsp; A</b>
<br><b>towle that wasnt mine.&nbsp; The weirdest was a brand new "farmer's
see and say"</b>
<br><b>toy that magically appeared on my children's bedroom floor on my
two year</b>
<br><b>old's birthday.&nbsp; At the time, I had just moved in, I rarely
had people over</b>
<br><b>so these items would't have belonged to a friend.&nbsp; I didn't
have a gun.</b>
<br><b>Never had been to Las Vegas.&nbsp; I had no linens when I moved
in, I had bought</b>
<br><b>all new matching towles.&nbsp; All were green or wine, this towle
that appeared</b>
<br><b>was white and old.&nbsp; I had never seen it before.&nbsp; I had
asked everyone I knew</b>
<br><b>if they had bought the toy for my two year old. No one claimed responsiblity</b>
<br><b>for it.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I began to "feel" as if someone was there
with me.&nbsp; Especially when it</b>
<br><b>was late at night and the children were in bed sleeping.&nbsp; The
hair on my</b>
<br><b>neck would stand up and I would turn to look at the door way to
my</b>
<br><b>livingroom, expecting to see someone walk in.&nbsp; I could hear
the floor boards</b>
<br><b>creek.&nbsp; I would feel a stirring in the air.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The presence was unmistakably male.&nbsp;
After a few months of moving in,</b>
<br><b>he would announce his self with the over powering sent of Obsession
for Men</b>
<br><b>colone.&nbsp; It was very strong.&nbsp; I thought I was going nuts.&nbsp;
I thought perhaps</b>
<br><b>I was imagining it.&nbsp; Untill a friend came over to see my new
place.&nbsp; We were</b>
<br><b>sitting in the cozy livingroom drinking coffee.&nbsp; I was telling
her about the</b>
<br><b>weirdness and the Obsession for Men smell.&nbsp; Suddenly, the room
filled with</b>
<br><b>the smell.&nbsp; My friend got very scared and began to cry.&nbsp;
She creeped out and</b>
<br><b>left.&nbsp; I was oddly amused at his timing.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I felt strangely safe with him there.&nbsp;
As if he was there to protect</b>
<br><b>me.&nbsp; I know, sounds stupid but that's what I felt.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As time went on, I grew used to him there with
me.&nbsp; Then I began to</b>
<br><b>date the man who is now my husband.&nbsp; Things began to change.&nbsp;
I began to</b>
<br><b>feel a different presence.&nbsp; This one was angry.&nbsp; Scary.&nbsp;
It would seem to</b>
<br><b>hang out in my bedroom.&nbsp; In my closet.&nbsp; I'd hear the coat
hangers moving.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>would hear a weird whirling sound at night.&nbsp; Things would dissapear.&nbsp;
I</b>
<br><b>began to dread going to bed.&nbsp; He'd pace the hallway as I tried
to sleep.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My boyfriend and I got married, he went
back to his home state to get a</b>
<br><b>job, a appartment and then come back to collect the children and
myself.</b>
<br><b>This was a horrible time for me.&nbsp; The angry presence seemed
to get worse.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>could no longer sleep in&nbsp; my room.&nbsp; I'd lay awake, staring
at the door way,</b>
<br><b>fully expecting to see a male silhouette standing there.&nbsp; It
got to the</b>
<br><b>point where I had to sleep on the livingroom sofa.&nbsp; Sometimes
I'd feel it</b>
<br><b>peeking at me from around the corner of the hallway, in the darkenss.&nbsp;
I</b>
<br><b>began to sleep with the lights on.&nbsp; I began to feel that there
was two</b>
<br><b>distinct personalities in the appartment with me.&nbsp; One was
Mr. Obession and</b>
<br><b>the other was just creepy and mean.&nbsp; Or perhaps it was Mr Obession
and he</b>
<br><b>was mad at me for some reason.&nbsp; I wasnt sure which.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, my husband came to get us.&nbsp;
He had been there for a few days.</b>
<br><b>We hadnt began to pack yet.&nbsp; We slept in the bedroom dispite
my feelings of</b>
<br><b>dread.&nbsp; I told my husband what I felt.&nbsp; That something
was there with us and</b>
<br><b>wasn't happy with me or perhaps us.&nbsp; He thought I was being
silly.&nbsp; That</b>
<br><b>night I turned in early.&nbsp; He stayed up watching TV in the livingroom.&nbsp;
I</b>
<br><b>layed in bed, looking out my bedroom door where I had a clear view
of my</b>
<br><b>husband on the sofa.&nbsp; My cat came up on the bed with me and
I pet him.</b>
<br><b>Suddenly I felt the hair on my body stand up.&nbsp; My cat jumped
to it's feet</b>
<br><b>and the hair on it's back stood up.&nbsp; His eyes were fixed on
the doorway.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>swear to God, I felt "him" standing there, in my doorway.&nbsp;
Ten feet from me</b>
<br><b>at the most.&nbsp; Laying down, my field of vision was partially
blocked.</b>
<br><b>Althoug I could see into the livingroom, however I could not see
the bottom</b>
<br><b>third of the door way.&nbsp; I heard a dragging, slidding sound.&nbsp;
Like something</b>
<br><b>smooth was being dragged across the carpited floor.&nbsp; A "Ssssssshhhhhhhhhhh"</b>
<br><b>kind of a sound.&nbsp; My cat jumped off the bed and took off running
for the</b>
<br><b>livingroom.&nbsp; I layed there. straining to listen to the sound,
trying to</b>
<br><b>figure out what the hell it could be.&nbsp; Just then, in the livingroom,
my</b>
<br><b>husband got up.&nbsp; He turned off the livingroom light and was
walking down the</b>
<br><b>darkened hallway towards our bedroom.&nbsp; I could see his silouette</b>
<br><b>approaching.&nbsp; Just as he got to the doorway he hit something
and tripped</b>
<br><b>over it.&nbsp; He hit the floor and began cursing.&nbsp; He&nbsp;
turned on the light and</b>
<br><b>there wedged in the doorway was one of my children's toy chests.&nbsp;
I was now</b>
<br><b>really scared.&nbsp; I told my husand that "it" but it there but
he denied that,</b>
<br><b>one of my children must have done it.&nbsp; yeah, my four year old
belly crawled</b>
<br><b>from the room next to ours pushing a toy chest ahead of him just
to wedge it</b>
<br><b>in our door way.&nbsp; He wouldn't have had the strenght to do it,
or a reason</b>
<br><b>to.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A few days later we moved.&nbsp; I often
wondered what the heck had</b>
<br><b>happened.&nbsp; Did my friendly, protective ghost get angry with
me and turned</b>
<br><b>nasty?&nbsp; Or were there more than one?</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just last month my children who are
now in their preteens, were</b>
<br><b>looking through pictures.&nbsp; They found one from when we lived
in the haunted</b>
<br><b>appartment.&nbsp; It was a Christmas picture.&nbsp; Of the kids
standing in front of</b>
<br><b>the tree holding up some gifts.&nbsp; One each side of them is an
orb.&nbsp; Two orbs.</b>
<br><b>I had never noticed those orbs before.&nbsp; I guess that answered
my question.</b>
<br><b>There were two ghosts.&nbsp; I often think about Mr Obession.&nbsp;
I kind of miss</b>
<br><b>him.</b><b></b>

<br><b>My Lost Old House</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: asteven3@twcny.rr.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over a year ago, my boyfriend and I had the opportunity
to move into a HUGE house, we're talking ten bedrooms here, two kitchens,
and two full bathrooms, and for only $300. a month in rent. Sounds too
good to be true, right? Well, it was.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The house, we later found out was about a hundred
years old. It had a lot of the common architecture of that period, for
our area. Twelve foot ceilings, rooms that were either incredibly wide,
or incredibly long, great big thick wooden doorways, windows about 8 feet
tall and 3 feet wide, and a classy foyer with two huge double wooden doors
that had blackened (with age I guess) metal in fanciful designs.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The house, when we started renting it, was owned
by his boss, who naturally had her restaurant across the street. She had
bought it so she could tear it down and make a parking lot. Well, the town
Mayor lived diagonally across the street and wasn't having that! So, my
boyfriends Boss was at a complete loss as to what to do with the house.
Maybe you are wondering why anyone would want to tear down such a beautiful
house? Well, the house had problems. It had been neglected for about forty
years in its interior upkeep as well as exterior, and in such a multitude
of ways I won't even describe, suffice it to say that the house had a very
sturdy frame, but a roof that needed to be replaced twenty years before
we even got to it.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, for that little rent and so much room, we
figured we could at least make a go of it, and started fixing it up before
we even moved in. A lot of people say that this is crazy behavior for people
who are just going to rent a house. But the house exuded charm with its
high ceilings and darkly framed doorways, it just had a friendly vibe about
it.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I know that that is rather contradicting to the
normal Ghostly experience, but I really felt that the house was thankful
that finally someone cared about it the way it deserved. It had a lot of
promise.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now when I look back to those first months, I
wonder if I made a mistake. When we were still in the painting process
my boyfriend had gone upstairs to check the attic for something, I cant
remember what. When he came back down he had an old family album that the
original owner had just left for rot up there. It certainly wasn't in mint
condition as it had been submerged in water once. But amazingly, a good
quarter of the pictures were in great condition due to the submerging.
You see, the album was made out of a thick cardboard like substance, and
when it got wet, some of the edges of the pages stuck together, basicly
protecting them from air and harm.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I remember gently cracking that album open, and
then pictures of children spilling out. Some had names and dates, the oldest
was over a hundred years old. There were pictures of stern looking ladies,
and fellows decked out in the dress of times long passed. I thought it
was amazing! So, I salvaged what pictures I could, and tried not to feel
bad about the ones I couldn't.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I then tried to get in touch with the original
owner of the house about the pictures, who wouldn't want a piece of their
fami</b>
<br><b>lies history? This is the basic story I got. Her and her husband
lived in this old house for about forty years. They had their children
there, and then their children moved away. About a year before my boyfriends
boss bought the place, the husband had died suddenly (not in the house,
thank god) and the children came over in her time of grief, pawing over
their belongings and fighting over&nbsp; who would take what. I imagine
it was horrible for the poor woman. Anyway, after that she put the house
on the market and waited. Everything that we found in the house was left
because it reminded her of her husband, and she wanted no part of it. The
family photo's she said I might as well just throw away! I was aghast!
I couldn't throw away these beautiful pictures of children who were probably
all dead by now. These prim and proper men and women who had lived and
died. I guess I just have a sense of history.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So you can see that I had a great love for this
house, and it's history, and I put money into it whenever I could. I learned
later through research and hidden cubbies that the house had been owned
by a single older woman, and the many rooms rented out. Then it was turned
into two apartments by the next owner, one upstairs, one down. Then owned
by the lady mentioned earlier.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the longer that we lived there, the more
certain areas of the house would start to feel uncomftorable. When we first
moved in, it was the attic, and the upstairs hall. Just standing there
looking down it could give anyone a serious case of the willies. Then it
was the downstairs kitchen, then the adjoining room to the kitchen. It
didn't feel evil, or even cruel. Just angry like we were invading its rightful
space. I rather agreed with it, there was enough room to share.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But as soon as winter came we had to make serious
adjustments. Our heating bills were outrageous, around $2000. a month for
the whole house. The landlady would not put any money into a new furnace,
and we could barely keep up with our heating bills. So we had to move our
bedroom downstairs into one of the "dark" rooms. This is when things started
to get really bad.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; See, all along there had been strange incidences.
Like our two cats would suddenly chase things upstairs, with a fury and
a speed that I have never seen in them. They would yowl at all hours at
doors they could not get through, hiss at things that they followed with
their eyes, and circle around us when we went into these "dark" rooms or
spaces.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not that I knew it at the time, but both my boyfriend
and I had been having dreams about a woman with long white hair and an
oval shaped face. We always dreampt her in the house, and the feeling was
always one of tolerance, but with an attached warning. The strange part
was that we *always* had them the same night.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes I would wake up in the middle of the
night, terrified that I had just missed something important. Often we would
hear noises downstairs coming from the "dark" rooms, and he would go inspect
to find nothing, or to find the place looking a little ruffled like a strong
breeze had gone through it, and it was never my cats as they slept with
us all night long. They are very protective of us.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I couldn't tell you if it was abnormally cold
in the house. In the winter we were lucky if it was 60 degrees inside.
But in the summer the house was also very cool. (We tried many different
things to heat the house properly, but nothing worked).</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Friends and Family would come over and ask how
I could stay in such a place, with the roof falling in, leaks everywhere,
and those wicked vibes. Everyone was aware of a watchful presence, and
complained, which led me to put up holy symbols in the living room for
company, as well as the kitchen. I didn't dare in the bedroom, I was afraid
of what would happen.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Being in the "dark" room was like being a kid
who had gone somewhere that you know you shouldn't of gone. I always felt
like an intruder, like I was in someone's sacred space. But we had no choice.
It was the dead of winter, and we had holed ourseleves into three rooms,
a kitchen, a living room, and a bedroom. My boyfriend told me we had to
move when the first thaw hit, and I cried. I loved my house, even though
I was nervous being in certain rooms. I had remodeled 5 rooms, but he said
we would be lucky if the roof lasted the winter.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, we made plans to move, and everyday that
I packed up another room I cried. Maybe the house picked up my vibes, because
it did seem to feel mournful.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was then four days to moving, and since I
was not working at that time, I had been keeping odd hours. Sometimes just
walking and looking at the house at all hours. Anyway, it was about 10
pm and my boyfriend insisted that I try to sleep even though It wasn't
even close to my bedtime. I agreed because I didn't want to fight with
him, and I lay down to stare at the ceiling and think about what I would
be packing tomorrow.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It had been only fifteen minutes, and I was still
wide awake. When I heard a voice. It wasn't far away, it wasn't whispering.
It was spoken right in my ear in a commanding tone! It was even at such
a close distrance, that I could feel the insides of my ear coated with
heat-breath. Maybe this doesn't sound so strange, but I have a weird name.
It has four syllables that even my own family can hardly pronounce, much
less say accurately. And this voice had! In fact, the voice was sounded
like a young man, but he had my fathers commanding tone, who is by the
way, very much alive. Instantly I started screaming and I jumped on top
of my boyfriend screaming my bloody head off right to hell! He kept on
screaming "what, what"? But I couldn't reply, because I felt the inside
of my ear and even though the heat-breath was fading, I could still feel
it!</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One hour later and I am supposed to be calm and
relaxed, although I've got a tight hold on my boyfriend, and I've finally
stopped screaming and crying. He's fallen off into a fitfull sleep, and
eventually I do too, I think it is from being so shocked because I swore
I wasn't going to until the sun came up.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That night he dreams of the lady with the gray
hair, and she's chasing him through the heating registers in the house,
threatening to kill him and eat him. She has an oval face, and she wears
a white dress with long white sleeves that blend into her gray hair. He
sees her eyes as black, and he feels in the dream as though he has done
something terribly wrong.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I dream of her too, and she is dressed the same.
Only she is gesturing at the walls and doorways, making me back up through
the entire house as she recites a screaming litany of what, I cant remember.
But her eyes are as gray as her hair, and their power is piercing. I feel
like she's beating my soul. When I awake I am left with shame, and a deep
fear.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, we move, and our first night in our new
house, which we hate by the way, he tells me everything that he was afraid
to of told me then because he worked long hours and I was always home alone.
He didn't want to scare me, but now I wish that he had. Maybe I could have
apologised to her. Maybe, I could have done something...</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am not sure what happened that night. Our even
those last few days. I wonder because when we started talking about moving,
the feelings and the dreams became stronger, and the "dark" rooms a little
more angry. My cousin theorizes that the spirit didn't want us to leave.
That she wanted to have her own space with us staying out of it, but still
fixing up the house to return it to its original glory. I sometimes think
the spirit may have been the independent woman who rented out all those
rooms. But I don't know, I'm no Ghost hunter! :)</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If anyone wants to talk about this, I would love
to hear from you. Sorry my story is not as scary as some of yours, but
it is certainly true.</b>

<p><b>I Have Seen Them</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Sharmanemt26@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am a 17 year old female. And ever since
I can remember I have seen</b>
<br><b>ghosts, and have spoken to them through inmaginable ways. Ever night
before I</b>
<br><b>go to bed I see what is known as a ghost. To me it is a person,
that does not</b>
<br><b>know that they are dead yet.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I see them all the time and I now
follow the wiccan ways. They showed</b>
<br><b>me that I could either help them, or leave them as they are. I really
think</b>
<br><b>that the scarest thing that ever happen to me. Was when I was around
eight,</b>
<br><b>or so... I was sound asleep, when I heard a marble rolling on my
floor. I</b>
<br><b>slowly opened my eyes, and saw that there was a young boy, just
sitting</b>
<br><b>there, rolling the marble back and forth. He looked at me, and disappeared</b>
<br><b>into thin air. So I went back to sleep, thinking it was just a dream
I was</b>
<br><b>having. Then the next night it started again, then I got freaked
out and all.</b>
<br><b>I sat there, and watched him just roll the marble back and forth
for hours.</b>
<br><b>When I realized it wasn't a dream I ran down stairs to my mother.
My step</b>
<br><b>father went up stairs to my room and checked it out, and said that
there was</b>
<br><b>nothing of the sort going on. But I know what I saw, and to this
day I still</b>

12 and</b>
<br><b>i've had&nbsp; a few things happen, but nothing major.</b>
<br><b>When i was two, i cant remember, but my grandma passed away. Later
on, when</b>
<br><b>i was three my grandpa also died. Being so young i didnt really
get what was</b>
<br><b>going on, but i knew grandpa was going away. At his funeral, i saw
him and</b>
<br><b>nanny, they where standing together on grandpa's coffin. i wasnt
sure it was</b>
<br><b>a coffin and was abit confused. they started waving to me and i
waved back.</b>
<br><b>i couldnt understand why nobody else was waving, and my mum who
was standing</b>
<br><b>next to me, was puzzled that i was waving. I know i didnt make it
up cause i</b>
<br><b>remember it like it was yesterday!</b>
<br><b>I was really fond of my year one teacher, she was very spiritual.
Anyway,</b>
<br><b>she made me a doll, it was a beautiful doll and it had like, platted
hair,</b>
<br><b>brown, and brown eyes.</b>
<br><b>Anyway, i was like, 5 or 6. I used to go to my dads shop quite alot
in the</b>
<br><b>holidays, my parents both worked and i guess i was always there.
my sister</b>
<br><b>was at a friends house that day so i was playing out the back by
my self.</b>
<br><b>Anyway i was just playing around, when i looked up and i saw something
move</b>
<br><b>in my dads car. And sitting in the back was a girl, she looked exactly
like</b>
<br><b>the doll that my teacher had given me, platted hair, brown eyes,
and</b>
<br><b>everything! She looked about 7 or 8. I was so scared that i ran
up to my mum</b>
<br><b>and dad and started crying.</b>
<br><b>The next and last thing thats happened to me was, it was a really
hot night</b>
<br><b>and i had my window open and my door was slamming and opening. anyway,
the</b>
<br><b>wind got a little bit chilly, and i woke up. My blanket wasnt on
me, it</b>
<br><b>usually fell off in the night, so i lent over the side of my bed
to get it,</b>
<br><b>but it wasnt there. So i crawled up to the foot of my bed and i
saw it was</b>
<br><b>caught under my door. I have no idea how it could get hooked on
my door, its</b>
<br><b>a mystery! ANyway, as i was furiously, half asleep, trying to pull
it up, i</b>
<br><b>saw a lady. she was wearing a green long dress, it did look like
she was</b>
<br><b>hovering tho. she had beautiful long black hair and she released
the blanket</b>
<br><b>from the door for me. i was so tired i didnt no what else to do
but get my</b>
<br><b>blanket from her and crawl back onto my bed. well, thats all my
storys!!</b>
<br><b>They wernt scary at the time, but sometimes i get scared thinking

yet non of</b>
<br><b>us could remove it from the wall before. we also had a little figure
that</b>
<br><b>moved from the kitchen to the back room, which was wierd because
all the</b>
<br><b>doors were shut! we also had a bottle fall from a shelf but even
though it</b>
<br><b>was thin glass it didnt break and it was in the center of the room,
but from</b>
<br><b>where it fell it should have hit the concreat part of the floor
and it was on</b>

"code 7's".</b>
<br><b>Not everyone survives this surgery. I was used to this fact of life
and this</b>
<br><b>particular night didn't think anything differently from any other
poor soul</b>
<br><b>who didn't make it. After we tried to revive this man for at least
a half</b>
<br><b>hour they finally gave up. We all went about the usual business
of notifying</b>
<br><b>family, wrapping the body, cleaning the room, and finishing all
the</b>
<br><b>paperwork. As I was about to finish my paperwork, the call light
went on in</b>
<br><b>the deceased man's room. I thought it must be a nurse wanting something
- so</b>
<br><b>I said - Yeah, can I help you? What I heard very clearly was a man's
voice</b>
<br><b>saying "Help me". I said "excuse me- can I help you?" And again
I heard very</b>
<br><b>clearly "help me". I then looked at the head nurse who was sitting
near me</b>
<br><b>and asked her to please listen to this. She then took the intercom
receiver</b>
<br><b>and asked "Can I help you? She then stated that somebody was asking
for help</b>
<br><b>in that room. Everyone then ran back to the room thinking that the
man must</b>
<br><b>not be dead. When we got there, he was definately dead, and the
room was like</b>
<br><b>a deep freezer. We all looked at each other and most of the people
left the</b>
<br><b>room shrugging their shoulders. The head nurse who happened to be
Cuban and</b>
<br><b>very Catholic and I looked at each other and I said to her- "I think
he might</b>
<br><b>need help to go on". She did not laugh at me- She said out loud
- Mr.</b>

<p><b>When I was 16 years old ,I was married to this man that said that
his house was haunted by a ghost named Mr. kitchen. I thought this was
strange but I was interested in it. We would talk about the ghost alot
. Then I had my baby and came home something happened that changed my mind
from thinking to knowing that there is a ghost in the house. this is what
happened...</b>
<br><b>One night my baby was not sleeping well and was up at all hours
of the night. I just be in the house for a couple of day from the hospital.
So it was on the uneasy side too . but I was up and taking care of my baby
when I heard foot steps coming down the stairs I thought , Oh my I woke
up someone. so I was waiting for them to show at the bottom , but no one
was there and I knew they reach the bottom of the stairs. I heard them.
So I just went to the bedroom and was feeding the baby and finally got
her to sleep so I went to get into bed and was just lying there when the
rocker on the side of the bassinet started to rock . It scared me so much
I prayed that the baby would sleep all night .</b>
<br><b>When morning came I told what happen to his mother which she said
just tell Mr.. kitchen that he need to leave you alone. she then said loud
Mr. Kitchen stay away from the baby you are scaring her mother. After that
I never felt or seen anything strange again in the house .</b>
<br><b>My baby is now 20 years old and she seems to be attracted to ghost.
She sometimes see them, But she is not afraid of them. Thank you for letting
me tell you this . I'm always wanting to learn and hear ghost stories.

<p><b>I Saw a Ghost Once</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: doddi17@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hi, my name is Doddi and I'm from Iceland.</b>
<br><b>Please bare with my poor english while you read this:</b>
<br><b>About two years ago, i saw a ghost in my bedroom.</b>
<br><b>I was fully awake, but it was dark. I was going to the bathroom</b>
<br><b>one last time before going to sleep. On my way back from bathroom,</b>
<br><b>I felt like someone was watching me, but everybody else were asleep.</b>
<br><b>I laid up in my bed and watch tv. As soon as I turned it off, I</b>
<br><b>couldn't move or breathe and I looked up to see a blurry, tall man</b>
<br><b>standing at the foot of my bed. I looked at him, completely paralyzed,</b>
<br><b>I still couldn't move. This was about ten seconds, but I never felt</b>
<br><b>fear of this man. The window in my room has hooks to "lock" the
window</b>
<br><b>and the were not fastened that night. When the man disappeared the</b>
<br><b>hooks in my window made a clinging sound, just like he had passed
through</b>
<br><b>there.</b>
<br><b>My two sisters and mother have also encountered this. My mom just
couldn't</b>
<br><b>move for about ten second, but she has never seen anything.</b>
<br><b>My oldest sister felt someone stroking her back once, with no one</b>
<br><b>around. She has never seen anything either.</b>
<br><b>My second oldest sister saw this man. Her room was next to a kitchen</b>
<br><b>in the house. She had two little birds in a cage (parrots of some
kind),</b>
<br><b>and she always kept them near the kitchen sink, because they were
noisy and</b>
<br><b>messy. One night she felt paralyzed and saw this tall man appear</b>
<br><b>in the corner of her room. He just stood there and did nothing,
just</b>
<br><b>like when I saw him. 2 seconds after he disappeared, the parrots
in the</b>
<br><b>kitchen across the hall started screaming, and they never make a
noise when</b>
<br><b>it's dark, just this once.</b>
<br><b>We have three cats. My second oldest sister (21 years) can't go
to</b>
<br><b>sleep unless she has one of them with her. She's very psychic and
she never</b>
<br><b>feels any presence when the cat is with her.</b>
<br><b>So we know that this ghost is not a huge cat fan.</b>
<br><b>He has never done any harm.</b>
<br><b>It's like he's just observing us, only appearing at the exact right</b>
<br><b>timing.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Cold Spot</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: KMyers@republicbank.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have recently gotten involved in paranormal investigations.&nbsp;
I find it very exciting and the more you bring it up. the more people speak
out about experiences.&nbsp; I never doubted that we walked around here
by ourselves, but I had never had any experiences of my own.</b>
<br><b>Back in May, I was preparing to go to N.C. to see family.&nbsp;
I got up, finished packing and got on the computer to look at some ghostly
websites while waiting on my sister to come and pick me up.&nbsp; My mom
got curious about finding information about her father's death online.&nbsp;
The more we searched for articles, the colder I got.&nbsp; I had on jeans,
a t-shirt, and socks.&nbsp; I felt like I was turning purple.&nbsp; Mom
got a jacket out of the closet for me and all she had on was a night shirt.&nbsp;
Remind you, this is in May, in KY.&nbsp; It gets really warm here.&nbsp;
We couldn't find anything about her father's accident that took place the
1950's, so we just went back to some other sites about ghosts.&nbsp; Before
my sister and I left for out trip, we took pictures of each other with
our mom.&nbsp; When I got my pictures back, I realized why I may have been
so chilly that morning.&nbsp; There were orbs, really good orbs, in about
four of those pictures.&nbsp; One of the pictures that had my mother in
it, there was a really big orb on her, and inside the big one was two smaller
ones.&nbsp; But why was I the one that was so cold.&nbsp; I've been told
that I am relatively sensative because lots of pictures of me down through
the years appear to have activity.&nbsp; I don't know.</b>
<br><b>This is a fascinating hobby for me and I encourage everyone to get
in touch with their "spirits".&nbsp; I wonder if Oprah would do a program
about that?</b><b></b>

straight at my head.&nbsp; I started panicking and told Abby and Autumn
to turn around and look.&nbsp; When they turned, they couldn't see the
man, although he was standing in plain view.&nbsp; Suddenly he pulled the
trigger.&nbsp; Even though the bullet should have hit me, nothing ever
did. I hadn't even seen one coming.&nbsp; Then as suddenly as he was there,
he disappeared in thin air.&nbsp; Autumn and Abby were confused, because
they had heard the shot, but hadn't seen the man.</b><b></b>

<p><b>It All Started</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Luke</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
My frightful experiences started occuring no less than 4 months ago in
my dads house.</b>
<br><b>My dad moved away to Woking when my mum split up from him and although
my dad has lived in the house for years, It has only just started happening.
My first experience was on Boxing day when i was up in my room. (I have
a pullout bed so it is easy for people to hide behind it)&nbsp; while i
was gathering my clothes a piece of chalk came flying from behind the sofa
and hit me in my face.I was sure it was my brother messing about so i thought
nothing of it and peered round. To my horror, nothing was there. Not my
brother, not no one. I ran down stairs as fast as i could and told my dad
. Of course, he didnt believe me.</b>
<br><b>nothin happened for weeks until things started to go missing, like
the headrest for the sorna , and then appear in pretty obvious places which
we'd already looked in. My dad and his Girlfriend would joke about saying
it was a ghost, but i was and still am sure it is.</b>
<br><b>The weirdest incident was when my dads girlfriend was at work and
my dad was in his car driving to his friends. That ment nobody was in.Then,
Annas (my dads girlfriend) work got a phone call from the house which then
hung up. Anna then rang my dad on his mobile to tell him what had happened
and my dad shot bask to the house, but of course, no one was there.</b>
<br><b>Other things that have happened is scratching on the toilet door(
We do have a cat, but everytime anyone pears out of the toilet there is
nothing there) Strange noises fill the room when im trying to sleep, shivers
go down my spine from time to time. I am sure this is a ghost.</b>
