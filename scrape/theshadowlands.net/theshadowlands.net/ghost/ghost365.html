<p class="MsoNormal">By: sprootles@hotmail.com </p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I saw the listing for <st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Cottey</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType>College</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> on the Haunted Places
listing.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I was a student at <st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Cottey</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType>College</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> from 1988-1990
(CSC'90!)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During my time there I had
several different experiences.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Originally, Rosemary Hall was a three story building with an auditorium
on the first floor and two floors of suite style dormitories on the second and
third.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At some point the upper two
stories of Rosemary Hall became structurally unsound and were used to house
props and costumes for the drama department.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When I toured the campus as a prospective student an acting class was
actually still meeting on the second floor, despite the desintigrating plaster
ceilings occassionally falling around them.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">When I finally came to campus my roommate, who was the
costume mistress for the drama department, told me all about Vera, the ghost of
a young woman who died of serious burns while at Cottey.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Supposedly, Vera was making candy in her dorm
room, which was against regulations, when her long skirts caught fire.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was badly burned and moved to the
infirmary which was, at that time, located in what is now known as Main Hall
(Rosemary Hall and Main Hall </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">were once connected).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Vera died due to the seriousness of her injuries.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">do have a book about the history of the college and its
founder and Vera's death is mentioned briefly, but nothing more.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Well, my roommate used to work alone at night in the costume
department sewing costumes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She said she
never felt truly afraid, but heard all sorts of odd noises she could not
explain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It used to be that at <st1:time minute="0" hour="22">10 p.m.</st1:time> all buildings on campus went
automatically onto a keycard system and you couldn't get into any of the
academic buildings unless you had a staff keycard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My roommate had such a card because of her
job.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I used to practice my flute in Main Hall at night in the
practice rooms.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was often dark when I
departed and I had to walk past Rosemary Hall on my way back to my dormitory
(Robertson Hall).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One evening as I was
walking back to my dorm (it was around <st1:time minute="30" hour="22">10:30
 p.m.</st1:time>) I heard the faint tinkling of piano music coming from
Rosemary Hall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There were no lights on
in the </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">building and I knew that my roommate wasn't working late
that night.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">hurried back to the dorm to tell her about it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She said the only piano in the place was
located on the third floor and that it was a very old piano that was barely in
working order and no one ever played it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She also said that she had left the building not more than fifteen
minutes prior and no one else had been in the building.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The next evening me and some of the other girls in our suite
decided we would go to Rosemary Hall and go up to the third floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We snitched my roommate's keycard and let
ourselves into the buildling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was as
dark as a stack of black cats and we had only one little tiny flashlight.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Huddled together we made our way to the
second floor, listening to the groans of the creepy building.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were giggling nervously and grabbing onto
each other out of fear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We made it to
the steps leading to the third floor when we heard a huge crash coming from
above.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All of us screamed in terror and
turned to flee in the darkness, making it down the steps without barely touch
our fee to any of them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When our hearts
started beating again, one of the girls decided she was going back up to see
what was going on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Another girl decided
to go with her, but the rest of us had had enough and went back to our
dormitory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the two girls returned
they said that something creepy had happened but wouldn't say exactly what it
was.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">They tore Rosemary Hall down the summer before my second
year at Cottey.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No one knew they were
going to do this...we simply came back and it was gone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Some say that the ghost of Vera moved to Rosemary Suite in
the same dormitory where I lived (Robertson Hall).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>None of the girls we knew in that suite ever
had any encounters with any spirits in their suite.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I lived in Southeastern Suite on the third floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At night we would lie in bed and could hear
heavy scraping sounds across the attic floor above us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">We tried to get up into the attic to see what was going on,
but were always shooed away by the cleaning lady, through who's closet the
entrance to the attic was located.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
our suite we had things flying off dressers without any warning, too.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">One night, a bunch of us were stupid and decided to play an
Ouija board in the suite.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We kept
getting visited by this spirit called Doza.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She made some pretty harsh remarks about what would happen to us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I got agitated and never played Ouija again,
however, the other girls did.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
supposedly made contact with several different spirits.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The Haunted Places listing also mentioned the spectre of a
Dark Man on the campus, possibly looking for Vera.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This spectre was never mentioned to us while
I was a student there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I doubt if he is
looking for Vera as there is no history that was ever told relating a dark
spectre to Vera.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It wouldn't surprise
me, however, if there were several entities roaming that campus.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Indeed the whole area around <st1:State><st1:place>Nevada</st1:place></st1:State>,
<st1:State><st1:place>Mo.</st1:place></st1:State> is alive with paranormal
energy.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">We used to go out and drink at a bridge called "<st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Witches</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType>Bridge</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This bridge was way out in the middle of the
country.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One night it was my turn to be
the designated driver and so I sat sipping my soda and watching my suitemates
stumble around.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It wasn't long before I
needed to relieve myself, so a friend and I went a short way into the
woods.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Suddenly, a huge crashing noise
tore through the timber.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It sounded like
a very large, angry thing that WANTED us to know it was there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was thrashing and crashing and we screamed
and ran back to the fire, raising the alarm.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Everyone stopped to listen, but the noises had stopped.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We went back next day to look for broken
branches but there weren't any.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The legend
of the bridge includes the unceremonious hanging of a couple of witches many
years ago.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">These are just a few of the encounters I experienced.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I'm sure there are many more other students
there have experienced.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any former
Cottey students please feel free to email me!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">My Dad's Spirit</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: Sharon2519@aol.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;</span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I have always believed in the paranormal and spirits and
have had a few encounters with ghosts in the past. I have recently had an
experience that I truly believe has saved my life.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My father died in 1983. Since his death I have had two vivid
dreams with him which I have to classify as "visitations". In both of
these dreams, he never spoke but I was directed to watch what he was showing
me. On both occasions, the scenes he showed me came to pass and their meaning
was understood. There were nine children in my family and only one of my other
siblings, my sister Barbara, now deceased, would dream about my dad and he
would show her events to come. My Dad and I had a special bond because we both
drove only cars made by Ford.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">In June of 2005 I relocated to another state. At the time I
was in a very abusive and negative relationship. I received no assistance from
the legal system in the prior state that I lived in and this person was allowed
to remain in my home. I really had a battered woman's syndrome, because even
though I wanted out of the relationship I was afraid for myself and my children
of this person seeking revenge.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I had placed my prior home on the market for sale. I kept
the particulars concerning the sale price to myself, but this person knew it
was in a hot area in NYC and I was going to get well over seven figures for it.
He also was very interested in my other assets but I gave him false information
concerning them. Other people in the area had been able to sell their house
within a few weeks of putting them on the market, but I had received no offers
and the house was in great shape.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I completed my move late on a Friday night. I parked my car
in front of my new home and this individual and my two children were in the
house. It began to rain, thunder and lightening. As I went to enter the house
the lights in the car began to flicker on and off.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I checked the doors, restarted the car,
re-locked the car but nothing would stop the flickering of the lights. This had
happened on one other occasion and just as it had started it had just
mysteriously stopped.This continued for about 5 minutes and then stopped.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Approximately a week later, I discovered that the individual
that I was living with was seeing another woman. I was very happy about it
hoping that he would move in with her. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">however, he became more abusive and violent. The police were
summoned to my home four times in two days. Unlike New York, I was able to get
this person evicted from my home with a protection order in effect until a
court date that was scheduled a week later within 24 hours. He believed that he
would have another 30 days in my home. During one of his tirades he made
physical threats against me as well as another person that I discovered was his
girlfriend's husband.His girlfriend's husband was found dead<span style="">&nbsp; </span>five days later and it is under police
investigation.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I went to court and obtained a permanent eviction with a
full force protection order which allows me to protect myself legally in any
way. On this same day I received three offers for my home and I am now going to
contract. The night prior to writing this I thought of my Dad. I said
"Daddy, if you were warning me and protecting me and the kids, Thank
You". As I looked at my Ford Windstar, the lights flickered on and off.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Another thing I found out later was that this woman's
husband had also felt fear for his safety. He notified several of his relatives
and now his wife cannot touch any of his assets or insurance until after the
police investigation and who knows where that might lead.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">A Few of my own Encounters</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: love4damuzik@yahoo.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Okay, to begin, I have been living in the same house my
whole life. Located in <st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Harford</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType>County</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>
<st1:State><st1:place>Maryland</st1:place></st1:State>. My first encounter was
when I was about seven years old I saw a figure hooded and completely draped in
black, drifting around the room which at the time was my sister's later to
become my room. My second encounter was with a friend. I was nine years old,
and upon her saying that my house truly wasn't haunted, I locked her in a room
that had no windows whatsoever. The light was off, and she was at the exact
opposite of the room when I left. I was keeping an eye out underneath the door
to see if she got freaked out and turned the lights on. I heard her scream and
the lights flicked on. Grinning victoriously I had opened the door to find her
sitting in the corner (still at the back of the room) shaking, with every light
in the room on. There was no way possible she could have done it herself, and
to this day, she won't tell me what occurred when she was in there. The next
two encounters that come next in my mind happened in the same night. One being
that it sounded as if a little girl were crying. By this time, my sister had
moved out and I was eleven. The only people in my house were my mom, dad, and
me. And the crying was coming from the exact opposite of the house. Terrified I
went into my room, and eased myself to sleep. I woke up at about three in the
morning, dying of thirst. I got up and went to the kitchen (where the crying
had sounded like it was coming from earlier) I was walking and then saw
something truly horrifying. Sitting there in the kitchen where the light from
the front porch shone down from the window, was a...Honestly I have no idea
what to call it. It was rocking back and forth wringing it's hands. Mumbling
something. I tried to scream but could not. Suddenly I blacked out, and
remmeber nothing else. There are more memories I had, I just dont have the
strength t type anymore.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">My Aunt was sleeping on the sofa on the ground level. The
sofa was leaned against the wall where the stairs were.I was only a baby then.
My Mom and Dad were sleeping in their bedrrom on the right side of a hall
upstairs,my room was on the left. My Aunt heard someone dart down the stairs
and saw a flash of a figure,at first she thought it was my mom trying to scare
her,because afterall,it was halloween. so my Aunt jumped up to grab the person
who ran down the stairs,when she jumped up,no one was there,she heard no one
run back up either. when my Mom and Dad went don into the basement to see what
was down there, they found thousands of dollars worth of old records and
pictures and childrens toys and coins, My Father was a paranormal investigator
at the time and i'm wanting to go back to that house since paranormal
investigating is in my blood.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">By: HPortillo@pier1.com </p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">In reference to the "Brown Lady" who haunts the
Collumns Building at Chowan College in Murfreesboro, NC:</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I am a 2004 alumn from <st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Chowan</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType>College</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I worked in the Columns building for one year
as a student telemarketer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We worked
after the building had been locked for the night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was strange how I would go in to work and
find the hall covered in dried leaves that had fallen from the bushes
surrounding the building.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The leaves
were so abundant that it seemed someone must have intentionally kicked them
into the building.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I asked around and
everyone wondered but had no explanation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The story is that the "Brown Lady" is actually a
former student from when the college was all female.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She is reported to have the name because she
is wearing a brown dress.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Some say she
threw herself off of the roof of the building after an argument with a
boyfriend. Others say that she died of an unknown illness and haunts that
building because at the time of attendance her dorm room was in that
building.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At night when you walk past
the building you can see just one of the 8+ rocking chairs swaying in the
wind.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The building seems earily dark and
antiquated. In three years there, I passed the building almost nightly walking
back from work and I had a hard time allowing myself to look at the windows,
but always forced myself to look just to be sure I wasn't being watched!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Haunted House</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: ntheeuwes@careeralliance.org</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Shook, MO &#8211; Before the road was changed in approximately
2001, there used to be a house that was almost exactly between <st1:City><st1:place>Greenville</st1:place></st1:City>
and Wappapello on <st1:Street><st1:address>D Hwy</st1:address></st1:Street>,
just across from the gravel road to Lost Creek. This was one of only a handful
of houses anywhere close to the two-lane, black-top road, for about 22
miles.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During the 1970&#8217;s there was a
small store on the property call the Terminal Grocery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was said that this home was built by a
George Shook, sometime during the late 1800&#8217;s.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Mr. Shook was the local lumber baron and this house was one of few in
the area built with basically clapboard type siding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The interior walls were double tongue and
groove hardwood.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">There are several stories about this house and property &#8211; I
will only relate the one&#8217;s that I am personally familiar with.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The last family to live there (approximately
from 1966-67 &#8211; 1987 and still owned the property until approximately 1997),
reported several paranormal events.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
was said that the house was haunted by a male ghost whom the family referred to
as &#8220;George&#8221;, who would open the door to the upstairs (used mostly for storage),
open cabinets in the kitchen, open and close other doors in the house and a
rocker in the living room would rock by itself.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This &#8220;presence&#8221; always seemed to be around and protecting the family &#8211;
never doing anything to hurt or harm anyone.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">One night the daughter in the family had some friends spend
the night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They decided to sleep in the
upstairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The upstairs was basically
divided into 2 rooms with a bedroom being the furthest away from the
stairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because this area was used for
storage, this could be almost considered an attic space. There was clutter all
over the place in the larger room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
girls just had a &#8220;path&#8221; to get through to the bedroom that was lined with
books, boxes and more importantly to the story glass canning jars.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The girls settled down to sleep with the
oldest closest to the wall (having to crawl over the other 3 to get out of bed)
&#8211; when this girl woke up, she was at the bottom of the staircase.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Could it have been sleep walking? Maybe? But
how then did she get over the 3 other girls without waking them up and through
the &#8220;minefield&#8221; of clutter without making noise?</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">In 1983, the daughter of the family was spending one of the
few nights she ever spent alone in the house.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Her mother had passed away about six-months before.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The front part of the house was set up with
the living room with a bedroom on each side.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Her bedroom was on the north side of the house. One night, she woke up
to the sound of her mother&#8217;s voice &#8211; just as if she would have been calling her
to get up for school.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was so natural
that it took about the 3rd call of her name before she sat up in bed realizing
that her mother wasn&#8217;t there. That first second she was frightened, and then
felt an extreme sense of calm &#8211; it was as if her mom was letting her know she
was looking out for her and would wake her up if anything were to happen in the
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the girl was about 6 years
old she had an electric blanket catch fire with her, and was extremely afraid
of fire and storms.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I am the daughter of the family &#8211; these incidents happened
to me or with me there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My mother
claimed to be a witch with powers to get rid of warts, and some psychic
powers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That coupled with her being born
on October 31st &#8211; just added more credence to that fact.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There are many people in that area who knew
my mother well and was aware of George and the powers my mom had. I would be
happy to furnish any additional information or provide name of other
individuals who were aware of these incidents &#8211; including the sister of the
girls who woke up at the bottom on the stairs.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My mother was fascinated with the house from the time she first saw it
and when it came up for same a few years later she bought it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was in my family from approximately 1966
to 1997 and I lived there until December of 1984. Another interesting tidbit is
that before purchasing this house, my parents had lived in the <st1:City><st1:place>St.
  Louis</st1:place></st1:City> area.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
looking for a house to purchase there, my mother came real close to purchasing
one of the most noted haunted houses in the USA, without knowing it &#8211; she went
as far as to actually view the house, but decided it needed extensive work and
was really too big &#8211; she just didn&#8217;t like the feeling of the house since my dad
worked nights and it would be mainly her and my brother alone there at night
(this was before I was born in 1962) &#8211; the Lemp mansion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Coincidence or physic phenomenon &#8211; you decide.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Haunted Bookstore?</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: poetrypisces@hotmail.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I used to work in a haunted bookstore a few years ago in <st1:State><st1:place>West
  Virginia</st1:place></st1:State>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I&#8217;ve since moved to <st1:State><st1:place>California</st1:place></st1:State>,
so I don&#8217;t know if any more activity has occurred there or not.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anyways, I&#8217;m going to try to give as much
detail of this as I can.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The bookstore
is in a building that was once the Carnegie library.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The building itself was built in 1904 and is
on the Historic Registry so it can not be torn down or altered drastically in
any way.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It houses more than 500,000
used/rare/out of print books making it known as the biggest used bookstore in
the state.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I won&#8217;t go into saying what
it&#8217;s called, as I&#8217;m sure with a little research anyone can figure it out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When you walk in there is a wrought-iron
spiral staircase that goes up from the basement to the 3rd floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Each floor level surrounding the staircase is
made of thick smoky glass.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is also
a mezzanine on the opposite side that overlooks the store.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And there are 3 awesome cats that roam the
floors, lay on the couches, and give great company to visitors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It&#8217;s quite an amazing place and tourists come
from all over the world to check it out.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Now, keep in mind that I worked there for over a year
opening and closing by myself on many occasions and only had a few experiences
that I&#8217;m still not sure how to explain.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I will admit it did give me the creeps sometimes closing some
nights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After locking the door and
making sure no one was in the place one night me and a co-worker heard books
dropping to the wood floor up in the mezzanine after we turned off the lights
(all the cats were in the office on the first floor with us).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The next morning when we went to go check out
what book fell, there would be stacks of books in front of some of the
bookcases and in front of the fireplace.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>One time we heard it while we were closing and got so scared we ran out
saying we&#8217;d count the money early the next morning instead.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And on other occasions when we heard the
noises, one or both of us would check it out to see that everything was in</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">order- clean and proper with no books on the floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was no cleaning lady at the time
either, as you&#8217;ll read later why.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So,
one morning I was doing inventory of some of the books on the first floor by
the spiral staircase.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We had just
opened, my boss and I, and there was hardly anyone in the store.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An older gentleman came up to me and asked
me, &#8220;What is that?&#8221; and was pointing to the lower steps of the spiral
staircase.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I went over to look and saw a
freshly made (like it was dipped in oil to the touch) child-size BARE footprint
on each step that upon further inspection went all the way up to the 3rd floor
from the basement!!!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It definitely
wasn&#8217;t there when we opened and I quickly did a search of the 3 levels looking
for a barefoot child.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nothing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I told the inquisitive man that &#8220;I don&#8217;t
know&#8221; he kinda just looked mad that I didn&#8217;t know and walked off.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was extremely puzzling to me so I called
out Dan (not his real name), my boss, to come scope it out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When he saw it, I remember him taking off his
baseball cap and scratching his head before saying, &#8220;I&#8230;dunno&#8221;.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This kinda freaked us both out, but decided
to wait until Mary (not her real name either), the owners daughter and manager
of the store, showed up that day to ask her if she had any ideas about it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dan told me that it must have been the
cleaning lady from the night before, but that still didn&#8217;t explain why she took
her shoes off.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It made us feel better
thinking that it was someone human though.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When Mary came and we told her the story she laughed it off saying we
imagined something since the footprints had faded completely by then.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of the cats started laying on the 3rd
step (she never did that) also.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dan
asked Mary if it could have been the cleaning lady and her response scared us
even more.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She said no, and that the
cleaning lady was off for a while undergoing chemotherapy and that even if she
was to come, she didn&#8217;t have the new keys yet (we had to get new locks b/c of a
fired employee).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After that day we never
talked about it again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There are so many
stories surrounding the place, but I always took them with a grain of
salt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Stories of employees quitting
after a few days being scared so much, but they couldn&#8217;t say why or what they&#8217;d
seen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This psychic lady would ask to
spend the night, but she was always given the &#8216;no&#8217; by our manager.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It always felt like someone was watching me
in the basement where the records and used paperbacks were located, but I never
felt threatened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Maybe it&#8217;s just an old
library guest who checked out a book, but never checked out themselves.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thought I'd share my story about this place
since I've never been able to forget it.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I sent you a story earlier on when I used to work at a
haunted bookstore and I have another story to share as well.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This happened when I was 11 years old and I
was staying at grandma&#8217;s house for the night.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was just the two of us in the house.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I was in the spare bedroom a little down the hall from hers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her entire house is a one story house and outside
of the spare room I was staying in was a room directly across the hall and a
furnace built into the floor a little to the left of the door leading into the
living room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">When you would walk across the furnace, it would make an
unmistakable clanging noise, but there were ways around this if you hopped on
the sides and jumped over into the living room.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I think I was the only one that did that though when I was up sneaking
around at night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, this one night I
was in the room watching tv and I remember standing up by the bed with a corner
eye view of the hallway.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was singing
some song I had heard at church that day when I saw a tall white figure walk
past my room leading into the living room.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When I turned to see it, I just caught the very tail end of it for a
split second and it was a solid white figure.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I kept singing for a few more seconds but got quieter as I was trying to
figure out if I saw what I saw was real.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I did see something&#8230;maybe it was gram going in to turn off the lights
and make sure the front door was locked.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Also, I remember hearing the footsteps matching up on the furnace.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, I went into the living room to
inspect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No one was there and the front
door was locked. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp; </span>I turned off the
lights and walked down the hall to my gram&#8217;s room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was already in bed with her sheets pulled
up reading one of those trashy tabloid magazines she loved so much and had the
television on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was wearing bright
fuchsia colored satin pajamas- a far cry from the white I&#8217;d seen pass by my
door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I asked her if she had just walked
into the living room in a white robe to check the living room and she replied
no and that she&#8217;d been in bed this whole time waiting to watch the <st1:time minute="0" hour="11">11 o&#8217;clock</st1:time> news.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Then she asked if I would lock the front door because she&#8217;d
forgotten that night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Needless to say, I
ran back to the other room and turned off the t.v. and lights and ran back to
hers saying I was sleeping with her that night.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>What makes this even more interesting is that my grandpa died in that
house when I was only 2 years old.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
don&#8217;t remember him, but I&#8217;ve heard stories that he liked to sing all the time
and especially to me when I was on his lap.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Makes sense if it was really him that he showed himself while I was
singing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Maybe that&#8217;s just grandpa&#8217;s way
of showing he looks after my gram and makes sure the doors are locked when she
forgets.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I&#8217;ve never experienced anything
else there and what&#8217;s funny is that that house always felt like the safest
place in the world to me.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I was in <st1:place><st1:City>Augusta</st1:City>, <st1:country-region>Georgia</st1:country-region></st1:place>
not too long when I heard about an intersting haunting from one of my relatives
who lives in the south. In <st1:place><st1:City>Augusta</st1:City>, <st1:country-region>Georgia</st1:country-region></st1:place>
there is this huge factory that was used to make gunpowder for the Confederate
armies during the Civil War, heres a modern photo of part of
it--http://www.gcwht.org/trailssites/images/augusta/pic_1_large.jpg. A little
historical background info before I go into the haunting. The factory (which
during the Civil War the South had only 1 factory for every 6 in the North) was
built by the Confederate War Department in 1862 to supply the South with
gunpowder which was becoming scarce because of the naval blockade. The factory
was a group of seperate buildings and it stretches for miles but not all of it
is still standing. The factory was the single largest and best producer of
gunpowder in both the North and South and because of it's seclusion it
survived<span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:City><st1:place>Sherman</st1:place></st1:City>'s
"March to the Sea" in 1864. As far as I know the Augusta Powder Works
produced rifles and precussion caps as well. Now for the haunting...I visited
the site because I was told of a certain pillar not far away from the factory.
It stands alone, a granite pillar of maybe 10 feet in height that once belonged
to a long gone building of the facility and rumor is the pillar is haunted.
During the Civil War that building the pillar belonged to exploded when several
thousand pounds of powder caught fire killing dozens of workmen. Apparently
this pillar is all thats left. It is rumoured that if you touch it you will
soon die. The pillar itself gave me a strange vibe and yes I did touch it:-)
Work crews have tried to tear it down over the years but have failed to make it
budge even when using a bulldozer! It is fact also that a car crashed into the pillar
during the 50's killing the occupants which gave the pillar more mystique. I
could see how maybe the pillar picked up the energy of all the people killed
there and perhaps the spirits are now somehow attached to the pillar which is
why it cant be removed. I don't know if the factory itself is haunted or if it
is still in operation as I didn't bother to check but that pillar sent chills
through me, as if the enrgy of the war was still within it somehow. If you ever
go to <st1:country-region><st1:place>Georgia</st1:place></st1:country-region>
make sure you see this pillar as it's a creepy place.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Here's my story...It comes from Northeast Morse Hall on the <st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Emporia</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType>State</st1:PlaceType> <st1:PlaceType>University</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>
campus in <st1:place><st1:City>Emporia</st1:City>, <st1:State>KS</st1:State></st1:place>.
The background is that a female basketball player on the ESU team had either
recently gotten cut from the team or she'd tried out and didn't make it.
Anyway, she was so distraught that she hung herself in her dorm room, which
happened to be the room caddycorner to my dorm room. It's rumored you can hear
a basketball being dribbled at times. Well, I thought this was all a bunch of
bull until I was in the dorms practically by myself over Spring Break because I
had to work. There might've been a couple girls in other rooms, but I knew the
girls that occupied the "haunted" room were gone. I was sitting in my
room one night after work trying to unwind and I heard the unmistakable sound
of a basketball being dribbled. When I opened the hallway door, the noise was
definitely coming from their room. As a side note, the girls who lived in that
room said when they moved in, the word "help" was drawn on their
wall, so they scrubbed it clean. Not an hour later, the word had reappeared. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">After reading your stories, I thought I might as well submit
my own. Also, you might want to look into hauntings at "the Hollows"
in <st1:place><st1:City>Ottawa</st1:City>, <st1:State>KS</st1:State></st1:place>.
Supposed to be some pretty creepy stuff happening down there.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">As a former employee (tour guide, circa 2000-2001,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have read many stories about the
"ghost" of this now turist attraction. Personally I can not say
without dout that the house and surrounding areas are haunted. However a
personal story of mine occured in the top floor right above the collection of
victorian glass doors and wall paper room, which was apart of the original barn
of the home that Mrs. Winchester first purchesed. I was explaining about a
shoot in the room when I was struck with an over baring heat and an intence
headache, skipping the rest of my speach for that room I asked the guest to
follow me into the "13th bathroom, on the way we passed an old room on the
left and I begain, amusing myself mustly, to say out loud "please mrs.
Winchester not today" weither it was just a fluke, the headache went away
and was I was back again talking about the home. Another story that happened
during my tenure there was a fellow tour guide (as it was latter told to me)
was "pushed" by an unseen presence down the staircase that leads down
from the "widows balcany" after the day it supposedlly occured I
never saw him again, and wtnessed his mother picking up his last pay check.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I thought maybe I'd pass along my own story, undoudtly one
among many with employes, to you at the shadowlands site.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">And also I lived right of highway 17, (california) the
highway/freeway leading to santa cruz, everyday I had to travel on this
highway, and not once did I see an object/orb/manisfastation.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">My First Apartment</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: johnsonee@dteenergy.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">About 4 years ago, while living in my first apartment, I
swear I had an encounter with a ghost. There were several occasions that my
husband would work the <st1:time minute="0" hour="0">midnight</st1:time> shift,
and I would be home alone with our 2 cats. It seemed like everytime I was
alone, and in bed, I could hear footprints walk past the open bedroom door. It
sounded like barefeet on carpeting. The scary part was - everytime I heard the
footprints, so did my 2 cats who would be sound asleep at the end of the bed;
they would both perk up and look out the bedroom door as if they saw something
or someone. There were also 2 times I was cleaning the bathtub with the water
running, when the shower would come on all by itself and spray me when I got to
the end of the bathtub. Some say it could have been malfunctioning, but the
showers were setup so that you had to pull a lever UP and lock it into place
for the shower to come on. Any malfunction would be defying gravity.....</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">We finally moved out of the apartment, because I felt uneasy
being there alone, and it wasn't until about a year ago that I found out about
a girl that had been murdered in my apartment building. Supposedly, her
boyfriend (a fix-it man for the apartment complex) was asphyxiating her while
they were making love, and she suffocated to death. He was so scared, he hid
her in the closet of an empty apartment and she wasn't found until a few days
later. So, I believe that the "encounters" I had just may have been
the girl who was accidentally killed about 8 years ago (4 years before I moved
in). It's hard to say since I never "saw" anything, and my husband
says he never witnessed any of the things I did.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Things have been Happening</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: suadesmooches@yahoo.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Things have been happening ever since we moved into the
house like doors closing and locking by themselves&#8230;. Before we would hear
someone opening the front door of the house, and would walk up the stairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(We live in an old house built in 1901.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is a four bedroom two story house plus
attic.)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I would think it was one of my
sisters and I would call out their names&#8230; one night I was so sure they were
home that it bothered me that they wouldn&#8217;t answer&#8230; I ran down the stairs and
everything was off and locked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I
went up the stairs again I went to their rooms and nothing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I walked to the hallway I saw that the
lights were on downstairs, and keep in mind I just came from there, so I ran
downstairs and asked them what they were doing and to my surprise there was no
one there&#8230; I got chills from head to toe.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I felt so eerie and all of a sudden if felt cold.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I got scared&#8230; so scared that I thought I was
going to pee on myself&#8230; right then the lights (all of them) started
flickering.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At that same moment my mom
was praying the Rosary upstairs in her room.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That was the first week she started praying.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My sister Susie was dating her now husband at
the time and my little sister was the chaperone.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That was one of many things that happened to
me&#8230; my mom and sisters have their own stories.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After my Mom began praying little by little things stopped.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now there are just little things here and
there that are s rting to bug me.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My mom since that week has not stopped praying the Rosary
every night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She got so good at it that
it takes her 20 to 30 minutes to pray &#8230; at the norm it&#8217;s like a 40 &#8211; 45 minute
prayer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It&#8217;s been a few weeks now that I
see something around me where ever I am in the house&#8230; sometimes in the bathroom
, in the kitchen but not too much in my room.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I started to think that my glasses were just creating shadowy spots so I
stopped wearing them at home&#8230; but then with out my glasses the shadows become
much clearer and I would do double takes to check out what I thought I
saw.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I don&#8217;t feel threatened or too
scared.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I just don&#8217;t feel alone in the
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now I where my glasses cause I
don&#8217;t want to notice the shadows all the time.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I&#8217;m not afraid to walk around the house at night&#8230; like I said I don&#8217;t
feel threatened anymore (like in the first few years living there).</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Before I would walk up the stairs and you could feel and
hear someone walking behind you&#8230; I live in an old house so the floor creaks at
every step you take.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It felt as if they
were right behind your neck&#8230; my Mom and sisters felt that same thing too.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It wasn&#8217;t all the time&#8230; only at night and in
the early hours of the morning.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">A few times it would be like 3 or 3:30am and we would all be
home and the slam of the front door would wake all of us up and we would all
hear someone walking up the stairs and there was no one there.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I&#8217;ve got to say something though&#8230; it officially stopped (not
completely, but the threatening feelings) when our baby kittens were born in
the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My sister Susie brought home
a stay pregnant cat&#8230; two weeks later she had kittens.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We kept two of the kittens and gave the other
two away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well when they were all tiny
they would all his at the same time at the air downstairs in the living room
and they would do it upstairs a lot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
believe that the presence of the cats scared what ever was there away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">My Dog Rebel</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By:Jeffrey.Lewis@dm.af.mil</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">When I was a lot younger (around 5) we had a family dog. He
was a large black German Shepard mix named Rebel. He was very protective of my
brother, sister and I. We lived in the country on the shores of <st1:place>Lake
 Erie</st1:place>. If strangers ever came by the house, he would instinctively
get between them and us, growling.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">In the wintertime, we would follow him through the snow
banks in the woods surrounding the house. He would plow through, making a path
for us. I was the youngest and would fall behind. He would always come back to
get me. In the summer, we would go down and play in the creek by the house. He was
my first best friend.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">When I was ten, we had to have him put to sleep. He was
older and in pain. I cried the whole day. That night, I had a dream about him.
In it, Rebel was there. We were in the backyard. He was hobbling around,
because he was in pain. He started walking towards me in the dream. Suddenly he
was struck by some Jacob&#8217;s ladders (those are the sunbeams that break through
clouds). He started dissolving. It was fairly gruesome, but it made me sad and
happy at the same time. I knew it was more than a dream, and Rebel was telling
me he wasn&#8217;t in pain anymore. After his body was completely gone, I woke up
crying.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I few months later, I was out in the woods. I was still sad
at Rebel not being there. That&#8217;s when I saw him. He was up in the distance. I
ran to catch up to him, and he would run ahead, never letting me catch up, but
stopping if I fell too far behind. He eventually led me down to the river. He
looked back at me. I got the feeling he was telling me he had to go, but he had
wanted to play one last time. He walked into the center of the river, into some
Jacob&#8217;s ladders created by the leaves of tree&#8217;s hanging over the river, and
disappeared.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I know this isn&#8217;t a scary story. I&#8217;m actually tearing up
twenty years later remembering it. It&#8217;s the only ghost experience I&#8217;ve ever had
though.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Here's to prove that not all all ghosts are bad...</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I live in a very small village called <st1:place><st1:City>Lood</st1:City>,
 <st1:State>Michigan</st1:State></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I have since birth and made friends with everyone that's ever lived in
777 <st1:place>W Kood</st1:place> rd. which is directly across the street from
my humble abode.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When i was five i
finally was allowed to walk down to a little general store that was a block
from my house, which was torn down and a house built over the lot, and that's where
i met my friend Kate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After a month or
so i finally headed to her house. After hours of non-sense play of Snot-Man,
har har, we conned our mothers to let us spend the night at her house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That night both of us swore to have heard
some sort of la-la bye being hummed but no one was sing nor was a music box
playing, and from that day till Kate moved we both heard every night well Kate
did i only heard it when i was over.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After a while we just ignored it it was actually liked it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sorta a calming feeling from it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Around 1999 my sisters friend Marie moved
in<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and our parents and hers became good
friends and we once again over there constantly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And after awhile my mom and Marie's mother
started watching on another kids on and off and several times i would have to
sleep over, and just like before e la-la bye returned and this time Marie's mom
and dad swore they heard it them selves.<span style="">&nbsp;

<p class="MsoNormal">The Night The Lights Went Out In <st1:City><st1:place>Cairo</st1:place></st1:City></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;</span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Born and raised in NJ......I have always been a
"sensitive".....I was used to "visits" from spirits that
knew I could "see" them.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But
I never really gave thought much to them being a part of my vacation.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Anyway, I always been fond of ancient history and the
Pyramids.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was one of my dreams when I
was a child was to grow up and go see the place where King Tut had once
lived.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I got older I was fortunate
enough to have the funds to travel so I finally made a plan to visit <st1:country-region><st1:place>Egypt</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I was very excited about the trip and had been telling my ex
about the story of</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">the "Curse" of the Tomb. I had vaguely remembered
a story about the night I believe Howard Carter (he was an archeologist who
discovered the tomb) died all the lights went out in <st1:City><st1:place>Cairo</st1:place></st1:City>
and a dog (his Dog) was heard howling back in <st1:City><st1:place>London</st1:place></st1:City>
as his master died. It is thought that he died of the "Curse".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Supposedly written on the exterior the tomb
were the words. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Death Shall Come on Swift Wings To Him Who Disturbs the
Peace of the King... </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">On my own adventure, my ex husband and I rented camels and
went to visit the tombs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Out in the
desert close to the tombs we rode through an ancient burial grounds. This was
the cemetery they buried the people who built the pyramids we were told. Seems
after this point I felt we were not "alone".<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Even my ex husband who DOES NOT believe at all in these
"spirits" felt this odd feeling of not being alone. That feeling
carried with us the whole day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was to
say the least a bit uneasy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The faint
smell of "dirty and musty" followed us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was busy making jokes and trying to pass
it off with giggles.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">We were staying at the Rameses Hilton in down town <st1:City><st1:place>Cairo</st1:place></st1:City>
right across the bridge from <st1:City><st1:place>Giza</st1:place></st1:City>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hardly a place you would expect to find a
spirit but as it were something or someone "followed us" back to the
hotel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Back at the room we were going to shower before dinner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Walking past the darkened bathroom coming
into the room I could "see" the faint outline of a "man" in
the bathroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Very Odd I thought.....I
told my ex husband but he kind of passed off as too long in the hot sun. The
"smell" of dirty and musty stuck with us though.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was what I would imagine the smell of
someone long dead.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was hard for us
to ignore. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I kept replayed the story of the lights going out in <st1:City><st1:place>Cairo</st1:place></st1:City>
over in my mind again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Wondering what
could have made that happen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My ex
husband of course never heard the story before I told him nor believed in any
of the tale. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">He was kind of kidding me the whole day about yes they are
going to come to a Modern Hotel and "get you" and take you back to
the tomb with them. "The Mummy Returns" and all that stuff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was having a good laugh on me that
day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Trying to ignore the "man" and the smell, thinking
a shower will help.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I turned on the
bathroom light and started running the shower.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I got in the shower and my ex husband got in with me. He was joking the
whole time about the lights are going to go out "watch".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was making howling sounds like the dog
that was supposedly heard howling when the darkness fell over <st1:country-region><st1:place>Egypt</st1:place></st1:country-region>
in the tale of Howard Carter. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">As he was about to reach for the water to make it cooler the
lights in the room went out. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Now I really thought at first how did he "rig"
this up to scared me. But then as I jumped out of the shower to try the light
switches..... I realized it was not just the bathroom in darkness but the whole
hotel room.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I tried every light in the room....</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I kept telling him I can't believe he rigged the whole room
to go into darkness like that but he was not laughing anymore.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is a huge hotel, so I am thinking damn
ok, if he had nothing to do with the room lights going out how had all the
lights in the whole hotel go out?<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">It was still light enough with the drapes open to see in the
room we called the front desk.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>They
said no the lights are on fine in the whole hotel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sure enough my ex husband got dressed and
went into the hallway.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All lights were
on and working all over the hotel.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Meanwhile the front desk sent someone to investigate the
lights situation in our room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
changed all the bulbs in the room....No lights....They went to the breaker
boxes and found our room the ONLY ROOM out of a hotel of over 300 rooms was the
only room effected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">So I guess it might have been a fluke...For me at
least....The Lights Went Out in <st1:City><st1:place>Cairo</st1:place></st1:City>.
Whatever it was, some spirit that heard my thoughts...My fears or the
"man" who followed us back to the room and would show my ex husband
not to play with "father nature".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Fact, fluke or fiction I will never know.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What I do know is it scared the pants off
me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>P.S. My ex never joked with me again
about the "spirits".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>LOL</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">We had the awesome experience of living next door to the
mansion and gave tours . Their are several ghosts in the mansion- you can feel
them touch you.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The front is haunted by
good spirits and the feeling is happy but as soon as you walk to the back
stairs- the slave stairs you will feel the cold in the air and you get goose
bumps. We have seen lights on in the attic- there are no lights in the attic
and seen a young boy standing looking out the window.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the home we rented I believe there were
ghosts also-<span style="">&nbsp; </span>we woke up at <st1:time minute="0" hour="4">4 am</st1:time> to the smell of coffee brewing and there
was none, we would have things disappear where everyone was searching for the
lost item only to have it reappear right in sight!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both homes the lights would go on and off
anytime you asked about the spirits there.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>People would take pictures and have ghosts appear in the pictures...it
truly is a haunted mansion!!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The story is
Major Graham left the mansion to a slave who then killed him and threw him down
the well.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Grahams cemetery is across the
road on a mountain. If you would like any information please e-mail me</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We were
homeless<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and a nice old woman had a
house that had just been siting there abondoned for about 20 years , She<span style="">&nbsp; </span>ended up leting us stay there Yet we found it
odd she only let us stay there paying $70 a month to live in that house. We
stayed there for 10 years till it got far too bad for us to handle, It was me my
mother and my grandmother staying in that house, But we always felt more were
there , Several times we could leave a room noticing how things were but when
we went back things were scattered and moved from where we left it. Also<span style="">&nbsp; </span>there were more violent<span style="">&nbsp; </span>ones there , we noticed that becuase of
scratches appearing on the walls and on me while i slept.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The violence seemed to happen in my grandmothers room<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and the kitchen. the Worst of the violence
happened int he back bedroom( my</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">grandmothers)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>when we
slept,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>my mother could hear me talking
to what seemed several poeple, but when she came to check noone was there , id
Be at the edge of the bed<span style="">&nbsp; </span>like i was
holding someones hands and they were singing ring around the rosey in a
different language , id look like iw as awake<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>then all of asudden my mother and grandmother would see my face change
as if i was scared to death.I was screaming and fighting<span style="">&nbsp; </span>like they were pulling me<span style="">&nbsp; </span>to them , That was from how they saw me now
ill say what i did see from the instances .. unfortunatly its pretty much
burned into my memory ,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>id remember
going to sleep then feeling someone tap me on the shoulder<span style="">&nbsp; </span>but all i could see were</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">5 figures in white robes<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>they looked like kids , They would ask if i wanted to go play so id ask my
mom if it was ok to go or not, Shortly atfterwords we'd begin playing but it
seemed like everything around us vanished<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>and it looked like we were around a patch of flowers.. After running
around it and chanting like they did they would stop and say "</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">we want to show you something" when they did they'd
reach under their chins and<span style="">&nbsp; </span>pull up .
thats when i noticed the robes went from white to black. the kids had no face's
no skin<span style="">&nbsp; </span>they were skulls. The area
around the<span style="">&nbsp; </span>flowers were gone and seemed
like ntohing but fires, thats when they would start trying to grab at me .. my
mom and grandmother would see me grabing at the steel posts of my grandmothers
bed and me being pulled from it .<span style="">&nbsp; </span>my mom
and grandmother even tried getting phycologists to see if it was just me or the
house. so far they say it wasnt me.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>we've had priests go to the house when we lived there<span style="">&nbsp; </span>to bless the house. most of the priests who
went<span style="">&nbsp; </span>never stayed for more then 4
minutes, the only priest that lasted the longest threw the holy water to my mom
and said he had to go . Something seriusly isnt right in that house but what
made us move the fastest<span style="">&nbsp; </span>was when my
cusins came to visit from <st1:State><st1:place>florida</st1:place></st1:State>,
Me, and my two cusins<span style="">&nbsp; </span>were sleeping in
the living room when we kept hearing something call our names. we all seemed to
have woken up from it and looked twords the voice when we</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">saw a blackish cloud at the cieling<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>saying for us to go to the attic</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">and help .. me and my cusins went in different directions to
wake everyone up<span style="">&nbsp; </span>thats when i noticed my
grandmother was talking to my mom becuase she saw a woman wearing<span style="">&nbsp; </span>a long white gown standing in her room<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and told her she was just checking on her so
she thought it was my mom and went to see what she meant My mom was asleep and
knew nothing abotu it. Needless to say we moved out the next day ... Far too
much happened at once in that house , The original owner<span style="">&nbsp; </span>died a few years back.I disided to send this
to yall so yall would know that more then 2 places here in eunice are indeed
haunted . Also<span style="">&nbsp; </span>in regards to the Basil
school.. i use to go there and its said the school burned down 60 years ago .
Whats bad is ive been there when they put new doors in<span style="">&nbsp; </span>you could<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>turn away for even a moment and the Same designs of a face that were on
the old doors will be on the new ones.. some students there use to tell me
about seeing poeple<span style="">&nbsp; </span>in the gym that
looked like thier skin was gone. but im sure yall have heard all the stories of
the place. Thank You for reading this.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Hi, my name is alex and tonight me and three of my good
friends went to the three gates. We have been there befor e but never seen
anything like tonight. One of the first things we noticed was that there was
more animals up there then usually. We really were not sure what they were and
were not up there to look at animals so we kept going. First thing we did was
shut our lights off and drove up to the first gate. Like every other time we
have been up there, we were all debating on whether we should do it or not.
Well first off this is the urban legend we know, first thing is to shut off the
head lights to a car, then you have to drive down to the first gate, and
everyone has to get out of the car and knock on it 3 times, this goes for the
second and third gate. Once you get to the third gate, you have to drive back
to the first gate turn around and drive out . Thats when awkward stuff is
suppose to happen. For us and we have been here many times,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>we all noticed one thing, one street light
was flickering or would be on for like 30 seconds then go off. Which was sort
of fun and scary at the same time. But when we went to go knock on the second
gate three times, the light went out jus as we got there and there was not any
flickering but jus pitch black for like two minutes. Thats never happened to us
before</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">One night I was getting ready for bed in my mom's room,(my
bed wasn't put together yet,so I slept in my mom's room.).I was looking for a
radio station,and I heard someone walking twords the room.When I looked
up,there was the shape of a railroad conducter,all black!It turned what used to
be it's face.I could see two holes where it's eyes were.Then it turened away
and walked into the livingroom.After it walked away,I screamed,and ran into the
living room.After we moved out of that house,my momchecked into the history of
the house.The house was a ticket office for a railroad that used to run by the
house.Now, a paved road runs in front of the house,and the railroad is a dirt
road.Now my family believes mebecause our bus stop(our parents wanted to keep
us in the same school when we moved from the house)is next to the dirt road
that was the railroad.One day in March,me, my mom, and my three brothers were
sitting in the car at the bus stop, and we heard a train as if it were right
next to us.And the closest railroad was four towns away.The incedent at the
house happend when I was eight,and when my family and I were at the bus stop
happendat the age eleven.My friends say I'm making it up.Mabey the people who
read this will believe me!!!!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">When my father died in 1998, I thought I'd never see him
again. Wrong. Three months later during the Christmas season, I was playing
with some of the ornaments on our tree when I looked up straight into the
hallway and saw him walking towards the front door clutching an ACE Hardware
bag. Another time I was taking medication (I have asthma) with my back turned
to the rest of the kitchen when I heard loud footsteps that sounded like boots
walking across our kitched floor. I was too scared to turn around, even though I
knew who it was. He's got other ways of letting us know he's still here, too. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My sister died in our house back in 1993 at the age of 13.
My mom claims to hear her laughter and calls of "Mommy" sometimes.
(My sister had severe cerebral palsy and this is one of the few word she said).
I saw my sister on two occasions. One time I saw her in the hallway briefly, as
if she had just come to see me. ( I was seven when she died, but that night I
promised her I would turn 14 since she wouldn't) Another time my family had
just left on a shopping trip and shortly after I looked out the window and saw
her running around on our driveway. I was around 14 when I started to see her,
and came to the conclusion she had come back to see me.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">A lady and a little boy came around in 2001. The lady was
dressed as if she had been out hiking. She came through our front door and to
my room. When I got up to check, I found my room empty. Later my mom knocked n
my door and asked if I had been trying to come into her room. I said "No. Why?"
She told me that someone had just slammed her door. I also heard a female voice
that did t belong to anyone I knew calling my name as if trying to tell me
something. The little boy is dressed in early 1900's clothes and the one time I
saw him I was about to go to bed when I looked up and saw him sitting in a
chair next to our dishwasher. He was looking right at me and smiling as if to
say "I know who you are, but you don't know me."</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">There is also a baby that cries every year around the
Thanksgiving holidays, but to my knowledge no baby has ever died in my house. I
sometimes think a lot of this has to do with the fact that there is a cemetery
down the road from my house. My mom also told me this house has been moved
before. Who knows?</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Back about a year or two ago I went to a house on Sleepy
Hollow Road in Hunt with my sister, her friend, and my aunt with her three year
old son.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rumor has it that the house was
built by a man in the late 1800's for his mistress whom he got prenant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He couldn't let his wife know what had
happened even though he loved this other woman so he set her up there to have
the child with promises that he would visit her all the time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Months after she had the baby she had feelings
of resentment for the child who she felt kept her from her love simply because
it was out of wedlock.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the woman smothered the baby and burried it
in the back yard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She then killed
herself by jumping off the balcony.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
the man came to see her he found her dead and the fresh mound of dirt in the
back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was so struck with grief that
he shot himself in the up stairs bedroom where they had slept.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While we were there we looked in windows
knowing it was completely unoccupied.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>You could see shadows moving in the back rooms and sudden gusts of wind
moving the curtains but no windows open.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There was a see-saw in the back yard that moved every now and then from
one side to the other and old pick nick tables that stacked ontop of eachother
on their own after we had left the area for a good thirty- forty five
minutes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As we were driving off a light
in the upstairs bed room came on and a dark shadow appeared of a man plain as
day and a light outside appeared.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Down
the road a ways my little cousin told his mother he didn't want to go back
because there was a monster in that house and he was bad.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My sister did the research to learn exactly
what happened by going to the library, the court house, by contacting previous
owners of the house who by the way could not, like all the others, stay for
more than three months.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">On one of the foggiest nights we had when my daughter and I
got home from Christmas shopping.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
friend stopped by for a few minutes as we sat in the living room chatting. No
one else was home. The only light on was the lamp in the living room where we
were. All of a sudden the television in my bedroom came on, the volume was full
blast we jumped up and looked at each other thinking someone was in the house
with us. I went into my bedroom and turned it off. I had a uneasy feeling
entering into my bedroom. My friend was very uneasy, I told her that it has a
short and does that often, just so she wouldn't leave. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">After about 45 minutes my daughter and friend went home. I
become very scared. I brought in my dog (Nemo).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I got out my knitting and turned the television on in the living room,
trying not to think about what had happened earlier. All of a sudden Nemo
started jumping straight up in mid air, jumping on furniture, wagging his tail
and following something near the ceiling. I got his attention and made him sit.
He was next to me on the sofa watching television and watching above the
television he got down and walked in front to the television tilting his head
from right to left, slowly moving it back above the television and over the
window. I had enough of this and put him back outside. When I came back into
the house the television in the living room was off and the one back in my
bedroom was on. By now I was really scared I wanted to leave, but the fog was
only getting thicker. I turned the television back on, and turned off the
other, again. I turned on the old movie channel waiting for my husband to get
home from work. My back was toward the kitchen when I heard footsteps, and the
sound of water. I turned to look and what I saw was a large orb right behind
me, all of a sudden I felt a peace come over me, I wasn't scared any longer. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Before my Mother passed away, a month earlier we were
watching Ghost Stories together, and she asked me if I believed in Ghost. I
told her yes. I asked her if she passed away if she would come back and visit
me, and with the most sincere voice she replied " of course I will".</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I have read many ghost stories most in disbelief, however
the one i have to tell is true i swear on my grandmothers grave. One cloudy
tuesday evening on a cold september day, me and my friend had to stay back
after school to help clear up after a parent-teacher conference. The nights had
just started geting darker and the fog had set in across the field, as we
stared out of the window from our top floor class room. Our school was about
75years old built next to a cemetry. I asked my friend to go get me some cloths
to wipe down the tables form the closet down stairs, she left the room and
hurried down the stairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By now everyone
exept Mr Graves our maths tutor had gone home, he was in his office across the
hall from the room i was in. I was stood alone for what seemed like forever,
when i started to hear tapping coming from the window. At first i thought
nothing of it... until it became louder and continued to get faster. I turned
quickly to the window to see an old woman with long white hair and blood
streaming from her head, her hair was stained red with blood her eyes were wide
and bloodshot. I had never witnessed such a sight i froze with fear and
couldn't take my eyes off her. Her hand rose to the window and she cried out in
pain, then as quickly as she appeard she vanished. I told many people of my
story, and i soon found out that an ex-teacher committed suicide 50 years ago
that day, from jumping out the window which i had seen her appear!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Haunting on Staten Island</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I live on Staten Island in a very old house. We have seen
several ghosts over the past three years. An old man in a bowler hat is often
seen walking around the first floor. The house was a speak-easy in the 1920's
and things are always crashing in the basement where this all happened. On the
second floor a little girl is seen standing by the closet watching people while
they sleep. She is dressed in a long black dress and wears a bonnet. She never
moves and is never seen anywhere else in the house.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Crashing coming from the kitchen happens a lot, too.
Cabinets, closets and draws open and close on their own. Two disembodied voices
can be heard late at night coming from the kitchen having a friendly
conversation. Then there is the backyard where you can often see lights flash
across and recently things have been tossed around that the wind couldn't have
picked up. Last night I even heard a little girl screaming in the backyard, at
the same pitch and volume for an hour as though it was a record that was
skipping. I asked the people who use to live here if they ever heard or saw
anything and they described the same apparitions and strange occurences as we
are experiencing. They are becoming more frequent the longer we live in the
house.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Fr. Malachi Martin, was for years, the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Vatican</st1:place></st1:country-region>'s
front line exorcist.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Most instances, he
said, "were not hauntings of buildings, but of people."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He wrote a book, among his many, called
"Hostage to the Devil" the Possession and Exorcism of Five
Contemporary Americans."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is one
of the few Jesuit priests to have been given access to ALL <st1:place>Vatican</st1:place>
archives, this permission given by Pope John Paul.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He states that demonic possession has never
changed, but we have changed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our
society has created a favorable climate for the occurence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He consistently warns throughout the book to
not to try to conjure these demons, as they are very dangerous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Possession is real, and there are real prices
to be paid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also states that since
1976, demonic Possession has become real entertainment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately, we have created a cultural
desolation very conducive to these spirits.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He also states that due to this condition, young people are far more
likely, and are generally defenseless.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He states this is NOT magic, or paranormal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is real.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To compare spirit with the elements of our lives and material world,
which it can and sometimes does manipulate for it's own ends, is a fatal
mistake, but one that is very often made.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Eerie sounds can be produced by spirit - but spirit is not eerie
sound.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Objects can be made to fly across
the room, but telekenesis is no more spirit than the material object that was
made to move.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He says "one man,
whose story is told in this book, made the mistake of thinking otherwise, and
he nearly paid with his life when he had to confront the error he had
made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This stuff is nothing to fool
around with.</p>
