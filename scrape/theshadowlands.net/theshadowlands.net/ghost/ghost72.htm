<P><B> </B>
<P><B>I have had a wonderful experience with the </B>
<P><B>spirit of my beloved dog. Danny is a Cocker Spaniel. I had wanted a
Cocker all </B>
<P><B>of my life. I finally got the opportunity when I received a settlement
from an </B>
<P><B>insurance co. My husband told me that he wanted me to get something
that I had </B>
<P><B>always wanted. Needless to say the Cocker was my first response. That
very day </B>
<P><B>we found a news paper and looked for puppies. We found one listing
close by and </B>
<P><B>went there to look. HE was sitting there in the corner looking at me
with the </B>
<P><B>most beautiful eyes I had ever seen.After that, Danny was my constant

companion. We </B>
<P><B>went everywhere together and except for work, he was always by my side.
We took </B>
<P><B>him on all our camping trips and sightseeing excursions. He was a great

traveler </B>
<P><B>and loved being on the road. The minute I thought about leaving for
a trip, </B>
<P><B>Danny would prance around me just waiting to hear the jingle of his
dog collar. </B>
<P><B>It got to the point that I had to put his collar on just to calm him
down so I </B>
<P><B>could get everything ready. Danny was more then a friend, he understood
my moods </B>
<P><B>and always knew the right thing to do to cheer me up or settle me down.
He </B>
<P><B>rejoiced in my happiness When I became disabled Danny made sure that
when we </B>
<P><B>went out, I could keep up with him. The years went much to fast. Before
I knew </B>
<P><B>it he was 13 years old and slowing down. Now it was my turn to slow
down for </B>
<P><B>him. When the end came it was so sudden I felt out of step with reality
for a </B>
<P><B>while. He had been ill and suddenly one evening he started having breathing

</B>
<P><B>difficulties. I put him in the truck with me and I took off for the
Vet's </B>
<P><B>office. He was unconscious by the time I got there and died about 15

minutes </B>
<P><B>later. I was devastated. I was so overcome </B>
<P><B>with grief that all I wanted to do was die with him. I still can't
talk about </B>
<P><B>him with great ease but it is much better now. One night about a week
after he </B>
<P><B>passed over, I had a dream about him. He came running into my arms
</B>
<P><B>and I felt his overwhelming love for me. I held him and cried into
the soft fur </B>
<P><B>on his back. He looked just as he did as a young dog. He had been blind
in one </B>
<P><B>eye, but now his eye was fine and he was so happy! He stayed with me
until I </B>
<P><B>stopped crying and then turned and ran off. He was really there with
me. Our </B>
<P><B>spirits met and he was able to comfort me enough to be able to cope
with his </B>
<P><B>loss. I think my part in this was actually an out of body experience,

because it </B>
<P><B>was to real for a regular dream or a lucid dream, which I have had
on several </B>
<P><B>occasions. Another outcome of this meeting was the overwhelming desire
to get </B>
<P><B>another Cocker. I wasn't going to get another because I was afraid
I would </B>
<P><B>always be comparing him with Danny. But I suddenly HAD to find another
one. Even </B>
<P><B>that search was a little unusual. We live in Oregon and have access
to the two </B>
<P><B>largest cities, Portland and Salem. I looked in 6 news papers and found

only one </B>
<P><B>listing for Cocker pups! There are usually dozens of them. I called
the lady </B>
<P><B>that had them and was at her door step and hour later. DJ came home
with </B>
<P><B>me. He is a great little guy and I love him dearly. He has secured
his own spot </B>
<P><B>in my heart. It's great to have him home </B>
<P><B>again. I realize that this isn't your typical ghost </B>
<P><B>story, but it does show that our pet companions are with us always.
If you don't </B>
<P><B>include this story I don't mind. It's be cathartic just writing </B>
<P><B>it!</B>

<H3><A NAME=house><B> The House On Central Ave</B></A>
</H3><P><B>By: morninglily@webtv.net </B>
<P>
<P><B>This story has been told to me by Mother and Grandmother over the

years.</B>
<P><B>Today they still have nightmares about what occured at this house

they</B>
<P><B>lived in.  Here is their story as it was told to me....</B>
<P>
<P><B>When my mother was 7 years old in (1957), my grandparents rented a

house</B>
<P><B>from a young man who said he was renting it out on behalf of his

Father</B>
<P><B>who  recently moved to  Alabama.  He had only request: He wanted to

keep</B>
<P><B>some belongings in the basement and he locked the door with a

padlock.</B>
<P><B>He told them never to try to get in the basement.  My Grandfather</B>
<P><B>thought this was reasonable enough and he agreed.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>Soon after, strange things began to happen in the house.  But, they

only</B>
<P><B>happened when my Grandfather was not present.  He worked graveyard
at</B>
<P><B>the time so My Grandma and Mother were left alone at night.  My

Mother</B>
<P><B>was the first to see the ghost.  She awoke one night to see a shadow

of</B>
<P><B>something standing next to her bed.  As she looked up she seen that

it</B>
<P><B>was headless.  There was nothing above its shoulders!  She screamed

and</B>
<P><B>went to her Mothers room.  Grandmother could not calm her that night,</B>
<P><B>but she did believe her because she had felt it too.  </B>
<P>
<P><B> Mom slept in her Mothers room after that.  One night, it jerked

their</B>
<P><B>covers off.  Grandmother immediately got up an looked around the room</B>
<P><B>for a reasonable expanation, when suddenly she turned and seen it for</B>
<P><B>herself.  She nearly fainted.  After that, she and my Mother went to

bed</B>
<P><B>everynight with the door locked and moved the dresser in front of the</B>
<P><B>door thinking they could prevent its entrance.  Needless to say that

did</B>
<P><B>not work.  Over time, the ghost grew stronger as did it's attacks.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Window started opening in the dead of winter, they heard footsteps</B>
<P><B>walking from the bedroom to the basement door and going down.  The

chair</B>
<P><B>in the living room would rock all of the time.  Doors would slam, and

at</B>
<P><B>night it would take their covers.  At times you could hear it

breathing</B>
<P><B>heavily.   My grandmother could not take it anymore, she tried so

hard</B>
<P><B>to convince my grandfather, but nothing worked.  He simply did not</B>
<P><B>believe in such things.</B>
<P>
<P><B>How it all came to an end:   There was a large rust colored stain in

the</B>
<P><B>bedroom, that my grandmother could never remove.  There were also

stains</B>
<P><B>in the hall leading to the basement door.  After a period of time,

she</B>
<P><B>became convinced it was blood.  This is how she came to that</B>
<P><B>asumption....</B>
<P><B>  The young man returned on day from Alabama to collect his things.

 She</B>
<P><B>asked him about the stains that she could not remove.  He told her

that</B>
<P><B>while his wife was in, she miscarried in the basement and managed to</B>
<P><B>drag herself to the bedroom where she collapsed.  She lived, but they</B>
<P><B>were never able to get all of the blood up.  Well, my Grandmother</B>
<P><B>halfway bought his story.  Later that night, they invited him to

stay,</B>
<P><B>before heading back to Alabama.  He did stay, but refused to sleep
in</B>
<P><B>the house. Mind you, it was winter time.  The next day after he left,</B>
<P><B>Grandma asked the neighbors a few questions.  Why did the boys Father</B>
<P><B>never come around and why did he give up his home?  The neighbors</B>
<P><B>reported that the Father and son fought constantly.  The old man was

a</B>
<P><B>brutal drunk.  One night they thought they heard a gunshot, but

wasn't</B>
<P><B>sure.  Shortly after that, they noticed the old man wasn't around.

 When</B>
<P><B>they questioned the boy, he said that his dad left for Alabama and

that</B>
<P><B>he was moving there too.  A few days later, they noticed the boy had

his</B>
<P><B>basement dug out.  He said he was cementing it .   Well, that was

enough</B>
<P><B>for my grandmother.  After hearing all of this, she went to the house</B>
<P><B>and decided to bust the lock off of the door.  When she got down in

the</B>
<P><B>basement she noticed in the corner, there was a real bad sinkhole in

the</B>
<P><B>cement.  It was the perfect shape of a grave.  Next, all of the

lights</B>
<P><B>went out on her and she heard footsteps.  She freaked out.  That

night</B>
<P><B>she told Grandpa the whole story.  He still didn't buy it, but that</B>
<P><B>night, he came face to face with it.  He almost had a heart attack.

 He</B>
<P><B>immediately made plans for them to move.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>The night before they left, all of the windows in the house would not</B>
<P><B>stay shut.  Doors kept opening and slamming.  Grandpa got up no less</B>
<P><B>than four times to shut the windows.  Finally, after an unseen hand</B>
<P><B>grabbed my Mothers foot and tried to drag her in the floor did

Grandpa</B>
<P><B>have enough.  They slept the rest of the night in their car even

though</B>
<P><B>they had 3 inches of snow on the ground.  To this day, my Mother will</B>
<P><B>not go near that house.  Later a preacher and his family moved in it.</B>
<P><B>Their daughter later was admitted to a mental hosptial.  It was

because</B>
<P><B>she was being attacked by an unseen force in the house and her

parents</B>
<P><B>thought she was just crazy, that was at least until my grandmother

told</B>
<P><B>them her story of the house.....  </B>

<H3><A NAME=at><B>Hauntings at Midnight</B></A>
</H3><P><B>By: CoriMea@aol.com</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B>The house I grew up in when I was younger, I always thought was haunted.

At</B>
<P><B>midnight every night I would wake up and see a man standing in the
doorway of</B>
<P><B>my bedroom. This started when I was about 5.  I am 17 now.  for 12
years this</B>
<P><B>has been happening.  The apparitions stopped for a while when My

grandfather</B>
<P><B>died, I was 10.  They soon started again.  The man would be wearing
an old</B>
<P><B>suit and a hat. I could never see his face, I would sometimes hear

breathing</B>
<P><B>and I could tell that he was watching me.  I moved out of my

Grandfathers</B>
<P><B>house at age 12 and they stopped. But when I would come back to visit

my</B>
<P><B>brother and grandmother who still lived in the house, the apparition

would</B>
<P><B>come back.  I am no longer afraid of the man.  I know that the man
would never</B>
<P><B>hurt, because if that was his intention then he would have done it
a long time</B>
<P><B>ago.  I think that the man is my guardian, not my angel. I think that
he is my</B>
<P><B>watcher, the one who watches over me and keeps me safe. </B>
<P><B>thank you for allowing me to share my true-storie</B>

<H3><A NAME=st><B>St. Peter, MN</B></A>
</H3><P><B>By: angie.henrikson@vtechco.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>Two years ago I lived in a small house in St. Peter Mn. where I went

to</B>
<P><B>college.  The house was over a hundred years old and had been rumored
to be</B>
<P><B>haunted.  The attic which was rarely used had a trap door and the girls

who</B>
<P><B>lived on the floor below the attic often heard noises that sounded

like</B>
<P><B>people walking around.  One night I was lying in bed and I heard a

knocking</B>
<P><B>sound in my room.  It was late and I had been up studying and I knew

that</B>
<P><B>everyone else had been asleep for hours.  I immediately became terrified

and</B>
<P><B>knew it was a ghost.  I looked across the room and standing next to

my</B>
<P><B>closet, where the noise was coming from, I saw a medium sized person</B>
<P><B>standing there.  It was fairly dark in the room but the apparition
was light</B>
<P><B>enough for me to see.  I said aloud please don't hurt me and said a

quick</B>
<P><B>prayer.  I don't remember how much longer it took me to fall asleep
but the</B>
<P><B>next day I remembered everything and was scared to death.  When my

roomate</B>
<P><B>came out of her room she looked a little frazzled herself. She told
me that</B>
<P><B>the something really strange had happened to her last night.  She heard

a</B>
<P><B>noise in her room and looked up and her clothes in her closet were

moving</B>
<P><B>back and forth like their was a hand running back and forth over her</B>
<P><B>clothes.  She was convinced that she had been haunted as well.  Later

that</B>
<P><B>day we found out the door had been shut to the attic for the upcoming

winter</B>
<P><B>months.  I am not sure if the ghost was mad at us for locking him out
or he</B>
<P><B>was caught outside of the attic but regardless he or she gave us quite

a</B>
<P><B>scare.  We mentioned something to our landlord about the occurence
and he</B>
<P><B>told us that during the Indian Revolution men and women were hid in

this</B>
<P><B>house to be protected from the war.  After sharing my story with others

I</B>
<P><B>found that there are many sightings in the town of St. Peter, most
of which</B>
<P><B>coincide with the history surrounding the town. I am sure there are

many</B>
<P><B>others in the town of St. Peter.</B>

<H3><A NAME=del><B>Hotel Del Coronado Ghost</B></A>
</H3><P><B>By: jrose@commlinks.com</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>Just remembered a strange event that happend to my wife and I at the

Hotel</B>
<P><B>Del Coronado in San Diego, CA. Here it is:</B>
<P>
<P><B>My wife and I were staying at the Del for a wedding. We had heard

that</B>
<P><B>there was a ghost at the hotel, but we didn't know anything of the

details.</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>When we arrived we asked the housekeeper if she had experienced

anything.</B>
<P><B>The lady said there was a room on the fifth floor where you would smell

a</B>
<P><B>very strong odor from time to time, but that she hadn't experienced</B>
<P><B>anything else.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Later, in the gift shop, my wife purchased a book about the ghost --

"The</B>
<P><B>Legend of Kate Morgan" -- and began reading it. We learned, that the</B>
<P><B>"haunted room" was just down the hall from ours. We were in room 3390.

</B>
<P>
<P><B>My wife decided she wanted to "see" the ghost and began "asking" Kate

to</B>
<P><B>make herself known. I told my wife I wanted no part of it and went
to bed.</B>
<P><B>The next morning -- Sunday -- I walked down to Starbucks for coffee
and my</B>
<P><B>wife began packing for the trip home. When she took her clothes out
of the</B>
<P><B>chest of drawers she found a tightly wound ball of black cloth mixed

in</B>
<P><B>with her clothes.</B>
<P>
<P><B>She unwound the ball of cloth and it turned out to be a torn strip
of black</B>
<P><B>lace! This is significant because according to the book, Kate was last

seen</B>
<P><B>alive wearing a black lace dress on the third floor veranda the night

she</B>
<P><B>died. Also, I beleive it said she was wearing the dress when her body

was</B>
<P><B>found on the steps the next morning.</B>
<P>
<P><B>My wife does not own anything made of black lace (poor me) and she

doesn't</B>
<P><B>remember seeing the material in the drawer prior to Sunday morning.
It was</B>
<P><B>entirely empty when she put her clothes in it the first time.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Could just be a coincidence, but it's kind of interesting. We still

have</B>
<P><B>the lace by the way. </B>

<H3><A NAME=civil><B>The Civil War Soldier</B></A>
</H3><P><B>By: eleven@edge.net </B>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B>This is pretty much a combined story of the soldier that haunts our</B>
<P><B>house.He is like a caretaker I guess.It all started when I was about

9</B>
<P><B>years old (I'm19 now).Wehad just moved back into this house.  The

house</B>
<P><B>itself was built right after the Civil War. The landlord use to say

that</B>
<P><B>there were graves dug in the back field and no matter how many times

you</B>
<P><B>plowed over them they settled back the same.Anyway when I was 9  I</B>
<P><B>shared  a room with my little sister.I guess it was about 12:30A.M

when</B>
<P><B>I looked into my dad's room and saw the soldier .He was standing at

the</B>
<P><B>end of my dad's bed . He was wearing a grey uniform and had a long

sword</B>
<P><B>on his left side. By that time Iwas sitting up on the bed trying to

wake</B>
<P><B>my sister  Then he scared me ,he turned ,he looked at me and then he</B>
<P><B>floated out of the room.Then we didn't see him for awhile. Then in

1996</B>
<P><B>we went on vacation and my boyfriend stayed here to take care of the</B>
<P><B>house and animals. He was laying on the couch one night with all the</B>
<P><B>lights out and he heard something in the back of the room.Heturned</B>
<P><B>around and there was the soldier standing by the stereo. He said he</B>
<P><B>turned on the light and left them on all d*** night(those are his

exact</B>
<P><B>words.He didn't believe my stories until then.)</B>
<P><B>      Then in early 1998 after my son was born  he made him self

known</B>
<P><B>again. It was the first time my friend had stayed over . We were

sitting</B>
<P><B>up talking  when the soldier stretched his neck around the corner and</B>
<P><B>scared the life out of her. Well this is getting kinda long  so I

will</B>
<P><B>close for now.Thanx for listening.</B>

<H3><A NAME=ghost><B>The Messenger Ghost</B></A>
</H3><P><B>By: Paige_19@hotmail.com </B>
<P>
<P><B>It happened when I was around ten or eleven. I had always been</B>
<P><B>interested in the supernatural and, being just a kid, I thought it

was</B>
<P><B>rather 'cool' that ghosts were real. So, you can imagine my

astonishment</B>
<P><B>when it happened.</B>
<P><B>I lived in a rather large house, with my mother, father and older</B>
<P><B>brother. My bedroom was the last and the end of a long hallway, and

was</B>
<P><B>far away from the rest of the house. I had a pet Jack Russell

Terrior,</B>
<P><B>named Molly, who always slept in my room.</B>
<P><B>One night, lying in bed, I just could not sleep. It was a very hot</B>
<P><B>night, but for some reason my bedroom was unbelievably cold. Opening

my</B>
<P><B>eyes, I suddenly noticed a strange, silhouette, hovering beside my

bed.</B>
<P><B>I squinted in the darkness, but the harder I tried to make out what

the</B>
<P><B>figure was, the less visible it seemed. Shrugging it off, thinking
it</B>
<P><B>was just me, I slowly drifted back to sleep.</B>
<P><B>But at around 2 am, I was woken up by Molly, whimpering softly.

Sitting</B>
<P><B>up, I noticed an uncomfortable tension under my right arm. Examining

the</B>
<P><B>irritation, I found nothing, but a large, red rash that seemed to</B>
<P><B>dissapear everytime I tried to show it to my parents.</B>
<P><B>I told them about the figure in my room, but I was informed by my

mother</B>
<P><B>that I was probably still sleeping.</B>
<P><B>A few nights later, my room was flushed with coldness again, and once</B>
<P><B>again, I opened my eyes to see that same figure. This time I could

make</B>
<P><B>out a gentle-looking little boy, dressed in tattered rags. His face

was</B>
<P><B>pale, and a glowing 'Aura' (as I call it) shone around his frail

figure.</B>
<P>
<P><B>In the early hours of that morning, Molly woke me up. She was

whimpering</B>
<P><B>again and had gradually made her way up to my chest, where she curled

up</B>
<P><B>to me. I don't understand dogs very well, but I knew she was scared

of</B>
<P><B>something.</B>
<P><B>The rash appeared again that morning and, again, I tried to show my</B>
<P><B>parents. They didn't believe me, as the redness kept coming and

going.</B>
<P><B>Trying to add onto my 'rash' story my sighting of the little boy, I

was</B>
<P><B>pushed out of the room. Dad said that if I lied again like that, I

would</B>
<P><B>be in alot of trouble.</B>
<P><B>My brother was the only one who believed me. He told me he too had

seen</B>
<P><B>the boy, and that he had somehow communicated with it through means
of a</B>
<P><B>Ouija board. I told my brother that I would like to have a word with

the</B>
<P><B>boy also, and so we tried he tried to Oujia board again, but with me</B>
<P><B>present.</B>
<P><B>We got in contact with something that seemed to make the upturned</B>
<P><B>tumbler fog up, and glide around the board. A strange, cold feeling

in</B>
<P><B>the air was all around us. My brother told me it was the little boy

who</B>
<P><B>he was  'talking' to (on the Oujia board) and that I was allowed to

ask</B>
<P><B>some questions, if they were not to offend the ghost.</B>
<P><B>&gt;From that event, my brother and I found out that the boy did not
want to</B>
<P><B>hurt us, but was only there because he too lived in that house. He

(the</B>
<P><B>boy) 'said' that my room was once his room, and that he was my age.</B>
<P><B>We closed the Ouijia board down, and I went to bed as it was late.
I did</B>
<P><B>not sleep a wink that night, knowing that the little boy could be

there,</B>
<P><B>staring at me.</B>
<P><B>Somehow I drifted off to sleep and when I awoke in the morning, I

found</B>
<P><B>something pressed under my arm. It was a folded piece of paper. I

opened</B>
<P><B>it up, but there was nothing on it. No message. No nothing. Just a</B>
<P><B>folded piece of paper.</B>
<P><B>&gt;From then on, the boy continued to leave messages under my arm.
It grew</B>
<P><B>from a small piece of paper, to pencils and one morning I even found

a</B>
<P><B>marble under there!!</B>
<P><B>My brother and I are older now and I have not forgotten the little

boy.</B>
<P><B>But I do not live in that house anymore.</B>
<P><B>I have met up with many Phsycics and Phsycic investigators who help

me</B>
<P><B>to get in contact with the little boy with Ouija Boards.</B>
<P><B>I haven't seen the small boy since I moved out of the house, but I

have</B>
<P><B>not forgotten him, and I know that he never meant me any harm.</B>
<P><B>My parents still do not believe my brother and I to this day, but we</B>
<P><B>know the truth.</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>My name is Cassie, and I would really like anyone who wants to

comment</B>
<P><B>on my experience, or share their experiences with me to e-mail me.

<P><B>One night my aunt was sitting in her living room watching television,

when</B>
<P><B>something caught the corner of her eye. She turned to find a little

girl</B>
<P><B>standing in the doorway of her bedroom. It caught her off guard and
scared the</B>
<P><B>daylights out of her.</B>
<P><B>As she stared at this sweet girl, about 6 or 7 years old, she noticed

the</B>
<P><B>clothing she was wearing. The little girl had on a bonnet and a dress,

kinda</B>
<P><B>like a prairie dress, and she was barefoot.</B>
<P><B>My aunt (being brave) called to the girl, the girl got this look on
her face</B>
<P><B>like"oops your not supposed to see me," and she turned and started
to walk</B>
<P><B>into my aunts bedroom.</B>
<P><B>My aunt jumped off the couch and ran into her room and flipped on the

lights</B>
<P><B>to find that nobody was there.</B>
<P><B>One time I was housesitting for her while she was visiting a friend

in</B>
<P><B>Washington and I was in the house by myself. It was always nice

housesitting</B>
<P><B>for her because I could do my laundry for free!</B>
<P><B>Her laundryroom was downstairs from the kitchen. It was always creepy

in</B>
<P><B>there. There was no ceiling, just rafters. It had a lot of spiders

and</B>
<P><B>cobwebs. The big scary waterheater. </B>
<P><B>I had finished sorting my laundry and stuffed the load in a basket
and started</B>
<P><B>down the stairs.  I set my clothes on the floor and turned around to
open the</B>
<P><B>lid to the washer. As I did a mans voice boomed out of it yelling "BOO!",

now</B>
<P><B>I know that sounds a little funny, but if it was you, you wouldn't
be</B>
<P><B>laughing. I closed the lid and slowly walked up the stairs in shock.
</B>
<P><B>That night I slept on the couch. In the morning I was awakened to

somebody</B>
<P><B>pounding on the walls. At first I thought it was somebody at the door,

but</B>
<P><B>when I looked there was nobody there.</B>
<P><B>The next night I decided to be brave and sleep in one of the bedrooms.

I</B>
<P><B>brought in my book I was reading and laid on the bed  and turned on
the little</B>
<P><B>bedside lamp. I read until my eyes wouldn't stay open anymore. I set
the book</B>
<P><B>on the nightstand next to me and fell asleep with the lamp on.  In
the morning</B>
<P><B>I woke up and the sun was shining through the window, so I rolled over

and</B>
<P><B>turned the lamp off. Just as I rolled back over I heard a voice of
the little</B>
<P><B>girl (who sounded slightly amused) saying,"she turned finally turned
out that</B>
<P><B>light!" I laid there for a while laughing at myself for being so jumpy,

and</B>
<P><B>turned over to grab my book. Only it wasn't there.  I looked and looked

for</B>
<P><B>weeks for that book. I finally found it in a dresser drawer across
the room. </B>
<P><B>I could go on and on with stories you wouldn't believe. </B>
<P><B>My aunt has long since passed away and the house was sold. I always

wondered</B>
<P><B>though if the new owners are having the same experiences that my family
and I</B>
<P><B>had. I guess I'll never know....</B>

<P>
<P>
<P><B>You have so many stories already but here are a couple of mine, My
name </B>
<P><B>is Robert and I live in Queensland Australia,  I have had a few </B>
<P><B>experiences with ghosts, but at the time I had no idea what they were,
I </B>
<P><B>was only about 4 or 5 years old at the time (now 26) but I remember
</B>
<P><B>distinctly several things that would appear in the middle of the night

</B>
<P><B>at the foot of my parents bed, whenever I was sick I would stay in
their </B>
<P><B>room, these things never seemed harmful, more playful really, but they

</B>
<P><B>were in the shape of large animals, like I remember one took the shape

</B>
<P><B>of a kangaroo at one stage, as I said they weren't threatening just
</B>
<P><B>playful, like they knew I was sick and were trying to cheer me up.
 The </B>
<P><B>second thing about the house we used to live in was the hallway to
mine </B>
<P><B>and my sisters bedrooms, ( I have 2 sisters both older than me) in
that </B>
<P><B>hallway we always felt like we were being watched, we never saw anything

</B>
<P><B>but always got that impression, one thing I didn'ttt mention earlier,

</B>
<P><B>the house had been built just before I was born and had no other </B>
<P><B>inhabitants prior to us.  One more thing, the first thing I can remember

</B>
<P><B>in my life is waking up and seeing a witches face in the wardrobe of
the </B>
<P><B>small room at the start of the hall, I know it doesn'tt sound like
much </B>
<P><B>but it was floating there and just shrank away to nothing.  I have
a </B>
<P><B>couple of stories from where we are at the moment as we live next to
my </B>
<P><B>parents workshop/ spare parts truck repair place but that will have
to </B>
<P><B>wait till another time.</B>

</H3><P><B>By: jonj@dakota.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>This happened to me in the Summer of 1997, in South Dakota.  My

Grandmother</B>
<P><B>who had been in a nursing home for about a years passed away one night.

 I</B>
<P><B>remember it like it was yesterday, my girlfriend and I had been out

riding</B>
<P><B>my motorcycle when we got the bad news.  My girlfriend did not live
with me,</B>
<P><B>but that night stayed at my house in order to comfort me.  The House
is a</B>
<P><B>very nice house built in the 1930's, although I do not think that has</B>
<P><B>anything to do with this.  My girlfriend, who is diabetic, and I turned

in</B>
<P><B>for the evening after taking about the loss for a while.  I feel asleep

very</B>
<P><B>fast it seemed and was awaked by my grandma, who passed away that night,

I</B>
<P><B>had not spoken with her in a real conversation in years because age

had</B>
<P><B>taken its toll.  Anyway, she looked younger, a lot younger, yet I knew

it</B>
<P><B>was her.  She told me that I needed to wake up (which I thought I

already</B>
<P><B>was) and help Nicky or she would die, and she wanted to say goodbye.

 Of</B>
<P><B>course I sat straight up in my bed and checked on  Nicky, she was pale

and</B>
<P><B>ice cold, seems she had gone into insulin shock and needed sugar right

away.</B>
<P><B>So I got her up and got everything handled with her and she was fine.

 Not</B>
<P><B>even thinking of what my "dream" had been about until the next day

when</B>
<P><B>Nicky said she had a dream my grandma was in my room.  Was she there?

 I</B>
<P><B>don't know, but I do know that if it would not have happened, Nicky
may very</B>
<P><B>well not be here today.</B>

</H3><P><B>By:  Vy.Bui@connect.xerox.com</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B>	I was reading the ghost stories and they freaked me out.  But I</B>
<P><B>wanted to contribute a story of mine that only me and my sisters share.

 My</B>
<P><B>friend Jason use to live in the house that me and my family live in

now.</B>
<P><B>Jason's use to live there with his parents and his grandmother.  When

Jason</B>
<P><B>was younger his mom and dad were killed while they were on vacation.

 I</B>
<P><B>think they were shot and pushed off a cliff.  I know that sounds so
fake but</B>
<P><B>it's really true.  I don't know if it's Jason's parents that are

haunting</B>
<P><B>our house or something else.  </B>
<P><B>	When we first moved in the basement was just a huge area of space.</B>
<P><B>The walls and the floor was concrete.  My dad fixed up the basement

and</B>
<P><B>built four rooms for us.  It's really nice in our basement now, we

have</B>
<P><B>carpet and a bathroom down there and everything.  Just trying to give
you a</B>
<P><B>bases of the environment around me.  There has always been weird

things</B>
<P><B>going on in that house, but we really never paid much attention to
it.  The</B>
<P><B>first person to ever see anyone was my sister Anh Thu.  Anh Thu is
a really</B>
<P><B>light sleeper.  She wakes up at the slightest noises.  One night me
and my</B>
<P><B>three other sisters were in my room watching t.v, and Anh Thu was in

her</B>
<P><B>room sleeping.  Anh Thu was sleeping when she heard someone with

noisy,</B>
<P><B>swishy pants on enter her room.  She thought it was my little sister</B>
<P><B>Jannete.  Anh Thu kept on asking Jannete what she wanted and she didn't

get</B>
<P><B>a reply.  In Anh Thu's room she has glow in the dark beads that hang

from</B>
<P><B>her ceiling.  Anh Thu said that the figure that she thought was my

sister</B>
<P><B>moved slowly behind the beads and in a split second it disappeared.
 She got</B>
<P><B>so scared so ran to my room and told us about what happened.  Ever

since</B>
<P><B>that night weird things have been happening in our house.  When we
are down</B>
<P><B>stairs you can hear all movement upstairs.  We would hear chair being

moved</B>
<P><B>around in the kitchen, but when we go upstairs to see who was home,

nobody</B>
<P><B>would be up there.  When we are in Anh Thu's room her radio would turn

off</B>
<P><B>and on by itself.  At first it freaked us out but now we are kind of
use to</B>
<P><B>it.  Things would fall in our living room for no reason.  I really
feel that</B>
<P><B>there is someone in our house.  I can't tell if it is a good spirit
or an</B>
<P><B>evil one.</B>

<H3><A NAME=dear><B>My Dear Daughter</B></A>
</H3><P><B>By: Fluffydear@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>  My daughter Diane who was 15 and completed </B>
<P><B>suicide in June of 1985 was as it seems deeply disturbed she had

experimented </B>
<P><B>with drugs, Ouija Boards, black candles and such, she was beautiful
and </B>
<P><B>charming and had many friends but she never got comfortable in her
own </B>
<P><B>skin....there were counselors and lots of help provided .. nothing
worked so </B>
<P><B>one Sunday as the family was out on the grounds she went down stairs
and hung </B>
<P><B>herself ... unfortunately she chose something that was </B>
<P><B>foolproof as far as our being able to rescue her...I stayed in that
huge </B>
<P><B>house for about 5 years after the suicide .. Her brother left for school

and </B>
<P><B>her father and I eventually divorced. Everything around that day seems
a </B>
<P><B>little surealistic..there was An enormous lightening storm that knocked
out </B>
<P><B>the lights in the city for a day or so ....and it seems that every
one around </B>
<P><B>Diane experienced a lot of weird electrical problems....Her best friend

Kelly </B>
<P><B>went to the country home of her father ,, and later she told me that
one </B>
<P><B>night her entire room lit up and looked foggy but with that she got
a sense </B>
<P><B>of peace and slept for the first time in two weeks ....One night my
husband </B>
<P><B>was out driving after a dental meeting and he was seeing the girl walking

</B>
<P><B>along the road in front of him every time he would get close to it
would turn </B>
<P><B>out to be something else .. needless to say he came home visibly shaken.

The </B>
<P><B>television would come on downstairs at least once a week precisely
at the </B>
<P><B>same time around 9:00 PM..My husband said it was an airplane going
over or </B>
<P><B>someone's remote but it had never happened before; I wound up unplugging

it. </B>
<P><B>I knew it was her but no  one wanted to talk about anything let alone

discuss </B>
<P><B>all this stuff. My Son took the car home we had bought for her 16 Th.

</B>
<P><B>birthday. we just couldn't stand to have it there. It s horn would
come on </B>
<P><B>and at one point even drove itself down the street into another parked
car, </B>
<P><B>My son sold the car ... My children rented a condo for me to stay in
for </B>
<P><B>about 2 months following her death. The lights flickered so much (ESP
the </B>
<P><B>chandelier that I finally returned home) I used to paint (Artist)

downstairs </B>
<P><B>and my supplies and easel and such were down there as was her room
and the </B>
<P><B>area she died in... I had to quit because I felt as if  I could  actually

</B>
<P><B>hear some one whispering to me or it was as faint as a whisper; some
times </B>
<P><B>pretty audible sometimes; just very faint. especially if I was lost
in </B>
<P><B>concentration....I am convinced that was her too .. I have not painted

since.</B>
<P><B>the most notable thing began to happen perhaps 6 months after her death
.. I </B>
<P><B>was talking on the phone and sitting on the couch in the great room
..the </B>
<P><B>house was contemporary and its ceiling cathedral and its windows very
high up </B>
<P><B>on one side plus we were sitting atop a fairly high hill so shadows
were not </B>
<P><B>usual as there was nothing to make them...Well while i was talking
i sensed </B>
<P><B>at first someone coming up the spiral staircase ten i saw the shadow
</B>
<P><B>transparent but still a shadow kind of first against the corridor then
it </B>
<P><B>turned in front of me walked past the fireplace and into the bathroom
.. </B>
<P><B>sometimes it would just disappear other times it would reverse and
come back </B>
<P><B>the same way. this was a habit of hers as she always watched TV and
</B>
<P><B>entertained down stairs but there was no bathroom there so would come
up .and </B>
<P><B>take that route to get to the other bath.it never spoke or even stopped

just </B>
<P><B>seem to be doing something out of habit. I eventually had to leave
there as </B>
<P><B>my thought s of her seem to be the first one every morning and the
last one </B>
<P><B>every night .. I have done and am doing much better in my small little

house </B>
<P><B>in a Mr. Rogers neighborhood .. There are times still when strange
little </B>
<P><B>things happen but none like the ones I have told you about ....I do

sometimes </B>
<P><B>wonder if she is still there ....I went to every room of that house
and said </B>
<P><B>the Lords Prayer  and then I went downstairs and talked with her and
told her </B>
<P><B>that i understood and that I hoped she had found the peace that she
so </B>
<P><B>desperately wanted to find but that it was time to go with the light
and that </B>
<P><B>she had completed the suicide and that I was going to be all right
.. I went </B>
<P><B>back upstairs and said good-bye closed the door and I have never been
back. </B>
<P><B>Do you think It was her? And do you think it was OK for me to leave?
I must </B>
<P><B>confess I felt like I was abandoning her. but I was fighting for my
own </B>
<P><B>sanity in a way. Diane had a strong belief in reincarnation and said
she </B>
<P><B>would try to prove it if she were to ever die I don't know what I think

...Oh </B>
<P><B>I should tell you one other story that occured while I was still there

about </B>
<P><B>3 years after her passing. We had this bird thing .. Diane would lay
in the  </B>
<P><B>sun on the balcony watching the birds fly around ..she said if I ever
come </B>
<P><B>back it will be as a bird ..just look at them ,such freedom... well
as I said </B>
<P><B>about 3 years after she had gone we were awakened every morning at
8:00 by </B>
<P><B>this bird pecking on the downstairs window ..directly across from where
she </B>
<P><B>had been ..this went on for the entire summer ..Also when I was in
the </B>
<P><B>bathroom, I could look in the mirror and see a window on the other
side of </B>
<P><B>the house and that same bird use to fly up and down sort of vertically
and </B>
<P><B>look in that window..The bird never let us pick it up or touch it but
it </B>
<P><B>would let us get incredibly close to it and it would just tilt its
head and </B>
<P><B>stare back ..</B>
<P><B>It was a very unusual thing to have happen .. it was there for just
the one </B>
<P><B>summer.</B>
<P><B>I am sure  there are more things, but these stand out in my mind ...Thanks

</B>
<P><B>for your time </B>

<P><B> </B>
<P><B>THE HOUSE I GREW UP IN (17 YRS) WAS HAUNTED.  THE HOUSE WAS AT THAT
TIME </B>
<P><B>ABOUT 80 YEARS OLD, IT WASN'T ACTUALLY A HOUSE,  IT HAD PREVIOUSLY
BEEN NEXT </B>
<P><B>DOOR TO A CHURCH AND USED FOR FUNERAL SERVICES.</B>
<P>
<P><B>THE HOUSE WAS VERY UNIQUE, IT HAD A TOTAL OF 13 DOORS.  MY ROOM ALONE
HAD 3 </B>
<P><B>DOORS; ONE LEADING TO THE LIVING ROOM, ONE TO MY PARENTS ROOM AND ONE

LEADING </B>
<P><B>ONTO THE FRONT PORCH (THAT ONE WAS A SPLIT DOOR).  ALL OF THE DOOR
KNOBS WERE </B>
<P><B>EITHER BRASS OR CUT GLASS AND IT HAD ALL HARDWOOD FLOORS.</B>
<P>
<P><B>SINCE I GREW UP AROUND THE DAY IN AND DAY OUT INCIDENCES OF PARANORMAL

</B>
<P><B>ACTIVITY, IT DIDN'T SEEM STRANGE TO ME AT ALL.  ACTUALLY IT BECAME
SOMEWHAT </B>
<P><B>OF A GAME WITH ME.  I WOULD CLOSE DOORS AND WAIT FOR THEM TO OPEN,
TURN OFF </B>
<P><B>LIGHTS AND WAIT TO HEAR THEM CLICK ON (THE LIGHT SWITCHES WERE LIKE
TWO </B>
<P><B>INCHES LONG AND THEY WOULD CLICK WHEN THEY WERE MOVED).</B>
<P>
<P><B>WHEN I WAS IN MY EARLY TEENS, I BEGAN TO REALIZE THAT THESE SORT OF
THINGS </B>
<P><B>DIDN'T HAPPEN TO EVERYONE AND I THOUGHT IT WAS PRETTY COOL.  THE ONLY
TWO </B>
<P><B>FRIENDS THAT EVENTUALLY AGREED TO STAY OVERNIGHT ONLY STAYED ONCE.
 I MADE </B>
<P><B>THE MISTAKE OF "SHOWING OFF MY GHOST" BY LOCKING THE DOOR TO THE BATHROOM

</B>
<P><B>FROM INSIDE MY PARENTS ROOM AND WALKING AROUND TO THE OTHER BATHROOM
DOOR AND </B>
<P><B>TURNING OFF THE LIGHT AND LET MY FRIENDS EXPERIENCE THE LIGHT COMING
BACK ON. </B>
<P><B> </B>
<P>
<P><B>AS I LOOK BACK, IT IS REALLY RATHER AMAZING THE RELATIONSHIP ME AND
MY SISTER </B>
<P><B>HAD WITH THE SPIRIT.  I AM NOT EXAGGERATING, WE WOULD BE APPROACHING
THE BACK </B>
<P><B>DOOR CARRYING A LOAD OF WET CLOTHES TO HANG OUT AND THE DOOR WOULD
OPEN FOR </B>
<P><B>US.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>MY MOTHER SAW THE SPIRIT ONCE AND SAID IT WAS A YOUNG MAN IN HIS LATE

TEENS, </B>
<P><B>SLENDER WITH DARK HAIR.  SHE THOUGHT IT WAS ONE OF MY BROTHERS SNEAKING

INTO </B>
<P><B>THE HOUSE LATE AT NIGHT AND SHE FOLLOWED HIM INTO THE HALL WHEN HE
JUST </B>
<P><B>VANISHED.</B>
<P>
<P><B>WHEN MY TWO ELDEST SISTERS CAME TO VISIT FROM OUT OF STATE, THE SPIRIT

WANTED </B>
<P><B>TO BE ACKNOWLEDGED.  MY MOM, MYSELF, AND THREE OF MY SISTERS (INCLUDING
THE </B>
<P><B>TWO VISITING) WERE SITTING IN THE LIVINGROOM WATCHING "ALL MY CHILDREN"

WHEN </B>
<P><B>MY BEDROOM DOOR OPENED, WE ALL LOOKED UP AT THE DOOR AND THEN IT SLAMMED

SHUT </B>
<P><B>HARD.  IT WAS SO STARTLING THAT MY MOM GOT HER GUN AND SEARCHED THE
HOUSE </B>
<P><B>SURE THAT IT WAS AN INTRUDER.  THE SAME NIGHT, ALL OF US SISTERS AND
MY ONE </B>
<P><B>YEAR OLD NIECE WERE SLEEPING IN MY ROOM; I WAS ON A COT WITH MY BABY
NIECE IN </B>
<P><B>FRONT OF THE DOOR LEADING OUTSIDE WHEN THE DOORHANDLE STARTED TURNING
AND </B>
<P><B>RATTLING THE DOOR (IT WAS PADLOCK FROM THE INSIDE) AND YOU COULD ONLY
TURN </B>
<P><B>THE DOOR KNOB FROM THE INSIDE.  WELL NEEDLESS TO SAY, MY ELDER SISTERS
WERE </B>
<P><B>SPOOKED.</B>
<P>
<P><B>THAT WAS A TURNING POINT IN THE TYPE OF ACTIVITIES IN THE HOUSE.  IT
REALLY </B>
<P><B>TURNED NASTY.  KNOCKING OUT ALL THE LIGHTS, LOUD STOMPING, RATTLING
DOOR </B>
<P><B>KNOBS AND DOORS LOUDLY, TURNING ON THE STOVE AND JUST A CHANGE IN

ATMOSPHERE. </B>
<P><B> AT THE TIME I GOT REALLY SCARED AND BEGAN TO PRAY A LOT AND IT GOT

BETTER.</B>
<P>
<P><B>MY MOTHER DIED A COUPLE OF YEARS LATER AND I MOVED OUT WITHIN A YEAR
AFTER </B>
<P><B>THAT.</B>
<P>
<P><B>LOOKING BACK, I AM 39 NOW, AND I WAS 17 WHEN I LEFT THAT HOUSE; I THINK

THAT </B>
<P><B>BY PLAYING WITH THE GHOST AND HAVING A FLIPPANT ATTITUDE I  ATTRACTED

ANOTHER </B>
<P><B>SPIRIT WHICH WAS NOT SO NICE.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>WHAT MADE ME WRITE WAS READING YOUR STORY ABOUT ASKING THE GHOST BACK
AND </B>
<P><B>GETTING MORE THAN YOU BARGAINED FOR.  I THINK IN ESSENCE THATS WHAT

HAPPENED </B>
<P><B>TO ME.  NOW THAT I HAVE DONE MUCH READING ON THE SUBJECT AND FROM ANOTHER

BAD </B>
<P><B>EXPERIENCE IN MY SISTER'S RENTAL HOME I KNOW BETTER THAN TO TOY WITH
ANY </B>
<P><B>SPIRIT WITHOUT BEING COMPLETELY PREPARED MENTALLY AND SPIRITUALLY.
</B>
<P>
<P><B>THERE ARE FIVE SISTERS AND WE ARE ALL VERY SPIRITUAL AND SOMEWHAT PSYCHIC;

</B>
<P><B>ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO EACH OTHER.  WE ALL SEEM TO ATTRACT OR
ARE JUST </B>
<P><B>ABLE TO SENSE SPIRITS.  TWO OF MY SISTERS WERE SHARING A RENTAL HOME
HERE IN </B>
<P><B>TAMPA WHEN ONE NIGHT MY SISTER GAIL AND HER BOYFRIEND WERE IN HER ROOM,

THEY </B>
<P><B>WERE SITTING ON THE EDGE OF THE BED TALKING WHEN THEY HEARD A LOUD
"POP" THEY </B>
<P><B>LOOKED UP AND SAW A HAZY ORANGISH GLOW COME OUT OF THE WALL SOCKET
AND HEAD </B>
<P><B>TOWARDS THE DOOR.  THE WAY THEY BOTH DESCRIBED IT IS THAT IT "WANTED
OUT"  </B>
<P><B>THIS FEELING WAS SO INTENSE THAT GAIL'S BOYFRIEND BILL SAID "LET IT
OUT </B>
<P><B>GAIL", SHE SAID "YOU LET IT OUT" IT APPEARED TO GO UNDER THE DOOR.
 THEY SAT </B>
<P><B>THERE STUNNED FOR A MOMENT AND THEN REALIZED MY OTHER SISTER BRENDA
WAS IN </B>
<P><B>HER BEDROOM ALONE.  THEY WENT TO HER BUT SHE HADN'T SEEN OR HEARD ANYTHING.

 </B>
<P><B>TO THIS DAY WHEN BILL TALKS ABOUT WHAT HE SAW HIS ARM HAIRS STAND ON
END AND </B>
<P><B>HIS EYES TEAR, AND BELIEVE ME THIS GUY IS THE BIGGEST SKEPTIC FOR ALL

THINGS </B>
<P><B>SUPERNATURAL YOU'D EVER WANNA MEET.</B>
<P>
<P><B>THE NEXT DAY, BRENDA CALLED ME AT WORK AND SAID SHE WAS GETTING CHILLS
AND </B>
<P><B>COLD SPOTS IN THE HOUSE AND THAT EVERYTIME SHE WALKED UNDER THE HALL
LIGHT IT </B>
<P><B>FLICKERED AND WOULD I COME OVER AND CHECK IT OUT.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I FELT IT INSTANTLY WHEN I WENT INTO THE HOUSE, IT WAS LIKE A THICKNESS
IN </B>
<P><B>THE AIR AND IT SEEMED TO ASCEND UPON ME AND HAD A FAINT ODOR.  I TOLD
IT TO </B>
<P><B>GET OFF OF ME THAT I AM A CHILD OF GOD AND AM COVERED BY THE BLOOD
OF JESUS </B>
<P><B>AND IT DID.  WE OPENED BIBLES AROUND THE HOUSE AND WALKED THROUGH THE
HOUSE </B>
<P><B>SAYING THE PSALMS PRAYER.  IT SEEMED TO BE FOCUSED IN THE CORNER OF
HER </B>
<P><B>BEDROOM CEILING.  DAYS OF PRAYING AND IT WASN'T DISPERSING.  AND THE
LIGHT IN </B>
<P><B>THE HALLWAY CONTINUED TO FLICKER ONLY AS YOU PASSED UNDER IT.</B>
<P>
<P><B>THEN IT GOT REALLY SCARY.  MY SISTERS GRANDCHILDREN; A GIRL 3 AND BOY
4 WERE </B>
<P><B>VISITING FROM ORLANDO WHEN THEY WENT TO BED THEY STARTING CRYING AND

CALLING </B>
<P><B>TO HER.  SHE WENT IN AND THE CHILDREN TOLD HER THERE WAS  A "BAD MAN
WITH A </B>
<P><B>KNIFE IN THE BATHROOM" (THE HALL LIGHT IS DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF THE
BATHROOM </B>
<P><B>DOOR).  SHE SAID TO THE CHILDREN "ITS OKAY HONEY THERES NO ONE THERE"
AND THE </B>
<P><B>GRAND DAUGHTER BRITTANY SAID "YES HE IS GRANDMA, SEE HIM, HES GOT HAIR
LIKE </B>
<P><B>DADDY".  </B>

</H3><P><B>By: GMM110656@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>I'm writing to you because I feel that not even the closest people
really </B>
<P><B>understand what it has been like to be sensitive to the other dimension.
 I </B>
<P><B>have been sensing for years that there definately are spirits of those
that </B>
<P><B>have long been gone from this realm.  It began in 1980, at least this
is when </B>
<P><B>I actually had 'the feeling'.  Although I was alone in the house, 
I felt as </B>
<P><B>though I was being caressed on the head as I slipped into an afternoon

doze.  </B>
<P><B>I immediately awoke, thinking that it may have been my cat, but then
I </B>
<P><B>remembered that he was not indoors.  I only felt frightened for 1/2
of a </B>
<P><B>second a then a peaceful sense of calm came over me.  Perhaps it was
the </B>
<P><B>nature of the way in which whoever it was, chose to visit.  It was
the year </B>
<P><B>that everyone's lives, in my family changed forever.  It was an emotionally

</B>
<P><B>upheaving, distressing year as we learned that my younger brother of
16 years </B>
<P><B>had an inoperable brain tumor.  He was given less than a year to live.

  </B>
<P><B>Perhaps, whoever contacted me, felt that they were assuring me that

although </B>
<P><B>he would not survive this life, he would live on in another and be
in good </B>
<P><B>company.  This thought occurred to me only moments after the incident.
 He </B>
<P><B>left us in February of 1981.  I never have morbid thoughts concerning
his </B>
<P><B>death although I miss him very much, because I know that he is happy
where he </B>
<P><B>is and that he is enveloped in a circle of love.  One that consists
of family </B>
<P><B>members that have gone on before him and ones that have moved on since.
 I </B>
<P><B>have has many instances of paranormal experiences since then.  I am
no longer </B>
<P><B>living in the same house, but I feel that it is not always the place
that </B>
<P><B>prompts these occurrances.  Sometimes, it is the fact that may be open
to </B>
<P><B>believing that it is possible to make contact or for them to make contact

</B>
<P><B>with us, which allows us to sense their presence.  I will write to
you again </B>
<P><B>as many other instances need to be heard by all those who believe and
have </B>
<P><B>had similar experiences.            </B>

<P>
<P>
<P><B>When I was in college I worked on an ambulance in a large urban area
on </B>
<P><B>the weekends. </B>
<P>
<P><B>One bitter January night we got a call of a person down.  When we got

</B>
<P><B>there the cops were standing over an old lady on the sidewalk. She
</B>
<P><B>appeared to be a homeless person-old sick and dying probably from a
half </B>
<P><B>dozen different causes. </B>
<P>
<P><B>We stabilized her as best we could on site and  headed for the ER.
We </B>
<P><B>hadn't gone two blocks when she began to go bad on us.  We did what
we </B>
<P><B>could but she soon stopped breathing. We shocked her, applied CPR but
it </B>
<P><B>was no good. </B>
<P>
<P><B>As the other tech and I sat back in defeat we saw an amazing thing.
It </B>
<P><B>seemed as if 25-30 or more sparkling "butterflies" seemed to rise from

</B>
<P><B>the woman's body and circle in a tight spiral above her in the </B>
<P><B>ambulance. We both believed that we heard a faint, high pitched, </B>
<P><B>"tinkling" sound as well. The spiral climbed to the ceiling, tightened

</B>
<P><B>up an just disappeared before our eyes.We sat in amazement for minutes.

</B>
<P><B>This was in no way scary, in fact it was beautiful, awesome.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Finally the other tech just looked at me, shook his head and said"You

</B>
<P><B>see some strange stuff on this job". I never saw anything like it ever

</B>
<P><B>again and the other tech would never elaborate about the the other
</B>
<P><B>"strange stuff" he had seen. </B>

</H3><P><B>By: C223@rollanet.org</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P>
<P><B>    I used to go deer hunting in western Maryland every fall on

public</B>
<P><B>grounds reserved for that sort of thing.  I would start off at dawn

and</B>
<P><B>use a map and compass to walk about three miles into some pretty</B>
<P><B>desolate sections of this roughly hilled hunting area.  The first time

I</B>
<P><B>hunted the area I discovered the grave of someone's beloved dog. They</B>
<P><B>had  erected a nice cross over the grave with the dog's name and

dates</B>
<P><B>(birth and death). The somewhat chilling thing about this location

was</B>
<P><B>that it was in the middle of the hunting grounds where no one lived.

Yet</B>
<P><B>every time I passed by this grave, dawn or dusk, I could hear a dog</B>
<P><B>barking.  It wasn't threatening. Just repeated barking as if the dog</B>
<P><B>were nearby but I couldn't see it.  When I would walk away the

barking</B>
<P><B>would stop.  This occurred every year for three years.  Makes you</B>
<P><B>wonder.........</B>

</H3><P><B>By: Mitarangel@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>Hi my name is Maria and Iam 23, I have never really believed in ghosts
but I </B>
<P><B>don't think I can deny them(or whatever this was)anymore. Until about
2 months </B>
<P><B>ago I never believed people when they told me ghost stories, scary
movies </B>
<P><B>never frightened me and I never thought ghosts were real until......I
had an </B>
<P><B>apartment with a girlfriend of mine while we were attending college
at UT at </B>
<P><B>Arlington, we lived alone just the two of us and we were getting along

fine, </B>
<P><B>about 3 weeks after we moved into the place I started finding some
of my </B>
<P><B>clothes missing and jewlery, it would wind up in her room. I started

blamming </B>
<P><B>her, and she was blamming me for the same thing( her stuff in my room).
One </B>
<P><B>night I came home from a party and no one was home, everything in the

kitchen </B>
<P><B>was now in the living room, and all my furniture in the living room
was in </B>
<P><B>the kitchen,,,I was so mad assuming it was a practicle joke I went
and </B>
<P><B>confronted her about it, she swore it was not her. These expieriences
were </B>
<P><B>happening more and more and I started to get nervous, thinking that
maybe it </B>
<P><B>was some of our friends.  About two days after I came home from

thanksgiving </B>
<P><B>break, me and my roommate were sitting in the living room(after putting
all </B>
<P><B>the furniture back) when the television started to go on and off, the

kitchen </B>
<P><B>and hallway lights too(not at the same time) we both looked at each
other and </B>
<P><B>I could see the horror in her eyes, soon Sarah's(my roommate) dog a
small </B>
<P><B>jack russel terrior, started barking at the love seat as if someone
was </B>
<P><B>there, but they werent, I couldnt move(the love seat was directly to
my </B>
<P><B>right) I just kept staring. We looked at each other and jumped up,
as we ran </B>
<P><B>to my bed room the lights that surround the bathroom mirrors started
to burst </B>
<P><B>for no reason. We turned directly around and ran for the front door,
Sarah </B>
<P><B>went back to pick up her puppy when he snapped at her( he has never
done this </B>
<P><B>before) she dropped him and he slowly walked into the kitchen as if
someone </B>
<P><B>was calling him, we continued to run out the front door, when I tripped
and </B>
<P><B>fell and landed on my knees and hands, In front of the door were about
11 </B>
<P><B>moving boxes open and filled with our stuff( they were not there before)
We </B>
<P><B>didnt stop to think about it, Tibbo(sarah's dog) was now at the front
door </B>
<P><B>with us, and Sarah grabbed him and we ran all the way to her car and
drove </B>
<P><B>off!...We had our boyfriends go back and get our stuff, I have now
moved in </B>
<P><B>with my boyfriend and Sarah has gone to her mothers. We talked to the

</B>
<P><B>landlady a few days later and she said that no one has lived in this
</B>
<P><B>apartment for longer than 3 months. I dont think anyone has moved in
after </B>
<P><B>us, but I am still watching for them. Just to see if the same thing
happens to </B>
<P><B>them.</B>

<P>
<P>
<P><B>When I came upon this site I found comfort in reading other peoples'

stories. </B>
<P><B>I was never into supernatural stuff. I think I was too scared of the

unknown </B>
<P><B>to read or hear anything about stuff like this, I have had strange
things </B>
<P><B>going in my life since I was a little girl I'm 17 now, I can not explain

</B>
<P><B>these things or rather I don't want to know about them. I will leave
them be and </B>
<P><B>not questioned them for I am too scared to find out the truth, my family

has </B>
<P><B>never stayed in one place we have moved alot from town to town. , I
was born </B>
<P><B>in Albquerque,New Mexico I lived there until I was about 10 or 11.
This is </B>
<P><B>where my story starts when I was about 7. We lived in an apartment
it was very </B>
<P><B>cozy and nice. It was just my mom and my brother and I at the time,ok
well </B>
<P><B>since it was just the three of us I had my own room which I didnt stay
in </B>
<P><B>that much I always managed to sleep in my brothers room,my first encounter

</B>
<P><B>came in this house my mother was working as she always did my brother

wanting </B>
<P><B>to hangout with friends rather then babysit his sister went next door
and </B>
<P><B>left me by myself I was about 8 years old at the time,I was sitting
in the </B>
<P><B>den watching tv and I remember I was getting hungry so I went to the

kitchen  </B>
<P><B>to find some munchies I was standing in the kitchen and I hear my name

being </B>
<P><B>called I thought it was my mother I was so happy I was talking to her
I was </B>
<P><B>like mom I'm in the kitchen I expected to hear her walk in any minute
but it </B>
<P><B>was dead slient except for the tv I called at to my mom at that second
I got </B>
<P><B>really scared I know it wasn't my imagination it was someone who I
thought </B>
<P><B>called my name it was quite clear as if the person who called my name
had </B>
<P><B>been standing next to me, well I started walking around my house calling

for </B>
<P><B>my mom I was getting really scared at this point,as I entered my mothers

room </B>
<P><B>I hear my name again I turned around I said what I was confused I didn't

know </B>
<P><B>what was going on I walked down the hall I was almost in the den area
when </B>
<P><B>again I heard my name being called this time it was more clearer and
I felt </B>
<P><B>very cold to the point where I started to shiver I freaked out and
went </B>
<P><B>running to my neighbors house where my brother was I told him about
it he </B>
<P><B>didn't believe me he said I made it up just so I could be over there
with him, </B>
<P><B>that wasn't true at all I heard what I heard it was very true,in that

</B>
<P><B>apartment many strange things happened which my mother can agree with
one </B>
<P><B>day(this is the strangest I can think of) I was out side playing in
the yard I </B>
<P><B>had my back turned to the house i dont remember what i was doing but
i </B>
<P><B>remember feeling as if I was being watched I turned around and I saw
what </B>
<P><B>looked like a women it wasnt clear enough to make it out I kinda got
scared </B>
<P><B>but I  ignored it and went on playing then from the corner of my eye
I see a </B>
<P><B>women walking up to me I got up quickly becuase there was no way she
could </B>
<P><B>have gotten into my yard unless she came from inside my house I asked
her if </B>
<P><B>she was my mothers friend she didn't reply she just kept walking towards
me </B>
<P><B>the closer she got the more I noticed she was sort of see threw like,
I just </B>
<P><B>stood there I could'nt move couldn't talk I just stood there I was

terrified </B>
<P><B>she walked right through me not passed me but RIGHT through me I felt
like my </B>
<P><B>body was going to shut down I felt so cold it was a hot summer day
the sun </B>
<P><B>out and everything,after a couple of seconds I was able to move again
I ran </B>
<P><B>into the house into my room and started crying I told no one about
this, we </B>
<P><B>finally moved out of that place all my life I have felt like there
is </B>
<P><B>something watching me and I can tell you its the most terrifying thing
I </B>
<P><B>never feel alone even if I am  to this day,I hate the way I feel no
one will </B>
<P><B>believe me they all say I watch too many movies but I rarely watch
tv, I have </B>
<P><B>had times when I hear my name being called when no one is around when

<P><B>fun well toward the middle into the game I asked if the person or ghosts

</B>
<P><B>could prove itself thinking it was my friend who was playing a joke
on me </B>
<P><B>well right after I asked the question the candles we had burning went
out my </B>

<P>
<P><B>About 15 years ago my mother </B>
<P><B>had a cat that my sister had captured when it was a kitten. So she
was always </B>
<P><B>kind of wild If my mother moved Windy would hide for about a week,
</B>
<P><B>finally coming out to eat. If a stranger came to the home Windy would

</B>
<P><B>hide.I moved back into my mother's </B>
<P><B>home Windy and I became very close. She stayed in the basement/garage
of </B>
<P><B>the house. She would cry at the stairs and I would go down to feed
and pet her. </B>
<P><B>I was the only person she would come to. The time came for Windy to
be put </B>
<P><B>to sleep I took her to a friend that worked at the human society they

promised </B>
<P><B>to put her to sleep where there would be no pain. I was so very upset
I </B>
<P><B>cried all night.The next day I was in my </B>
<P><B>bedroom and heard Windy cry down in the basement. I opened the door
and no </B>
<P><B>Windy. I know for sure I heard her. Then I thought, it was her way
</B>
<P><B>of thanking me for taking away her pain plus she was saying good-bye.</B>
<P><B>After that I never heard her again and I felt so much better. What
a </B>

</H3><P><B>By: Guinupb@incentre.net</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>I have had numerous experiences with ghosts in my time , I unlike some

of</B>
<P><B>you dont take this as a pushover subject , I scares me to death.....Most

of</B>
<P><B>my encounters werent all that bad until I moved into my mom's

boyfriends</B>
<P><B>house</B>
<P><B>then things really went scary......Ok to fill you in on some

background</B>
<P><B>information ......My mom's boyfriend's brother used to live in the

house</B>
<P><B>that we do....him and his brother or my mom's boyfriend as I would
call him</B>
<P><B>, they use to live together like a normal family .....then one night
Ed (</B>
<P><B>my mom's boyfriend) got a phone call , his brother had been beaten
to death</B>
<P><B>in some bar fight , he was pronounced dead at the scene. then 6 years

later</B>
<P><B>we move in. A week after we moved in Ed found his brothers motorbike.

Being</B>
<P><B>in good condition he decided to keep it , he brought it into the house

and</B>
<P><B>set it up in the spare room. Then that night I was being a good kid
and was</B>
<P><B>doing the dishes. I took a break and went to the bathroom. I returned

and</B>
<P><B>noticed the fridge was open. there were two feet below so I thought

my</B>
<P><B>little brother was getting something to eat. Not caring to much I went

into</B>
<P><B>the living room to tell my mom that I was almost done. I turned my

head</B>
<P><B>toward her and my mouth dropped open.......Sitting beside her was non

other</B>
<P><B>then my little brother the one who was suppose to be in the fridge
in the</B>
<P><B>kitchen. My mom not knowing about the fridge thing thought I was sick.

she</B>
<P><B>got up and took me back into the kitchen. I quickly turned my head

toward</B>
<P><B>the fridge only to see a shut door. , What happened to it , and whose

feet</B>
<P><B>those were that were sticking out the bottom I will never know.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Now another time was when my brother  (Justin he's 11) he decided to
get a</B>
<P><B>drink in the middle of the night. he climbed up the stairs because
we sleep</B>
<P><B>in the basement , he then turned the corner and saw a man fully

clothed</B>
<P><B>standing just staring at him . Justin thinking it was Ed (my mom's</B>
<P><B>boyfriend) took off back down stairs hoping not to get yelled at. then

the</B>
<P><B>next day when everyone was sitting at the table Justin brought up the</B>
<P><B>subject about the night before. Ed seemed confused and told justin
that 1.</B>
<P><B>he wasn't up in the middle of the night and 2 he wouldn't of had all

his</B>
<P><B>clothes on. Then he went and got a picture and showed justin the face

on</B>
<P><B>it. he asked if that was the guy....and justin without hesitating

replyed</B>
<P><B>"Yeah thats the guy" , not knowing who it was he put a confused look
on his</B>
<P><B>face....then Ed closed his eyes and spit out the words....."That's
my dead</B>
<P><B>brother......."</B>
<P>
<P><B>there are quite a bit more but I wish not to waste your time...I hope

you</B>
<P><B>use these so people can take time to believe in the

supernatural......let</B>
<P><B>us make everyone a believer</B>

I've </B>
<P><B>alway's accepted these events. Yes, I wonder about them,and times a
bit </B>
<P><B>frighten.I did not believe in evil spirits.I refuse to,thinking "why
should i </B>
<P><B>acknowledge evil spirits, it only gives them power". I still believe
this, </B>
<P><B>and want too,except for one event that occured a few years ago. It
was a </B>
<P><B>terrible time in my life. My whole world was crashing. I would stay
the </B>
<P><B>entire day &amp; night in my bedroom. My husband was drinking alot,he
had his </B>
<P><B>problems. Anyway, one evening I was in my bedroom, by myself with the
door </B>
<P><B>closed. I  was thinking about life,and what went wrong.When I heard
a </B>
<P><B>growling sound from under the bed. It was clear &amp; loud. It was
comming from </B>
<P><B>my husband side of the bed. the growl repeated. I search under the
bed, and </B>
<P><B>saw nothing. It stopped, gave it no thought,and continued my evening
of </B>
<P><B>thinking myself to sleep. The following day it happened again,this
time </B>
<P><B>during the day. Again,I look under bed,&amp; saw nothing. And forgot
about it. </B>
<P><B>Meanwhile,the fighting between my husband &amp; I worsened, to the
brink where I </B>
<P><B>wanted to die.This went on for a week.The drinking, fighting and the
</B>
<P><B>growling. Never able to find out the source of the unearthly sound,from

under </B>
<P><B>the bed. I did alot of praying asking for direction. One night,in my

deepest </B>
<P><B>desperation,crying out for help .I wanted to die,or for my husband
to die. I </B>
<P><B>threw myself on my bed,I can't remember what I was saying. I thought
I heard </B>
<P><B>the growl again,and dismissed it.I was crying uncontrolable.When I
felt a </B>
<P><B>small hand patting me on the   shoulder. I stopped crying,and paid

attention </B>
<P><B>to the patting. I knew I was alone in the room. I felt like a child,
a voice </B>
<P><B>in my head kept repeating "it's going to be O.K" I fell asleep,a restful

</B>
<P><B>sleep,which I was unable to do for months. The growling was never heard

</B>
<P><B>again. I still live in the same house,sleep in the same bed,same room.
My </B>
<P><B>marriage and life is O.K. again. It took time. I believe something
was under </B>
<P><B>my bed that caused my life to turn upside down. I know and believe
an angel  </B>
<P><B>came to my aid .Calming me,comforting me and most of all protecting
me. Thank </B>
<P><B>You for letting me share this very real experience. </B>
