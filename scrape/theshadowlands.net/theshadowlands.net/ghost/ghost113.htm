<b>My Great Grandmother</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: TealTinted@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>My mother's grandmother was always proud of my mother.&nbsp; Being
the first in</b>
<br><b>her class, the first in every track race in the state of Pennsylvania,
and</b>
<br><b>the first-born grandchild, my mother held a special place in her
heart.&nbsp; When</b>
<br><b>my mother got married and later became pregnant with me, my great
grandmother</b>
<br><b>was overjoyed.&nbsp; She spent countless hours on the phone with
my mother,</b>
<br><b>discussing names, wallpapers, toys and even colleges for her first</b>
<br><b>great-grandchild.&nbsp; Sometimes my mother thought that she was
more excited to</b>
<br><b>have me than herself.</b>
<br><b>When the time came for me to be born, my mother called her grandmother
before</b>
<br><b>anybody, including the doctor and my father.&nbsp; After eight hours
in labour, my</b>
<br><b>mother was handed a baby girl (who looked more like Winston Churchill
than</b>
<br><b>Emily Lewis) wrapped in the tiny yellow blanket that my great grandmother</b>
<br><b>made for me.&nbsp; A knock came on the door and my mother called
out "Come in!,"</b>
<br><b>expecting my father.&nbsp; In walked my great grandmother, who lived
in</b>
<br><b>Yugoslavia.&nbsp; My mother was overjoyed and held me up so that
she could see me.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;My great grandmother smiled one of those smiles that only
grandmothers can</b>
<br><b>give, her old wrinkled face soft and glowing with pride, and then
walked out</b>
<br><b>of the room.</b>
<br><b>The next day my parents took me home, where my mother received a
devastating</b>
<br><b>phone call.&nbsp; My great grandmother had died peacefully in her
sleep the day</b>
<br><b>before.&nbsp; In her hand was cradled a wooden baby rattle she intended
to give to</b>
<br><b>me when she arrived in America the following week.</b>

<p><b>Haunted in Maryland</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: TLSCHOBERT@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I just typed part of this story but got cut off so if this is sent
twice- I'm</b>
<br><b>sorry. There have been quite a few strange experiances in the lives
of my</b>
<br><b>sister and I. Here are a few of them. When I was very small we lived
in a</b>
<br><b>three story row house in Baltimore MD. All of the floors and stairway
were</b>
<br><b>creaky and wooden. The stairs started from the living room, up and
the</b>
<br><b>landing was right outside my bedroom. In fact my bed was directly
across from</b>
<br><b>it. Whenever someone would go up the stairs each stair would creak
and the</b>
<br><b>landing would creak twice when stepped up on. Every night after
everyone was</b>
<br><b>in bed i would hear someone coming up the stairs. I would call for
my mother</b>
<br><b>and she would always say that it was the house settleing. Which
sounds</b>
<br><b>reasonable but the stairs wouldn't settle from the bottom to the
top in the</b>
<br><b>right order once and then the landing always creak twice like someones
weight</b>
<br><b>was on it. One night I heard someone coming up the stairs (which
I had gotton</b>
<br><b>pretty used to) and up on the landing. but then I heard one of the</b>
<br><b>floorboards betweent tne bedroom door and my bed creak. Then I felt
someone</b>
<br><b>sit on the edge of my bed. I couldn't see them but I felt my bed
go down and</b>
<br><b>the springs squeaked. I screamed till my dad came in. (My dad says
that he</b>
<br><b>always thought that house was haunted and he has his own story to
tell- let</b>
<br><b>me tell you). I never felt anyone on my bed again but I heard those
stairs</b>
<br><b>every night we lived in that house. After that house we moved to
California.</b>
<br><b>We lived in a couple of places before my parents bought a house
in Anaheim.</b>
<br><b>One time my sister was sitting in the hallway right in front of
my closed</b>
<br><b>bedroom door. She was looking down occupied with whatever she was
doing (she</b>
<br><b>was about 9 or 10 when this happened). She said that I came up behind
her,</b>
<br><b>rudely said "Get out of my way!", opened the door, went in and slammed
the</b>
<br><b>door behind me. When the door slammed she happened to look up thru
the glass</b>
<br><b>door into the backyard and saw me playing with Tia our little dog.
So she</b>
<br><b>came out and asked me if I had just gone into my room. I said she
was nuts</b>
<br><b>because she could plainly see i was outside. She told me what happened
so we</b>
<br><b>went into my room and of course no one was there. We were latch
key kids so</b>
<br><b>we were home alone.(This was right after school). That was pretty
creepy but</b>
<br><b>the only thing that happened in that house. She still gets weirded
out about</b>
<br><b>that 11 years later. The most haunted place we ever lived in was
about 5</b>
<br><b>years ago in Burbank CA. I wish I could give the address so you
could go see</b>
<br><b>for yourself but I don't want to get sued by the owners or something.
It was</b>
<br><b>this house that we rented from some people who had to move to San
Francisco</b>
<br><b>right away but didn't want to sell their house. This time it was
just me, my</b>
<br><b>mom and my sister. My parents had since divorced. It was a weird
looking</b>
<br><b>house any way. Not like a typical haunted house but it just had
something</b>
<br><b>really odd about it. We felt kind of creepy about it the first time
we saw it</b>
<br><b>but it was in my moms price range and that is not easy in LA. So
we moved in.</b>
<br><b>The first couple weeks nothing really happened. Than all of the
suddened we</b>
<br><b>started hearing someone walking fast down the hallway past all of
our</b>
<br><b>bedrooms and into the bathroom where they would slam the door. The
floors in</b>
<br><b>this house were creaky and wooden too.(Notice a trend?) Any way
the first</b>
<br><b>night my mom called out from her room to us to see why we had done
that. Well</b>
<br><b>I know that I was still in my bed and my sister called back that
it wasn't</b>
<br><b>her either. This happened a lot. Well by this time I was 18 and
I had a very</b>
<br><b>serious boyfriend (now my hubby) so I stayed the night at his place
a lot.</b>
<br><b>Cool mom huh? Any way from what I was told one night my mom said
at about 1am</b>
<br><b>she heard the front door shut and a female voice say "HI!". She
thought I had</b>
<br><b>come home so she came in my room to see if anything was wrong for
coming home</b>
<br><b>early and I was not there. She looked out front for my truck which
also was</b>
<br><b>not there. Well, I can tell you it wasn't me! Another time my sister
was</b>
<br><b>getting ready for school in her room. She walked out into the living
room to</b>
<br><b>leave and she said there was a man sitting in the rocking chair.
She just</b>
<br><b>stood there staring at him and he stood up, looked right at her
and</b>
<br><b>dissapeared. She said the chair was still rocking as if someone
had just</b>
<br><b>gotten out of it. The front door locked from the inside with a key
and the</b>
<br><b>key was in her hand. Nobody could have just walked in. The last
experiance we</b>
<br><b>had was about a month later. We were sitting in the&nbsp; den one
night watching</b>
<br><b>tv. One of those ads for 40's style music collection cd's came on.
They</b>
<br><b>started to play samples of the songs and from the dining room behind
us we</b>
<br><b>heard a woman singing along. Well since we were all sitting on the
couch</b>
<br><b>together it wasn't one of us. About a week or so after that night
was the</b>
<br><b>Northridge Earthquake and we didn't hear anything after that. Then
again</b>
<br><b>about two weeks after the quake the owners contacted us to say they
wanted</b>
<br><b>thier house back so we moved out. I don't know if anything is still
going on</b>
<br><b>in that house but I do know that the owners sold it less than a
year later.</b>
<br><b>My sister stills lives right down the street from that house and
it is still</b>
<br><b>as creepy looking as always. I havn't had anything happen to me
since then (</b>
<br><b>I moved to San Deigo) but my sister has had some strange things
happen in her</b>
<br><b>apartment. It was used as a sort of military housing for families
in WW2. But</b>
<br><b>nothing like the experiances mentioned above! Anyway that is my
story- sorry</b>
<br><b>so long!</b>

<p><b>What's Happening In My House?</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: Bsc45@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;I live in a very old house with a</b>
<br><b>history I know little of except it dates back to before the Civil
War.</b>
<br><b>I don't think my "friend" is someone who lived in the house before
but</b>
<br><b>someone who knows me and what is in my heart.&nbsp; Sometimes, I
think I catch a</b>
<br><b>glimpse of a person standing down the hall out of the corner of
my eye.&nbsp; It</b>
<br><b>doesn't register that I have seen something until I have walked
on.&nbsp; When I</b>
<br><b>turn around to look, of course, there is nothing to see.</b>
<br><b>As I mentioned in my first letter, I was 17 the first time I experienced</b>
<br><b>seeing a spirit.&nbsp; My grandfather had died a few weeks earlier.&nbsp;
One Sunday</b>
<br><b>the family was having lunch with my grandmother.&nbsp; I was fixing
drinks and</b>
<br><b>turned to see him sitting in his favorite chair.&nbsp; In the time
it took me to</b>
<br><b>say something to someone, he was gone.&nbsp; I had no more experiences
for about</b>
<br><b>20 years that I can recall.</b>
<br><b>I saw a woman on two separate occasions.&nbsp; The first time my
neighbor saw her</b>
<br><b>at the same time.&nbsp; I never saw her again but always felt her
presence after</b>
<br><b>that.&nbsp; Does that make sense?&nbsp; I have since moved from
that house.&nbsp; One night,</b>
<br><b>while still living there, I was having trouble sleeping.&nbsp; I
was hot and I had</b>
<br><b>kicked the covers off.&nbsp; I heard a noise in the living room.&nbsp;
(It was the day</b>
<br><b>after Christmas and a few empty boxes were still in the floor.)
I thought my</b>
<br><b>cat was playing with the boxes and dismissed it until a woman leaned
over my</b>
<br><b>bed, pulled the covers up and said to me "I'm sorry to wake you
but you were</b>
<br><b>cold." I can't say if she walked away or vanished but she was gone.&nbsp;
I heard</b>
<br><b>the boxes move again.&nbsp; This was not the same woman I saw previously.&nbsp;
I have</b>
<br><b>no idea who she was.&nbsp; Her head was covered in a turban-like
hat.&nbsp; She had a</b>
<br><b>very soothing but indistinct voice.&nbsp; This was not a dream.&nbsp;
I was fully awake</b>
<br><b>at the time!</b>

<br><b>Spirits with Me</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: cdilts5@avonil.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp; I belong to a club here on the internet and 2 of my friends
recommended your site to me.&nbsp; We, my husband and I, have lived in
this 100 yr old house for 7 yrs now.&nbsp; We first noticed something wasn't
right in here when we heard music playing.&nbsp; That was first and then
came someone running across our floor upstairs.&nbsp; It sounds like a
child.&nbsp; Our 4 yr old son has seen an Angel for the past yr.&nbsp;
He talks to her all of the time.&nbsp; Last Sunday we were making a lazy
day of it, since we both work opposite shifts at a factory, and my son
was laying behind me on the couch.&nbsp; All of the sudden he said, "Do
you love me?"&nbsp; and I answered, "Of course I do".&nbsp; He told me
he wasn't talking to me.&nbsp; He was talking to his Angel.&nbsp; He got
down on the floor with his right cheek laying on the hard wood.&nbsp; He
says he has to get down there in order to see her.&nbsp; He also told us,
on this day, she has no legs for her Father cut them off.&nbsp; He has
seen pictures of Angels before so he knows she is an angel because of the
wings.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; We let my sister in law live here with us and she did witchcraft
in our upstairs.&nbsp; We had things happen to us that scared us so we
had a priest come in here and bless our house.&nbsp; Things calmed down
for quite awhile.&nbsp; The things that happen in our house now is feelings
of someone watching you, my husband seen a young man in a straw hat looking
at the sky outside of one our barns.&nbsp; There was a young guy that got
hurt in the barn many yrs ago and the story goes that they brought him
inside this house and he then died.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; My cousin and her husband lived here and they just told me
a couple of months ago that they used to hear music in here also.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; I have only seen one spirit in this house and it was of an
older gentlemen in a blue suit with a black hat on.</b>

<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>Just wanted to add a little to the St James Hotel in</b>
<br><b>Cimarron New Mexico as well as it's Cemetary.&nbsp; We had</b>
<br><b>decided to go for my birthday in October of last year.&nbsp; We</b>
<br><b>stayed for the weekend.&nbsp; (by the way, the rooms are great)!</b>
<br><b>On Saturday we took a trip into Taos and then back.&nbsp; With</b>
<br><b>time still left of the afternoon we found the local</b>
<br><b>cemetary.&nbsp; We found the original owner of the St James and</b>
<br><b>his family buried there.&nbsp; I inadvertantly stepped on Mary's</b>
<br><b>grave.&nbsp; then we stood back to take some pictures.&nbsp; The</b>
<br><b>graves were in a completely shaded area but one of my</b>
<br><b>pictures shows light around one of the tombstones.&nbsp; No</b>
<br><b>matter what angle the pictures were taken, Henry Lamberts</b>
<br><b>gravestone is blacked out but his wifes headstone (which is</b>
<br><b>exactly like Henry's) came out fine in the same picture.</b>
<br><b>That evening is when all kinds of crazy things began to</b>
<br><b>happen.&nbsp; While eating dinner, the waitress was walking</b>
<br><b>through the room with a tray and it looked like someone just</b>
<br><b>came right up underneath the tray and slapped it out of her</b>
<br><b>hands.&nbsp; We were talking to the people that were staying in</b>
<br><b>Mary's room.&nbsp; We went in this room and the smell of lavender</b>
<br><b>was overwhelming.&nbsp; Mary's room is right nest to TJ's room</b>
<br><b>(17).&nbsp; We have pictures down the halls of aparitions and</b>
<br><b>spent the night being pulled off of the bed by our feet (we</b>
<br><b>were in the Jesse James room).&nbsp; It is definate;y a fun</b>

<p><b>"Mr Miller"</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: liquidator66@yahoo.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>As promised, the first of my stories goes as follows:</b><b></b>
<p><b>My mother and her family, being her parents and 11</b>
<br><b>other brothers and sisters, grew up in East London</b>
<br><b>during the first quarter of this century.&nbsp; No, not</b>
<br><b>"east-London", England, but rather a (then) small port</b>
<br><b>on the south-eastern coast of South Africa.&nbsp; My mother</b>
<br><b>was the youngest of six daughters and, in fact, the</b>
<br><b>youngest of the family.&nbsp; At the time the events</b>
<br><b>described below took place, she was about 10 years</b>
<br><b>old, which means that the year was 1936.</b><b></b>
<p><b>The family lived in a house situated at 20 Park</b>
<br><b>Street, which was connected to the bakery premises</b>
<br><b>next door.&nbsp; In fact, at least two of my uncles worked</b>
<br><b>at the bakery, which was called "Model Bakery".&nbsp; My</b>
<br><b>mother told me that the house in Park Street had a</b>
<br><b>"reputation" as the family were always experiencing</b>
<br><b>weird happenings.&nbsp; These included the children hearing</b>
<br><b>windows open and close at night - in rooms that nobody</b>
<br><b>could get into; and the cat and the dogs going</b>
<br><b>ballistic - when no one was there (the usual things</b>
<br><b>for strange houses).</b><b></b>
<p><b>The bakery, and their house, was owned by an elderly</b>
<br><b>Jewish gentleman, called Mr Miller.&nbsp; My mother</b>
<br><b>described him to me as having "quite a kind heart" but</b>
<br><b>being generally grumpy and upleasant to speak to.&nbsp; She</b>
<br><b>said that the younger children in the family (herself</b>
<br><b>included) always used to tease him, despite the fact</b>
<br><b>that he was elderly and not in very good health.</b><b></b>
<p><b>One evening, my mother and two of her sisters,</b>
<br><b>Jeanetta (about 12 years old at the time) and Edna</b>
<br><b>(about 16) were coming home from the local cinema, The</b>
<br><b>Capital, at about quarter to ten at night.&nbsp; They were</b>
<br><b>walking home down the middle of Park Street, after</b>
<br><b>having bought sweets, and the Weekly Standard</b>
<br><b>newspaper, at the local store when Edna remarked that</b>
<br><b>Mr Miller was walking up the street towards them.&nbsp; My</b>
<br><b>mother remembers that he was wearing his usual</b>
<br><b>clothes, being grey pants and a gray jacket, and</b>
<br><b>wearing a grey cap.&nbsp; The girls decided that they had</b>
<br><b>better greet him and, as he passed, they all said</b>
<br><b>hello.&nbsp; Although they looked directly at him when they</b>
<br><b>spoke, he did not answer, and Jeanetta remarked that</b>
<br><b>it was just like him not to say hello to them as he</b>
<br><b>was that mean.&nbsp; They then watched him walk right down</b>
<br><b>the street, away from them.</b><b></b>
<p><b>They continued on home and told their mother, my</b>
<br><b>grandmother, of their encounter with the mean old Mr</b>
<br><b>Miller.&nbsp; She looked at them somewhat strangely, and</b>
<br><b>then told them that Mr Miller had died at home at 7pm</b>
<br><b>that night, about three hours before they had seen</b>
<br><b>him...</b><b></b>

<p><b>The Dining Room</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: FleshEater99@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>In 1992 my parents and I moved into a house in the nicer part of
town. It was</b>
<br><b>my stepfather's grandmother's house, and she had recently died in
her</b>
<br><b>bedroom, which we later converted to a dining room. Following her
death, his</b>
<br><b>grandfather passed away on the kitchen floor due to "trauma." Anyhow,</b>
<br><b>the night we moved in, I remember my parents feeling proud of their
first</b>
<br><b>real house together. Upon the first night of moving in, though,
my stepfather</b>
<br><b>had strange dreams about a black creature with glowing eyes chasing
him</b>
<br><b>around the house. It freaked him out so much he woke up screaming
and my</b>
<br><b>mother had to calm him down. To make an extremely long story short,
I have</b>
<br><b>included some strange events that took place over the 7 years of
our</b>
<br><b>residence:</b>
<br><b>* the telephone would ring off the hook! My parents blamed me, saying
that it</b>
<br><b>was my friends. They stopped when the doorbell started doing the
same; my</b>
<br><b>stepfather would hide in the driveway to see who it was.</b>
<br><b>*Friends that came over would get freaked out for NO reason whatsoever.
On</b>
<br><b>one occasion, my best friend came running up the stairs from the
basement</b>
<br><b>saying she heard someone down there.</b>
<br><b>*When my stepfather went away on buisiness trips, my mom and I would
be</b>
<br><b>alone. On more than one occasion, she asked me the following morning
why I</b>
<br><b>had been up so late making noise around the house, only I wasn't.</b>
<br><b>*After school I would stay alone for about an hour, and usually
I was so</b>
<br><b>scared I'd lock myself in my room until someone got home. One vacation
I had</b>
<br><b>to stay home and keep an eye on the house... I was SO SCARED I ran
outside in</b>
<br><b>the backyard just to get out of there!</b>
<br><b>*In the end, before moving, things got strange. In the basement,
from nowhere</b>
<br><b>came the shape of a foot on the cement; it was so strange! At night
I would</b>
<br><b>hear what sounded like footsteps on the roof above my bed ( which
my parents</b>
<br><b>said were squirrils. ) I believe that my parents knew something
I didn't and</b>
<br><b>that they didn't want to supply me with the information. But when
I started</b>
<br><b>hearing faint polka music from my bedroom ( which was directly above
the</b>
<br><b>dining room ) I told my parents and my stepfather solemnly explained
that his</b>
<br><b>grandmother listened to polka music during the times when she had
been</b>
<br><b>bedridden. It was extremely scary, and I hated that house from the
beginning.</b>
<br><b>Thank you very much for reading my story, maybe it will let others
know they</b>
<br><b>are not alone at all.</b>

<br><b>The House on Coal River Road</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: LOREE63@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>When I was about nine years old my parents rented a small house on
Coal River</b>
<br><b>Road. It was probably built in the Twenties or Thirties and we lived
there in</b>
<br><b>the 1970s. The front door opened into a large living room which
formed one</b>
<br><b>side of the house. Three doors led off down the left hand side of
the room.</b>
<br><b>One opened into a small bedroom, the next into the bathroom and
a third into</b>
<br><b>the kitchen. The house had exits on all sides. A long back porch
looked out</b>
<br><b>over the river. It should have been a pleasant place to live, but
I had</b>
<br><b>nightmares about the house for years after we moved, even after
I was married</b>
<br><b>and had a child of my own.</b>
<br><b>Since the house had only one bedroom, I was given a corner of the
large</b>
<br><b>living room as my "room." One night as I was sleeping, I woke feeling
sick</b>
<br><b>and as I looked around in the dim light I saw I woman sitting on
the floor</b>
<br><b>near my bed. She was sitting "Indian" style and her head was covered
with</b>
<br><b>hair rollers. She was rocking back and forth and appeared to laughing,
but I</b>
<br><b>couldn't hear a sound. Nothing. The woman didn't seem scary, but
I knew she</b>
<br><b>was not my mom and that she was not supposed to be there. I started
screaming</b>
<br><b>for my mother and she came. Of course, the woman was gone and my
mom told me</b>
<br><b>I was dreaming and gave me some medicine and told me to go back
to sleep.</b>
<br><b>Another time I awoke to the smell of bacon and coffee and the sounds
of my</b>
<br><b>parents talking in the kitchen as my dad prepared to leave for work.
I felt</b>
<br><b>all cozy and safe and decided to go back to sleep. I rolled over
and saw an</b>
<br><b>oval shape like a picture without a frame hanging in the air a few
feet from</b>
<br><b>my bed. The picture was of a kind looking old lady with white, smooth
hair,</b>
<br><b>blue eyes, and a flowered cotton dress. Her expression was calm
and pleasant.</b>
<br><b>We did not have any pictures like that in the house and what we
did have did</b>
<br><b>not float in the air. I looked away for a second and when I looked
back it</b>
<br><b>was of course, gone.</b>
<br><b>The only really frightening thing that happened to me while living
in the</b>
<br><b>house was a terrible dream I had in which someone I loved very much
was</b>
<br><b>abusing me in ways I didn't even know people used to hurt each other.
I had</b>
<br><b>no actual knowledge at all of what I had seen in my dream, but it
was so real</b>
<br><b>that I avoided the person in real life for a week. Only later when
I was</b>
<br><b>older did I learn people really did what I dreamed about. And no,
the dream</b>
<br><b>was not a result of something that really happened that I "blocked"
out when</b>
<br><b>awake.</b>
<br><b>After we moved from the house, my mother admitted that she was terrified
of</b>
<br><b>being alone in the house. After dad went to work and I left for
school she</b>
<br><b>would sit frozen on the couch feeling something was standing behind
her and</b>
<br><b>that if she turned around she would see something awful. My dad
said he would</b>
<br><b>have moved us out in a minute if he had known what was going on.</b>
<br><b>As the years passed I dreamed of the house about three or four times
a year.</b>
<br><b>In the dream dusk would be falling and I would find myself alone
in the</b>
<br><b>house. Usually I had been forced to move back again and could not
leave.</b>
<br><b>Nothing bad would happen in the dream except for the feeling that
something</b>
<br><b>was there and it was</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;oppressive and bad and that I couldn't get away. Almost always
I would wake</b>
<br><b>up scared to death, in a panic. The dream would come just often
enough for me</b>
<br><b>to forget about it for a while.&nbsp; It doesn't happen anymore,
but it went on</b>
<br><b>for about 15 years.</b><b></b>
<p><b>The only thing that I know about the house is that the woman who
owned it for</b>
<br><b>years died there and was found by a neighbor who noticed he hadn't
seen her</b>
<br><b>for a few days. She was on the couch and probably died in her sleep.
I never</b>
<br><b>felt she was the one who haunted the house, at least not the cause
of my</b>
<br><b>dreams or the awful feelings my mother experienced.</b>
<br><b>To me the strangest part of this is that I was more afraid of the
dreams I</b>
<br><b>had of the house than I ever was of really living there. The house
itself was</b>
<br><b>torn down a short while after we moved.</b><b></b>

<p><b>The Porcelin Doll</b>

<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>It was about four years ago, and I was staying over my friends house,
she has</b>
<br><b>a big family so when I went to stay with her I stayed with all her
bothers</b>
<br><b>and sisters too and they told me all these ghost stories, and one
about her</b>
<br><b>porcelin bride doll saying the it was haunted.&nbsp; I thought they
were just</b>
<br><b>"pullen my chain" and they would keep saying it was true and the
next day I</b>
<br><b>would come to find out how true those stories were.&nbsp; Well the
next day mostly</b>
<br><b>everyone went to the grocery store so it was only me my friend and
her baby</b>
<br><b>sister at the house and it was boring cause my friend had to do
chores and</b>
<br><b>didnt want my help so I had to find something to do.&nbsp; So I
went into her bed</b>
<br><b>room and I started to play with her porcelin doll, being cocky and
moving it</b>
<br><b>around saying "your not haunted", then I looked into its eyes and
they seemed</b>
<br><b>as if they had life and I mean like real eyes so that freaked me
out and I</b>
<br><b>turned the doll around to face the wall and then I went to the other
side of</b>
<br><b>the room to look at some books.&nbsp; I shruged the eye thing off
as being my</b>
<br><b>imagination and tried to read the book but shortly I got this eerie
feeling</b>
<br><b>that you couldn't just ignore, so I turned around and the porcelin
doll was</b>
<br><b>looking dead at me.&nbsp; I almost died on the spot I knew I turned
it around and</b>
<br><b>it also had its hand up as if pointing at me, for a second I thought
maybe</b>
<br><b>its my friend trying to scare me but the floors in their house are
made of</b>
<br><b>wood so everytime you take a step it creeks, it was quiet the whole
time so</b>
<br><b>when I realized that I shot out of the room like a canon, I mean
I literally</b>
<br><b>jump clear over her bed to get out of there.&nbsp; And when I reached
her I told</b>
<br><b>her exactly everything that happened and all she said was "see I
told you</b>
<br><b>this house is haunted, no one ever believe me" and from then on
I believed</b>
<br><b>her. Later on when we went back in her room cause I wouldn't go
back without</b>
<br><b>her the doll was in its original postion before I turned it before
it moved</b>
<br><b>its self, other stuff has happened in that house and that I have
experienced</b>
<br><b>myself but I'll save that for another story.</b>

<br><b>Elevator Madness</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: JPerlowski@StarTrekMail.Com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;My fiancee' and I needed to post this story for your readers,
because it</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;felt like quite a serious experience. It all happened one
evening when</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;the three of us, that is Leann (soon to be wife), myself and
my mother</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;decided to travel to New York City. We were given free tickets
to watch</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;a guest speaker of a famous learning annex, and thought it
would make a</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;good time for Leann (who is originally from Kentucky) to see
the sights.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;The evening progressed well, and everyone was in an inquisitive
mood to</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;see just how much of a "charlatan", or perhaps justified this
particular</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;orator was, in certain occult circles. As we arrived at this
old post</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Victorian building, my fiancee' immediately felt a certain
unsteadiness,</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;but decided to keep it to herself. I walked into the place
feeling</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;absolutely nothing out of the ordinary, and my mother seemed
the same.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;We went into the adjacent room that led to a semi enclosed
corner where</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;the elevators were, and all three of us stood with a group
of other</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;people awaiting our turn. Nothing seemed strange at this point,
as we</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;were talking about what we were going to see, and what floor
it was on.</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;As the door opened to this relatively old fashioned elevator
(small in</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;all senses of the word), three people walked inside (a woman
an two men)</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;and moved over to the end. It was then that Leann followed,
my mother,</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;myself and a man. All told it was 7 people cramped into a
space no</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;larger than 2 (Fatty Arbuckle) coffins fit together. Immediately
the</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;elevator door closed, and then nothing....</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Now picture this. About 2 minutes pass by. Right before the
doors</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;closed, I had joked to the man that walked in with me last,
that this</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;particular place was very claustrophobic. He smiled and turned
to the</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;door. Just proceeding my words, as the elevator doors closed
shut, there</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;was no elevation. In actuality, there was nothing but the
breathing of</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;people closely knit, and the deafening silence that seemed
to foretell a</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;serious problem indeed.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;This is what happened next in order:</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;1. The woman that came in with the three people in the beginning
began</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;to shake and thrust out her hands wildly, punching the various
buttons</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;on the elevator wall, and loudly exclaiming to no one in particular</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;that, "I have to get out...let me outtttt".</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;2. Leann stared at the woman's movements, beginning to feel
the initial</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;shock of helplessness in so shut in a space, and watched as
for some</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;reason one of the men that was next to the lady, began to
move his</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;fingers in unison with hers. He was mumbling something under
his breath,</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;and Leann, although concentrating more on staying calm, noticed
that the</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;hands of both the lady and the man seemed to intertwine...almost
as if</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;they were moving as one hand all along.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;3. I looked to the elevator's buttons on the wall, and noticed
the woman</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;ONLY punching thus, but then quickly turned my attention to
the man that</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;was standing next to me, who smiled, exclaiming that there
was "plenty</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;of air coming in from the ceiling of the elevator".</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;4. As soon as the man spoke, I felt somewhat relieved by looking
at the</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;ceiling, and then peered downwards and took a count of the
people in the</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;room... I counted "5".</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;5. Also, as the man said this, the entire place went from
about 65</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;degrees or so, to well over 95 degrees and climbing. The room</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;immediately took on a stagnant acrid atmosphere, and everyone
began to</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;sweat profusely.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;6. The same man, seeming to be in control of his nerves, stated
almost</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;at the same time that I did, that perhaps the elevator could,
"go down</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;if we pressed the lower number than what this contraption
may have</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;already arisen to". The funny thing is, that we never moved
nor felt any</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;movement the entire time the doors were closed.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;7. My mother immediately turns to me and says in a very low
key voice,</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;"I don't feel so well, I think I am going to faint".</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;8. At this point, I tell her to calm down, and turn back to
the man,</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;watching as he gently presses the number 2, and waits.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;9. Nothing....At this point, I can feel the panic beginning
to increase</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;in everyone's mindset.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;10. About another minute or so passes, and the door opens
on the second</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;floor; a waive of cool air from the building's air conditioning
ducts</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;hitting the entrance to the elevator, and then...</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;First comes out the man, followed in no short order by myself,
Leann, my</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;mom, and finally the lady. We move to the stairwell, having
at this</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;point the feeling that the elevator, "aint gonna make it!",
and then</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;begin to proceed to climb the stairs...or do we? Well, 5 of
us seem to</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;have, but what of the other two? It seemed to both myself
(after she</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;made me aware of it) and Leann, that these other two men never
made it</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;out of the elevator, and it was bothering us the entire evening</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;afterwards. So much so, that we called my mother later that
night, and</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;asked her how many people she had seen inside that elevator.........her</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;reply was a very adamant, "5".</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;In conclusion to this, both my mother, myself and Leann could
easily</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;take a lie detector test and swear that this elevator never
moved the</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;entire time we were in it. There was no lift, no downwards
motion, no</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;motion at all...yet it somehow landed on the second floor
of this 8 to</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;10 floor building. There was no noise as to the machinations
of the</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;elevator's motor or tow line, and the electricity stayed on
the entire</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;time. Since you can only exit the elevator from the one sliding
door,</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;and the stairwell is the only one that could get you up or
down the</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;various levels of the building, there was no other way to
go. The people</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;on the second floor were just as surprised to see us, as we
were to see</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;them. I couldn't help telling everyone there in a very timid
voice that</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;this elevator has to be fixed.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Leave it to say, we won't be taking a ride on any elevators
for a long</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;long long long time!</b>

<br><b>Dream Grandmother</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: Halien9200@cs.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I have enjoyed your site immensely.</b>
<br><b>I had an experience, but it was in the form of a dream.&nbsp; Allow
me to tell you</b>
<br><b>the story, and I would appreciate your opinion.</b>
<br><b>Last year, my grandmother died suddenly of a heat attack.&nbsp;
I loved her very</b>
<br><b>much, and was quite sad about her passing.&nbsp; At this time in
my life, I had</b>
<br><b>just split up with my boyfriend and was buying a house. A few weeks
before I</b>
<br><b>closed on the house, Barney who was my dog and very best friend
in the whole</b>
<br><b>world got killed. With all of these stressful events, after Barney
died I was</b>
<br><b>quite devastated.&nbsp; A few weeks after his death, I had a dream.
I was in a</b>
<br><b>hotel about to get on an elevator, and presumably a hotel employee
stopped me</b>
<br><b>and told me I had guests.&nbsp; I turned around and saw my grandmother
walk up to</b>
<br><b>me with Barney. She greeted me with a term of endearment she used
for me</b>
<br><b>often when I was a child.&nbsp; I was not scared,&nbsp; because
it was so vivid, and I</b>
<br><b>have never had another dream like this once since (about a year
ago).</b><b></b>
<p><b>Being a rational, and I believe somewhat intelligent person, I could
very</b>
<br><b>easily dismiss this dream as my subconscious wanting them to be
together</b>
<br><b>wherever spirits dwell.</b>
<br><b>One seemingly inconsequential detail stuck out in my mind. My grandmother,</b>
<br><b>who was a very beautiful woman, always complained about her hair
looking</b>
<br><b>messy or unkempt, even though she was always well groomed. When
I saw her in</b>
<br><b>this dream, her hair was perfect, and as always she looked beautiful.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Thank you for taking the time to read my story, I don't know if you
can use</b>
<br><b>it for anything, but I really wanted someone else to read it.&nbsp;
If you have</b>
<br><b>any comments, my address is halien9200@cs.com.</b>
<br><b>Thank you!</b>

<br><b>Composer Poster</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: Jeannie</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I hope that you dont think Im pyhcotic. Actually, a few short months
ago,I would not,even in my wildest dreams, looked up ghosts on the net.
I even feel crazy telling anyone about this.Its not like I havent had paranormal
experiences before,but I would generally put them on my "ignore" mode.
Ive seem mists on a few occasions.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Well here it is. About a year ago,I put up a poster of a 19th century
classical music composer in my office .I work for a local pbs&nbsp; station,and
another employee though that I would like it. Everything was normal for
about nine months.Then one day,I started feeling a strange warmth every
time I looked at this poster.At times I would feel that someone was behind
me,but when I looked back,noone was there.</b>
<br><b>There was just the picture starring at me. Might I add, this composer
is not very attractive.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Nothing in my life had changed that might trigger "crazy" feeling.
Ive had the same</b>
<br><b>job, same boyfriend,and many of the same friends for the past eight
years.If anything, my life is less turbulent than it was before.</b><b></b>
<p><b>As time went by, I felt a strange compulsion to write a ghost story
about&nbsp; the essense of this artist in our time. I havent even as much
as kept a journal for absolute eons.And,as you can tell,my sentence structure
and grammatical skills are less than to be desired.</b><b></b>
<p><b>You are probably thinking that this doesnt sound like an inordinate
situation.However,somewhat esoteric events have been taking place sinse
i started the story. For instance, Ive smelled the scent of lilacs in my
livingroom when they wernt in season. also,my usual french roast coffee
smelled and tasted profusely of cinnamon. I looked all over my kitchen
for a natural cause but couldnt find one.On one occasion,my computer turned
on at six oclock in the morning all by itself.</b>
<br><b>Everyone else,including my cats, was sleeping.</b><b></b>
<p><b>In addition, Im remebering events,from my childhood,long forgotten,
that I couldnt explain.</b>
<br><b>When I was a child,I can remember playing with certain toys that
I couldnt find later on. I can remember searching the attic for a doll
with ivory, high heel shoes that looked like they were woven like frilagree.
My parents said that I must have dreamed it up. Other than my computer
turning on,Ive been able to use all thise events in my story.</b>
