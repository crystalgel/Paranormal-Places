<P>
<P><B>  My story has to do with things</B>
<P><B>that happened to me as a child.  When I was 6 years old my parents
bought a</B>
<P><B>very old house, probably around 100 years old, and that was back in
1976.</B>
<P><B>It was a very large house and some of the original wall paper was still
in</B>
<P><B>it.  I have always been kind of in tune with the supernatural and I
also</B>
<P><B>have a psychic sense.  I'm not saying I am psychic but I just know
things</B>
<P><B>and I can't explain it.  </B>
<P><B>Well anyway, I know that my sister was very afraid of this house. 
She is 3</B>
<P><B>years younger than me.  She would either sleep with my parents or with
me</B>
<P><B>and she would never cross the long hall that ran through the center
of the</B>
<P><B>house by herself.  I know that one day I was sitting in the living
room and</B>
<P><B>I got this really weird feeling.  Like I wasn't the only one in the
room</B>
<P><B>.....I felt like someone was starring at me.  Now keep in mind that
my</B>
<P><B>mother and sister had gone to the store so I was in the house alone.
 At</B>
<P><B>this time I was about 9 years old.  I was sitting on the floor and
I just</B>
<P><B>happend to look up.  If you are familiar with old houses you know that
osme</B>
<P><B>have these glass windows at the top of each door that I guess people
used</B>
<P><B>for ventilization befor air conditioning was invented.  Well, the
upstairs</B>
<P><B>of this house had been added years after the original one story had
been</B>
<P><B>build and the steps that lead upstairs went even with the glass window
above</B>
<P><B>the door in the room I was in.  There was also a small triangle of
wood that</B>
<P><B>was missing frome the step and that is where my eyes shifted to.  There
was</B>
<P><B>something looking at me through that space.  I was so scared that I
grabbed</B>
<P><B>my dog and ran to the front proch just hoping my mother would drive
up.  I</B>
<P><B>don't know what it was but there was something there.  People in the</B>
<P><B>neighborhood were alwasy asking if the house was haunted and one time
an old</B>
<P><B>woman I had never seen before asked me if I knew of the girl that had
been</B>
<P><B>locked in her room, in MY house, and she had died there.  There is
also</B>
<P><B>another story that happened in this same house.  My uncle was living
with</B>
<P><B>us.  He was 70 years old and I was about 10 at the time.  One night
I heard</B>
<P><B>him calling my father.  He was shouting and that is what woke me up.
 My</B>
<P><B>father went running into his room and this was my uncle's reply, "I
know</B>
<P><B>you're not going to believe this and I know I shouldn't be seeing this
but I</B>
<P><B>DO".  "There is a black woman standing in front of the fireplace holding
a</B>
<P><B>little girl's hand and she is waring a red coat and hat".  Then, my
father</B>
<P><B>said that my uncle's eyes followed  something around the room and then
my</B>
<P><B>uncle began to scream again, "No....go away....don't come near me"!!!!
 Then</B>
<P><B>they disappeared.  My father said he had never been so scared in his
life</B>
<P><B>because my uncle was being rational about it, like he knew he shouldn't
be</B>
<P><B>seeing something like that but he did.  I knew there was something
in that</B>
<P><B>house.  Although we moved out when I was 14 I still drive by to look
and I</B>
<P><B>still get a creepy feeling about it, just from driving by.  I feel
it in my</B>
<P><B>bones.  What do you think?  I would really appreciate your opinion.
 Thank</B>
<P><B>you so much!</B>

<P>
<P><B>My mom and one of my sisters just moved to New York and we are living
in the </B>
<P><B>house my mom grew up in. Both of her parents are dead and have been
for a </B>
<P><B>number of years. Ever since we have gotten here my mom and sister have
felt </B>
<P><B>something in the house. I can't feel anything but I can see something.
The </B>
<P><B>other day I watched my dead grandpa of 11 years walk into the room.
I ran </B>
<P><B>upstairs so fast once I was able to move and stayed there until my
sister </B>
<P><B>decied to come downstairs for bed. The next day we started talking
about </B>
<P><B>what happened. My sister said that once she got into bed and underneath
the </B>
<P><B>covers she felt something ontop of her giving her a hug and it hugged
her </B>
<P><B>until she fell asleep. My mom then joined in on the conversation and
said </B>
<P><B>that her parents still live in this house. She told us that she actually
sat </B>
<P><B>down the other day and talked with her father and then her mother joined
in </B>
<P><B>and told her to talk to someone in our church. She did that and found
out </B>
<P><B>that the person she was supposed to talk to was in charge on geneology
and </B>
<P><B>that they actually knew the same people from San Diego. This kinda
spooked </B>
<P><B>me out cause it took my mom a good few months to tell me this... She
always </B>
<P><B>tells me something I should know after I see a spirit.</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>Some More</B>
<P>
<P><B>By:    bzebe@hotmail.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>Many people see spirits in houses and such so they conclude the places
are </B>
<P><B>haunted. However I believe I am haunted. I have seen spirits my whole
life, </B>
<P><B>but some (when I was a child) I can't remember so my mother tells me.
The </B>
<P><B>one I am going to talk about now happened when I was about 1 year old.
I am </B>
<P><B>now 18.</B>
<P><B>We lived in a town just outside of San Diego, California. The people
that </B>
<P><B>lived in the house before us abused their children and locked them
in the </B>
<P><B>closets. My mom has found evidence of this but does not know to what
extent </B>
<P><B>these childeren were torchered.</B>
<P><B>My mom has had many experiences with the evil spirits that lived in
the </B>
<P><B>house. One day when I was finished playing with my blocks she went
in to </B>
<P><B>clean up after me. She knew exactly how many blocks there were and
found </B>
<P><B>that one was missing. She looked all over the room and even felt around
on </B>
<P><B>the bed and still couldn't find it. She then left the room to see if
I had </B>
<P><B>it with me which I didn't so she went back into the room and there
it was </B>
<P><B>just sitting on the edge of the bed where she had previously looked
and </B>
<P><B>felt. My mom always kept the house spic and span, she hated a messy
house. </B>
<P><B>She had just finished cleaning the living room when she left and came
back </B>
<P><B>in and found a hair brush in the middle of the floor. Noone had been
in the </B>
<P><B>bathroom or the living room since she cleaned them. The spirits knew
how to </B>
<P><B>maky my mom mad. They would always take things and put them way out
of place </B>
<P><B>so my mom was always running around putting them back into place just
to </B>
<P><B>find them out of place again. She was always cold in the house even
if she </B>
<P><B>was sitting by a roaring fire. She would always see little black figures
</B>
<P><B>running across the room and when she would look to see again they were
gone. </B>
<P><B>So finally my mom took my sisters and me out of the house and swore
she </B>
<P><B>would never go back in until my dad said a prayer to get rid of the
spirits. </B>
<P><B>So my dad was inside for a little bit and then came out and said that
he </B>
<P><B>said a prayer. My mom questioned him for a while and then he had her
</B>
<P><B>convinced. So my mom took all of us back in the house. She then turned
to my </B>
<P><B>dad and in a very stern voice said,"You didn't pray!" My dad of course
asked </B>
<P><B>her how she knew. She said,"I'm sitting in front of a fire and I'm
cold." </B>
<P><B>His face just fell. So my mom had all of us sit down and have a family
</B>
<P><B>prayer together. After that prayer to get rid of the spirits they have
never </B>
<P><B>come back. We then moved out of that house and I have been able to
see </B>
<P><B>spirits all the time. Every house I have either seen a spirit or have
felt </B>
<P><B>one watching me. This is still going on. Just three days ago I watched
my </B>
<P><B>grandfather walk into the room. He has been dead since I was 7 years
old.</B>
<P><B>If anyone knows what is going on with me please e-mail me.</B>

<P><B>Lady in the Window</B>
<P>
<P><B>By:   Lilsis3166@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B> When I was 7 yrs old my parents my sister and I lived in a home that
was a </B>
<P><B>one story house that sat way back from the street. My aunt used to
baby sit </B>
<P><B>us when my parents were away at work. Anytime I got into trouble my
aunt </B>
<P><B>would make me go into a little bedroom in the back of our house and
she</B>
<P><B>would </B>
<P><B>make me stay in there for hours at a time. I never knew why but, I
was </B>
<P><B>deathly afraid of that room and the whole time I was in there I would
hide </B>
<P><B>under the blankets too afraid to move until she came to let me out.
One day </B>
<P><B>while I was playing in the yard I found out why I was so afraid of
that </B>
<P><B>room...</B>
<P><B> While I was outside playing with my toys I suddenly got the feeling
that I </B>
<P><B>was being watched. I looked around me but I didn't see anybody. I went
back </B>
<P><B>to playing but I just couldn't shake that "watched" feeling. I turned
to</B>
<P><B>look </B>
<P><B>at the house to see if maybe my aunt or sister was around and  I saw
a woman </B>
<P><B>in the bathroom window watching me! I know it wasn't my aunt or sister
</B>
<P><B>because the both have very dark hair and the woman in the window had
very </B>
<P><B>light colored hair. I didn't know what to do, I was afraid to move!
I stayed </B>
<P><B>outside for the rest of the afternoon because I didn't want to go into
the </B>
<P><B>house. When my mom came home that day I finally went inside. I didn't
say </B>
<P><B>anything to my mom or anyone about what I had seen. I was worried that
they </B>
<P><B>wouldn't believe me. So, I kept quiet. My sister and I shared a bedroom
and </B>
<P><B>that night I woke up to the sounds of cupboards opening and closeing
like </B>
<P><B>someone was looking for something and I heard glasses being moved around
and </B>
<P><B>the water being turned off and on. Well, being a little kid, I figured
I was </B>
<P><B>just imagining it and as I lay there listening to this I looked over
at my </B>
<P><B>sister who was sleeping threw this hole thing. The next morning I asked
my </B>
<P><B>mom if she was up lastnight getting a drink and she said no. But she
looked </B>
<P><B>at me kinda funny. That night my mom had some friends over and she
sent my </B>
<P><B>sister and I to bed early. My sister fell right to sleep but I just
kept </B>
<P><B>thinking about what I had saw in the window and what I had heard the
night </B>
<P><B>before. My mom and her friends started talking about a lady who had
hung </B>
<P><B>herself in the back bedroom of our house! I could not believe what
I was </B>
<P><B>hearing! My mom then went on to tell her friends that she hears noises
in</B>
<P><B>the </B>
<P><B>kitchen at night.  The next day as I was playing in the yard I saw
the woman </B>
<P><B>in the bathroom window again. I started to cry and my aunt got mad
at me so </B>
<P><B>she tried to lock me in that back room again. I was kicking and screaming
</B>
<P><B>that I didn't want to go in there but she wouldn't listen to me. As
I sat on </B>
<P><B>the bed (under the covers) I heard the door swing open. I thought it
was my </B>
<P><B>aunt come to let me out so I uncoverd my head but nobody was there.
I then </B>
<P><B>started to hear a squeeking noise. Kinda like something heavy hanging
from a </B>
<P><B>wooden bar. It sounded like it was coming from the closet. The closet
was a </B>
<P><B>really big walk in one. There was no way I was going to look in there!
I</B>
<P><B>just </B>
<P><B>sat on the bed listening to this noise until my aunt came to get me.</B>
<P><B>  I later found out that the lady hung herself in the closet of that
back </B>
<P><B>room. I'm just wondering if anyone knows why she did this? And when
it took </B>
<P><B>place. </B>
<P><B>  Well, thats my story. And believe me, it is all completly true. </B>
<P>
<P><B>Late Night Burial</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: name withheld by request</B>
<P>
<P><B>Although this is a true tale, it's not one of your spine tinglers,
just</B>
<P><B>something odd that cannot be explained.  It was told to me several
years</B>
<P><B>ago by a colleague and happened to her mum (Jean) and some friends.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Although Jean lived in Romford (Essex), she regularly went to a
keep-fit</B>
<P><B>class a small school hall in Upminster.  The class had finished and
her and</B>
<P><B>her friends had piled into her car and drove round the corner, parking
near</B>
<P><B>the chip shop, and they all ordered fish and chips (like you do when
you've</B>
<P><B>just had a good workout!).  They were all sitting in the car quietly
eating</B>
<P><B>when one person noticed something odd, and nudged the person next to
them.</B>
<P><B>Eventually they were all mesmerized, mouths agape, chips forgotten
as their</B>
<P><B>attention was focused on the activities in the church yard over the
road.</B>
<P><B>Quite clearly they could see a silent night time funeral procession
of a</B>
<P><B>coffin being carried (on the shoulders) by six pallbearers, all decked
out</B>
<P><B>in long black tailed coats.  They silently watched the procession walk
from</B>
<P><B>one side of the church and disappear round to the other side (St
Mary's</B>
<P><B>Lane, for anyone who lives nearby). Of course, they all asked each
other</B>
<P><B>'did you see what I saw?', knowing full well they did.  The next day
Jean</B>
<P><B>decided to visit the church as she just HAD to know what had happened
 -</B>
<P><B>maybe someone was buried late last night.  However, she got to the
church</B>
<P><B>and found the vicar, she worded the question carefully so's not to
look</B>
<P><B>like a complete idiot and was absolutely stunned when the vicar told
her</B>
<P><B>that no funeral took place last night.  She said that from the look
on his</B>
<P><B>face it was fairly obvious that he knew why she was asking, but being
a</B>
<P><B>vicar he simply smiled and walked away.   Spooky!</B>
<P>
<P><B>I've been past the churchyard as my grandparents used to live just
down</B>
<P><B>the road, and it is quite a creepy looking place  -  all the stones
are</B>
<P><B>really old and crumbly and covered in moss, non of the names or dates
are</B>
<P><B>readable.  It's one of those graveyards when you can look at it for
a</B>
<P><B>little while and then you kind of shudder and have to look away.  I
used to</B>
<P><B>think it was my childish imagination, but even these days the place
still</B>
<P><B>gives me the creeps  -  even in the middle of summer!</B>

<P><B>My Story</B>
<P>
<P><B>By:  takeme2heaven@hotmail.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>Well like everyone else I'll start off with some background information.
I'm </B>
<P><B>19 right now and ever since I was young have had a fascination with
death </B>
<P><B>and what lies beyond. Every time I would read something I would try
to think </B>
<P><B>it I had a similar experience, but I didn't. I have lived in Chicago
for </B>
<P><B>most of my life in the same house. Nothing really special about it
expect </B>
<P><B>our basement floors are basically entirely dirt. But that doesn't really
</B>
<P><B>mean anything to my story...When my mom found out she was expecting
my third </B>
<P><B>brother she decided we needed to do a little remodeling and room </B>
<P><B>changing...so I ended up having my brother's old room (which also used
to be </B>
<P><B>my brother's room) Nothing unusual happened while I was living there
until </B>
<P><B>the end of my senior year in High School. I was asleep one night and
the </B>
<P><B>room got unbelievably cold, although no windows were open and it was
a warm </B>
<P><B>night. I burried myself under my blankets and tried to go ack to sleep.This
</B>
<P><B>would happen from time to time, then one night I was woken up again
by the </B>
<P><B>extreme cold when I saw a shadow of a man whose feature I could make
out </B>
<P><B>just watching me sleep. He stood about a foot away from my bed. When
he </B>
<P><B>noticed I was awake he just turned and walked out of my room but he
went </B>
<P><B>through the wall right next to my door. The first few times I saw him
I was </B>
<P><B>petrified and would just close my eyes tight til I felt the room warming
up. </B>
<P><B>There was also times when I would see him coming from the kitchen,
which was </B>
<P><B>outside my room, and walk back into my closet. Also at night I would
hear </B>
<P><B>things fall off my dresser and I would just calmly as I could ask him
to </B>
<P><B>pick them up and when I'd wake everything would be as I left it. I
never </B>
<P><B>told any of my friends or family about this because they are not </B>
<P><B>believers...til one day my mom had called me at school since I had
moved out </B>
<P><B>for college telling me my sister refuses to sleep or go into my room
any </B>
<P><B>more. That she woke up one night and came screaming into my parent's
bedroom </B>
<P><B>about a man who was watching her while she was in my room sleeping...I
</B>
<P><B>didn't say anything while my mom told me but I did interrupt her before
she </B>
<P><B>could give me the description of the man my sister gave...I told her
what I </B>
<P><B>had seen and my mom  dropped the phone.She kept asking how I knew,
so I </B>
<P><B>finally told her how I had seem him before. I also told her if the
lights </B>
<P><B>ever go out in my room to clamly ask the Man to turn them back off.
My mom </B>
<P><B>just laughed at me.Also I should mention since I moved out of the house
for </B>
<P><B>school my room remains hot to room temperature while I'm gone. But
when I </B>
<P><B>come home on weekends the temp does not go above 50 degrees no matter
how </B>
<P><B>high we set the heat or how many little heaters we put in there. Than
one </B>
<P><B>night my mom was clearing out some of my sister's clothes so I would
have </B>
<P><B>room for mine when I came home for the summer and my dad was sitting
outside </B>
<P><B>in the kitchen watching TV. It was relatively late at night and my
mom had </B>
<P><B>just finished clearing out a draw and was about to get up when the
lights </B>
<P><B>went out.My mom said out loud.."Look I'm almost done here and Jennifer
will </B>
<P><B>be home next week so please just put the lights on" and just as she
finished </B>
<P><B>the lights went on and my mom ran out of my room. Since I have been
home for </B>
<P><B>the summer my room is back stays at a normal temperature..which I'm
thankful </B>
<P><B>for but I still hear things in my closet and I will see a light shine
</B>
<P><B>through the closet doors although I don't have any lights in the
closet.</B>

<P><B>My Life with Ghosts</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: hschwart@unix1.ccac.edu</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>I'll try to keep this as short as possible. Everything I've written
here</B>
<P><B>is true. It wasn't until around the age of twelve that I was sure
that</B>
<P><B>not everyone can see ghosts.  I guess that I had just assumed that</B>
<P><B>everybody else could see what I could see. My first experience that
I</B>
<P><B>can recall was around the age of six.  I remember waking up from a
bad</B>
<P><B>dream, don't remember any details, and there was a man standing in
the</B>
<P><B>doorway of my room telling me that everything was ok, go back to sleep.
</B>
<P><B>I saw a picture of this man in a family photo album about two years</B>
<P><B>later.  It was my grandfather who had passed away when I was two
years</B>
<P><B>old. This is only time I can recall hearing a ghost.  The next</B>
<P><B>occurrence that I can recall was around the age of eight.  My parents</B>
<P><B>and two of my three brothers and I were in the family car.  We had</B>
<P><B>stopped to get ice-cream at the local ice cream shop.  Directly
across</B>
<P><B>the street and slightly uphill was a funeral home.  I was looking out</B>
<P><B>the back window of the car and asked my brother why the lady walking</B>
<P><B>across the yard could only be seen from the waist up.  He informed
me</B>
<P><B>that I was crazy, there was no one there, even though I could still
see</B>
<P><B>her.  The next ten years are sort of fuzzy, I can't actually recall</B>
<P><B>"seeing" anything out of the ordinary but I do remember knowing
things</B>
<P><B>before they happened, especially meeting new people who had appeared
in</B>
<P><B>a dream a night or two before actually meeting these people.  I went
to</B>
<P><B>college at the age of seventeen.  Two occurrences happened during
this</B>
<P><B>year (1972).  I met a group of people who were into seances.  Only
two</B>
<P><B>occurrences happened because I only met with these people twice.  The</B>
<P><B>first thing that happened was when a group of us, about fifteen
people,</B>
<P><B>held a seance in one of the groups dorm room. Midway through the
seance</B>
<P><B>a bright red light about the size of a quarter appeared in the middle
of</B>
<P><B>one of the walls.  One of the girls jumped up, breaking the circle
of</B>
<P><B>hands and the light disappeared.  About a week after this three
people</B>
<P><B>from this group and myself decided to hold another seance in a
different</B>
<P><B>room.  The girl who led the seance had a scroll that she read from
(I</B>
<P><B>don't know where this came from).  The scroll required the lighting
of</B>
<P><B>candles, one red and one white, lit at different times about five</B>
<P><B>minutes apart.  The white candle was lit first, then the red one and</B>
<P><B>were set about four feet away from each other.  Within ten seconds
of</B>
<P><B>the lighting of the red candle one of the girls screamed that
something</B>
<P><B>had touched her, she jumped up turning on the lights.  Both candles
had</B>
<P><B>been knocked over and blown out.  The part that still gives me a
nervous</B>
<P><B>feeling is that white wax was spilled from the red candle and red wax</B>
<P><B>was spilled from the white candle.  I slept with a bible and a cross</B>
<P><B>that night and have never and will never be involved with another
seance</B>
<P><B>again.  In the early 1980's I was married and my wife and I were
looking</B>
<P><B>at some property in Somerset, PA.  There was five acres of ground,
a</B>
<P><B>small store with housing on the second floor and a large pond.  The
real</B>
<P><B>estate agent showing us the pond was a little taken back when I asked</B>
<P><B>her how long ago the lady was drowned.  She asked how I knew this.
 I</B>
<P><B>informed her that I could see a lady standing near the edge of the
pond,</B>
<P><B>the lady was dripping wet and she was looking at me holding her hands</B>
<P><B>out which I thought meant she was asking for help.  The agent said
a</B>
<P><B>woman had committed suicide in that pond the year before.  I told the</B>
<P><B>real estate lady that I didn't get the impression about suicide, I
think</B>
<P><B>the lady had help drowning.  The ghost then disappeared.  We didn't
buy</B>
<P><B>the place.  About three years after this I was living Virginia in a
farm</B>
<P><B>house that was about two hundred years old.  Down the street about
two</B>
<P><B>blocks was a small funeral home.  One night a friend and I were
sitting</B>
<P><B>on the porch of this house when I waved a greeting in the air.  My</B>
<P><B>friend turned around then asked who I was waving to.  I said you
can't</B>
<P><B>see the elderly gentleman standing on the steps to the funeral home
can</B>
<P><B>you.  He replied no, there is no one there.  I informed him that not</B>
<P><B>only was there someone there, but the man had waved to me first and
I</B>
<P><B>thought it only polite to wave back.  It is now 1999, I am remarried
and</B>
<P><B>have two wonderful little girls.  The house we are living in now is
in</B>
<P><B>PA.  When the oldest was two, she kept waking up at night yelling
Daddy</B>
<P><B>I need you, I'm scared.  I finally was able to ascertain that ghosts</B>
<P><B>were waking her up at night.  I told the ghosts (who were the
previous</B>
<P><B>owners, and his mother) that they were welcome to stay, this was
there</B>
<P><B>home, provided they did not scare the children.  They come and go
now,</B>
<P><B>and never do anything to scare my girls.  There were two other
ghosts,</B>
<P><B>both Indians from I think the 1700's.  One has never returned, the
other</B>
<P><B>stays out of doors occasionally telling me where to dig to find arrow</B>
<P><B>heads.  I am trying to teach my daughters not to fear ghosts, ghosts</B>
<P><B>don't have control over you, but you can control whether they are</B>
<P><B>permitted to visit or not.</B>
<P><B>P.S.:  Three months ago my two year old was in the basement with my</B>
<P><B>wife.  She was screaming that she couldn't walk over to where my wife</B>
<P><B>was because she was scared of the "man".  It was hard to get an
accurate</B>
<P><B>description of the man because of her age but I'm pretty sure it was
the</B>
<P><B>former occupant of the house.</B>

<P><B>A Story</B>
<P>
<P><B>By:  Kellerfyre@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>        I have several stories of isolated events, though today I will
only </B>
<P><B>share one with you. Feel free to use it on your page, though I don't
know if </B>
<P><B>it qualifies as a "haunting".</B>
<P><B>        The high school I graduated from has a rich history. It's an
all </B>
<P><B>girls private Catholic college prepatory school named Ursuline
Academy,</B>
<P><B>found in Dallas, Texas. The institution is 125 years old this year
(I was a part</B>
<P><B>of the 125th class to graduate from UA) though it hasn't always rested
on it's </B>
<P><B>spot on Walnut Hill Lane. </B>
<P><B>       Back in the 1800 and 1900's, the school was still taught by
nuns</B>
<P><B>who, like the students, actually resided on campus. The sisters slept
on the</B>
<P><B>upper level of Brescia Hall; that is why their rooms, which over look
the</B>
<P><B>courtyard underclassmen are allowed into, are so small and why teaching
in them can be </B>
<P><B>cramped at times. The hallway on both levels of Brescia Hall look into
the </B>
<P><B>Senior Courtyard.</B>
<P><B>        One nun was very fond of one particular class of the 1900's.
Her </B>
<P><B>health failed as the class moved up through the grades, which included
</B>
<P><B>kindergarden and grade school levels at the time, but she promised
she </B>
<P><B>wouldn't miss their senior class picture. She died in her room in Upper
</B>
<P><B>Brescia before the picture was taken. She intended to keep her word
though, </B>
<P><B>and on the day the dozen or so girls arranged themselves in Senior</B>
<P><B>Courtyard, her spirit appeared in a window of Upper Brescia, unbeknownst
to the girls. </B>
<P><B>It was only later when the picture was developed that her clear appearance
</B>
<P><B>was discovered. It now hangs in Main Hall, along with the other class
</B>
<P><B>pictures, with the addendum "***Note the nun in the window."</B>
<P><B>        Now for my personal story. I was a junior helping with the</B>
<P><B>sophomores at Planned Famine with a few of my classmates. Since we
were helping, we</B>
<P><B>were to stay in the chapel, which was cozy and made us feel comfortable
since it </B>
<P><B>was a holy place in our big dark school, instead of the cafeteria known
</B>
<P><B>simply as Haggar. The heat in there seemed to be working overtime though
and </B>
<P><B>a few of the other girls couldn't take it. We all moved our belongings
to </B>
<P><B>Room 21, at the far end of Brescia Hall, shivering as a blast of cold
air</B>
<P><B>hit us every time we crossed the official threshold (that happened
to me every </B>
<P><B>time I walked through, no matter the time or if I was alone, giving
me an </B>
<P><B>uneasy feeling. It didn't happen during school, though). </B>
<P><B>        Later that night, after a round of singing in the chapel, I
crept </B>
<P><B>into my makeshift bed and quickly fell asleep, only to wake up around
3:22</B>
<P><B>am freezing. As I turned over, I heard women singing. I thought it
strange that </B>
<P><B>my fellow singers were still up and singing so loudly that I could
hear them </B>
<P><B>from the chapel, but they were in bed next to me. I could see their
heads on </B>
<P><B>their pillows on the floor. Freaked out, I stiffly returned to bed,
sleeping </B>
<P><B>lightly for the rest of the night. </B>
<P><B>        The next day, I relate the story to the campus minister, Mrs.
</B>
<P><B>Ray-Grady, who casually told me I heard the dead nuns singing their
songs </B>
<P><B>before they headed off to bed..... no more sleeping in school for me!</B>

<P><B>Saint Michaels</B>
<P>
<P><B>By:  jreagan6@excite.com</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>Thanks for posting my description of St. Michael's college on your
haunted</B>
<P><B>places page.  I love reading all the stories and finally decided to</B>
<P><B>contribute a couple myself, to go along with the haunted location I
gave to</B>
<P><B>you.</B>
<P><B>I was a Staff Assistant in my sophomore year at St. Michael's.  What
this</B>
<P><B>meant was basically I watched the doors coming into one of the dorms
to make</B>
<P><B>sure that the only people coming in were the residents.  I sat at a
desk</B>
<P><B>from 11pm-4am a couple of nights a week.  One night, I was making the
rounds</B>
<P><B>from floor to floor to make sure all was relatively quiet.  I got to
the top</B>
<P><B>floor of the building and that is, of course, when the proverbial
strange</B>
<P><B>things started to happen.  I began walking down the hall and I heard
the</B>
<P><B>wind howling through the recycling room on the floor.  It had been
a quiet</B>
<P><B>night weather-wise, so this was a little odd.  I passed it off as random
New</B>
<P><B>England weather patterns and continued to walk on.  When I stepped
in front</B>
<P><B>of the first resident's door, it started to rattle like someone was
going to</B>
<P><B>come out.  I stopped and waited, but the door just kept rattling so
I moved</B>
<P><B>on.  Then the next door on the other side of the hall started to rattle
as I</B>
<P><B>passed in front it, and then another door started.  Now there were
three</B>
<P><B>doors all rattling away, and it had only started when I walked in front
of</B>
<P><B>them.  They hadn't done this earlier in the evening, and I was wide
awake so</B>
<P><B>it wasn't my imagination.  What really startled me was all of a sudden,
in</B>
<P><B>the midst of all this door action, I had a feeling that someone was
right</B>
<P><B>behind me.  I turned to look and no one was there, but the doors kept
on</B>
<P><B>shaking and the wind was screaming, so I ran the rest of the way down
the</B>
<P><B>hall and back downstairs to my desk.  A check of the outside revealed
that</B>
<P><B>the weather was perfectly calm. I believe this is the oldest dorm on
campus,</B>
<P><B>so who knows what other-wordly beings reside there? </B>
<P><B>The other thing that happened to me while I was there was sort of a
strange</B>
<P><B>religious experience, and I am probably one of the last people
something</B>
<P><B>like this should happen to :)  I was driving home from my
then-boyfriend's</B>
<P><B>(now my husband) house and heading back to my dorm at St. Mike's. 
I was at</B>
<P><B>a stop light, alone in the car, when I heard this deep male voice tell
me</B>
<P><B>that the second coming was going to happen soon.  The voice filled
me with a</B>
<P><B>very warm, happy sense of peace.  The light turned green and I drove
off.</B>
<P><B>About two minutes later I started to think about what just happened
and got</B>
<P><B>very scared.  I talked to one of the priests at school the next day,
and he</B>
<P><B>felt this was a "normal" experience within the realm of St.
Michael's,</B>
<P><B>partially because it was getting near Christmastime, and partially
because</B>
<P><B>he felt the campus was a center for both good and evil, the good being
the</B>
<P><B>chapel on campus, and the bad being the portal that was never shut
in the</B>
<P><B>boys' dormatory.  He confirmed the story about the pentagram in my
location</B>
<P><B>descrition without me even bringing it up!  I have heard this "godly"
voice</B>
<P><B>once or twice since the original incident but not to the degree that
I heard</B>
<P><B>that night.</B>
<P><B>Sorry this was so long!  I have a few more stories but I'll save them
for</B>
<P><B>later...</B>

<P><B>True to life</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: KarenH38@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>20 years ago when we moved into  our house (a duplex).  We were good
friends </B>
<P><B>with the  tenant and she had told us that she was going to be gone
for the </B>
<P><B>weekend.  So we were home (sleeping on a sofa sleeper in the living
room at </B>
<P><B>the time) and we heard noised from upstairs, sounding as if someone
was </B>
<P><B>dragging furniture across the floor, my husband went to the stairs
and</B>
<P><B>yelled </B>
<P><B>up to see if anyone was there and the apartment was dark.  So he came
back </B>
<P><B>downstairs and we fell asleep not thinking anything more about it.
 Well,</B>
<P><B>the </B>
<P><B>next day when she came home, she came downstairs and asked us if there
had </B>
<P><B>been a problem upstairs, and we said not why and she said, that she
was just </B>
<P><B>wondering why we moved all of her dinning room chairs into the kitchen.
 At </B>
<P><B>first I was scared but then for years nothing had happened.  Until
Jenny was </B>
<P><B>born,  One night,  my husband was gone hunting and I was awoken by
the noise </B>
<P><B>of her mobile being turned on.  I went into her room and she was lying
there </B>
<P><B>awake, watching the mobile move above her.  Then then the last time
that </B>
<P><B>anything had happened was about 3 years ago,  My husband and I had
divorced </B>
<P><B>and I was seeing someone,  well, my friend as I call it, must not of
liked </B>
<P><B>him,  because he had always kept his cologne on the dresser and at
least</B>
<P><B>once </B>
<P><B>or twice a week I would come home and find it either knocked over,
on the </B>
<P><B>floor, in the garbage,  at first we blamed the cat, but then, we started
</B>
<P><B>closing the bedroom door and it still would happen, of course he never
</B>
<P><B>believed, nobody ever does, but I doo!  Never the less, I am not with
him </B>
<P><B>anymore but I am remarried since and have had no problems.  Sometimes
when</B>
<P><B>Im </B>
<P><B>alone, I do feel that there is someone or something there with me and
my </B>
<P><B>daughter.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>I sure that you recieve thousands of these stories, but mine is true
and </B>
<P><B>whether you or anyone else believe my, I know in my heart that it is
true.</B>
