<p><b>Time Tunnel</b><b></b>

</p><p><b>By: mhouse4@earthlink.net</b><b></b>

</p><p><b>This summer my husband and children and myself went on vacation in
Tennessee with my husbands brother and his family.&nbsp; We stayed in Pigeon
Forge and one day went into Gatlinburg.&nbsp; On the way there we went
through a short tunnel.&nbsp; My sister-in-law later remarked she remembered
that as soon as you entered you could see day light out the other side.&nbsp;
There was not even time for a good horn honk, we were through so quick!&nbsp;
Later when we got to our cabin and started talking about our drive and
the scenery and such none of us could remember going through a tunnel on
the way home.&nbsp; We chalked it up to being distracted by kids and conversation
and never really thought about it anymore.&nbsp; A couple days later we
went back through Gatlinburg to go up into the Great Smokey Mountains Nat'l
Park.&nbsp; This time we went through a long tunnel.&nbsp; One that curved
around before you could see the other side and also it was dark and had
lights above us.&nbsp; We went the same route as before and this time we
took note!&nbsp; We did not come out of the park until nightfall.&nbsp;
On the way out we told ghost stories.&nbsp; When I got through telling
one of my old family stories, all at once my sister-in-laws cell phone
lights came on and the walkie talkies we had with us to keep in contact
with each other when we would split up, started ringing!&nbsp; This lasted
for just a few seconds and quit, but wow, what a chill it gave us!&nbsp;
Also we did not go through any tunnel on the way back!&nbsp;&nbsp; Last
day of vacation my sister-in-law and myself went shopping and went back
through Gatlinburg.&nbsp; This time we went through a short tunnel and
coming back we went through a long tunnel.&nbsp; TWO tunnels!&nbsp; We
thought we were losing our minds.&nbsp; We were truly perplexed!&nbsp;
Later that evening we went on a "Ghost Walk" with a local folk lorest who
after a bit, told us stories of folks who sometimes go through tunnels
traveling that route and sometimes don't.&nbsp; It is a mystery she said
and one of the theories is that of a dimension of time that waivers in
and out, putting the tunnels there at times and other times not.&nbsp;
Sometimes there is one and sometimes two, sometimes short and sometimes
long!&nbsp;&nbsp; We couldn't believe our ears!&nbsp; It happened to us
and we never said a word about it to her and here she was telling us exactly
what we had experienced.&nbsp; Now I don't know what the truth to the matter
really is but it sure spooked me!</b><b></b>

<p><b>Sensitivity</b><b></b>

</p><p><b>By: TDreamer26@aol.com</b><b></b>

</p><p><b>My name is Tracy.&nbsp; I'm not sure that I have a problem with a
haunting, but would just like to share my story.....</b>
<br><b>It starts back to when I was a young child.&nbsp; My mother and
I always had this psychic connection.&nbsp; For instance, I never had to
tell my Mom what I wanted for lunch.&nbsp; She would just think of a few
choices and I would then walk in seconds later and give her the answer
to the question that she never asked.&nbsp; Now if this happened just a
few times, I would have washed it off to coincidence, but this happened
all the time.&nbsp; Now, as an adult, I get to do this with my children.&nbsp;
It's pretty neat.&nbsp; I always had this psychic capability -- not asking
for it, or concentrating on it -- it just happens.&nbsp; Well, now with
a little background on me, I'll get to the good stuff.</b>
<br><b>When I was about 5 years old, my parents purchased our first house
from an older woman who's husband had passed away and she was moving to
Florida, hence the reason she asked us to keep her cat.&nbsp; From the
moment I stepped into the house, I felt watched.&nbsp; This feeling only
increased with time.&nbsp; So bad that I used to get dressed under the
covers.&nbsp; I remember it happening in my bedroom more than any other
room.&nbsp; I didn't feel that way in the bathroom after I took a bath
or something, it just seemed to be in my bedroom.&nbsp; Then the nightmares
started.&nbsp; I would wake up extremely distraught, usually having the
same few nightmares over and over again.&nbsp; I was terrified of under
my bed so I used to jump from my bed out of my doorway and run to my parents
room on the other end of the house.&nbsp; I would then go to sleep on the
floor by their bed.&nbsp; I was never afraid of under their bed.&nbsp;
I didn't realize how strange that was until I got older.&nbsp; As I would
run to their room on many occassions I would look behind me and I swear
I would see something chasing me.&nbsp; Now, I guess I left this to an
overactive childhood imagination, but I found out more.</b>
<br><b>When I got older my mother told me that she used to hear voices
in the attic, but upon going up there (with a knife in hand), there would
never be anyone up there.&nbsp; There was never anyone outside either.&nbsp;
She said that she always felt the presence of an older man.</b>
<br><b>When I was 14, my parents divorced and I rebeled and in short my
father got custody of us and we got the house.&nbsp; My Dad is very carpenter
handy so he decided to rebuild the house and increase it's size.&nbsp;
Not too long after the "remodeling" of the house, me &amp; my brother were
sitting on my Dad's bed with the door shut and all of a sudden the door
handle started to jiggle so my brother jumped up and grabbed the handle
as it was jiggling and threw the door open and nothing.&nbsp; There was
no one else in the house, but my brother immediately ran down the hallway
to the front door and looked outside to make sure.&nbsp; It's impossible
that someone was there.&nbsp; The only original things left on the house
are the original foundation and the chimney.&nbsp; I figured after the
remodeling was done whatever was here, left -- until recently.</b>
<br><b>About 2 years ago me, my fiancee, my 2 children and my brother all
took the house over.&nbsp; One night me &amp; my fiancee were in bed sleeping
for about 30 minutes or so and I woke up and saw a dark shadow leaning
over his chest.&nbsp; I yelled, "stop" and then went right back to sleep.&nbsp;
The next morning, I didn't even think of it, til my fiancee called me from
work.&nbsp; He asked me why I yelled Stop and I told him that I didn't
know why, that I even forgot about it.&nbsp; Then I told him that I did
see a shadow that resembled a short, bald, heavyset man leaning over his
chest.&nbsp; He then told me that he woke up gasping for air and that the
dark shadow was pushing on his chest and pulling him off the bed.&nbsp;
Then when I yelled Stop -- it vanished.&nbsp; My fiancee is not a weak
man at all, he's very strong, so I knew something was going on.&nbsp; I
felt a presence in the room for a few weeks after that, but I went into
each of the rooms before bedtime and told him that he was not allowed in
there.</b>
<br><b>Then one night me &amp; my brother were on the couch talking and
I told him the story and he was in disbelief, of course.&nbsp; We then
both dozed off and I got woken up to a pale faced brother who said that
he got punched in the chest and he was having a hard time breathing.&nbsp;
I then did the same thing as before and have had nothing happen since.</b>

<br><b>Regarding the Stranger</b><b></b>

<p><b>By: Humanzee1@aol.com</b><b></b>

</p><p><b>Well this experience takes place almost 30yrs ago it was on a cold
February morning in those days&nbsp; i would be up at 4:30 in the morning
to get my husband ready for work I remember making him a fresh pot of coffee
along with his breakfast and packing him a lunch for the day he would leave
the house for work at 5:30 after he would leave I would go back to bed
but on this day I decided to lay on the couch in the living room cause
I had to be up again to get the kids ready for school</b>
<br><b>As I was laying on the couch in the living room in the dark I suddenly
heard the front door open I jumped to my feet thinking my husband returned
maybe he was coming back for something he forgot as I approched the door
a man a tall man walked into the house I was freightened i backed away
I froze was he going to rob us I shouted at him to leave but he just ignored
me and walked past me as if I was not there he was heading toward the kids
bedroom I immediately ran after him and just like that he disappeared I
awoke the kids and</b>
<br><b>ran to my neighbors house we called the police who came and went
throughout the house to make sure he was not hiding they found no one</b>
<br><b>I was confused no doubt because I did see this strange man walk
into the house he was somewhat odd looking I described him to the police
as a tall man with a mustachioed he was not wearing a coat and found it
odd because it was the dead of winter and he would be cold the police were
polite and courteous told me to reinforce the doors with security locks
and left feeling a little like I was loosing my mind I did not just dismiss
it that night when my husband came home from work I told him what happened
and he too was worried and the next day had dead bolts put in needles to
say I never experienced this again</b>
<br><b>A few months later I was preparing a potato salad for a picnic when
my elderly neighbor called me to come over her house and change a lite
bulb for her in her bathroom I noticed that she had pictures some looked
real old spread out on her kitchen table I sat down and</b>
<br><b>started to look through a few of the pictures then I came across
this picture of two men one short and stocky wearing a bowler hat the other
a tall light haired gentleman with a handle bar mustachio I recognized
the mustachioed man immediately as the man I saw walk into my house.</b>
<br><b>I asked my neighbor Phyllis who the men in the picture were and
she told me that it was her father and a friend of his I told her that
the man next to her father looked exactly like the man who walked into
my house, she gave me a strange look and said "Honey he has been dead for
over 40yrs but he used to live in your house he was a barber and he used
one of the back bedrooms as his shop" the same room my kids shared. Could
this have been the spirit of the man in the picture I do not know.</b><b></b>

<p><b>My Experiences with SPirits</b><b></b>

</p><p><b>By: bcitcwa@iinet.net.au</b><b></b>

</p><p><b>my name is imogen and i recently had an expeirience with the spirit
world.</b>
<br><b>it all started when i was checking out your website and listening
to the (evp) page. as soon as i turned on the message intitled "papsie'
i got a weird feeling in my stomach. i was starting to get a little freaked
out so i closed the page and started talking to my friend kathryn. in the
middle of our conversation i heard the same voice say "papsie" again i
thought it was all in my head but started to get a bit scared so i told
kathryn about it. suddenly on the computer screen next to me i saw a reflection
of someone i'd never seen before. It was a little girl. i figured i was
freaking myself out again ut it remained on the screen. then i heard the
girls voice again "papsie" she said louder this time. kathryn and i are
very interested in ghost and spirits and when i told her about the face
she said it had happened to her once before. 10 minutes later the face
was still staring at me the girl hadnt moved&nbsp; her head but while i
was not loking at her she stamped her feet and my water bottle shook. i
went to go to the toilet and when i got back the water bottle had been
moved and the face was nolonger in the computer screen but in its place
floating around the room was a small golden orb of light. Witchcraft being
a passion of mine i had read about&nbsp; these orbs and how some symbolised
the presence of an angel or spirit in the room. slowly the orb faded and
had soon vanished from sight.</b>
<br><b>i never got to make contact with the spirit and took no pictures
of it.&nbsp; when the orb had gone i felt empty and tired as though the
little girl had been a part of me and when she left our side of the earth
she took a part of me with her. every now and then i still hear her voice
in my head and feel slightly empty but also feell thet someone is always
watching over us. that is the third expeirience with spirits i have had
in the last two years.</b><b></b>

<br><b>MN Farmhouse</b><b></b>

<p><b>By: beautifullychaotic26@yahoo.com</b><b></b>

</p><p><b>Today is Sept. 17th,2003 a few days ago a co-worker rented a farmhouse
in MN. The last two days she has come to work and shared these stories
with me. Her husband and her both hear a baby crying, noise in the kitchen,
someone walking upstairs. She spent the night some place else and her husband
had someone lift up the covers and crawl in bed with him.I have given her
some Catholic blessed metals. She confronted the owner of the house and
told her.At first the woman downplayed it. Now she says the last renter
died in the house, an older woman (relative) had prefomed salt abortions.
And her son stayed in the house this summer, had not only these things
happen to him, but his bed furniture was moved. they've called a priest
to come next week.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Little person</b><b></b>

</p><p><b>By: CookieCrumbDMC@aol.com</b><b></b>

</p><p><b>A couple months ago I sent a story in about one of my experinces..here
is another one...This happened about month ago..you see I have a 2 year
old daughter and when she is napping I come online...Well one day I was
sitting here reading something on a website or it could have been this
one...when I saw a dark flash out the corner of my eye...thinking it was
my daughter up from her nap I started to say Hi to her but was surprised
that she wasn't there..this happened about three times than one day my
niece and I were looking at some ghost websites and my daughter woke up
and I was in the living room changing her when my niece came in the room
really pale and she just sat there for a moment and said "What's wrong?"
and she said "Umm..I think I saw something which I thought it was the baby...but
she is right here with you," and I said "Was it like a black streak like
the color of the baby's hair" and she said "Yes." and I said "I saw it
too." and she looked relieved..I haven't seen it in awhile so I don't know
if it here still or what but I do know about two weeks ago I was on my
parent's computer checking my e-mail on their account when the computer
turned off and than rebooted by it's self....my daugther was sleeping on
their bed and they were at the store...I thought to myself please don't
this when I'm alone not tonight than it worked fine from there....hope

<br><b>Ghost "Stories"</b><b></b>

<p><b>By: kpaetz@speedmail.ca</b><b></b>

</p><p><b>For as long as I can remember I have been able to see and feel the
paranormal.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t know what it was at first and was truly terrified
by the feelings I would get when &#8220;someone&#8221; came near me.&nbsp; I am at
the point where I am no longer so afraid but I do have my moments when
something sneaks up on me.&nbsp; Almost every home I have ever lived in
has been haunted and I am not sure now if they were the homes themselves
or I am being followed.&nbsp; I feel comfort in my newest home &amp; I
am almost sure that there is nothing here.&nbsp; Which I am grateful for
because my son senses them too and I am not sure if he can still see them
but he used to be able to.&nbsp; He knows his Uncle and Grandfather and
they both died before he was born.&nbsp; He knew things about them that
no one else told him and as a baby he would stare past me and start laughing
at air.&nbsp; In time he was able to communicate that he saw people and
the truly significant moment came 2 days before his Papa passed away.</b>
<br><b>He went into the room his Great-Grandfather was resting in and came
out and told me that there was a man in the chair and he was there to take
Papa &#8220;home.&#8221; My son was 2 at the time and we did not discuss his Great-Grandfather&#8217;s
dying to him.&nbsp; We only told him that he wasn&#8217;t feeling well.&nbsp;
I knew for sure then that he was able to see and sense things as well.</b>
<br><b>I have seen my brother-in-law praying beside his parents&#8217; bed a
few days after he died in a snowmobiling accident.&nbsp; He has made a
clock in his Grandparents home run when it has no batteries and hasn&#8217;t
worked in many years.&nbsp; Every time someone truly missed him and wanted
know if he was there, they would ask him to make the clock go and most
times it did.</b>
<br><b>I knew in my gut the instant my own Father died.&nbsp; No one had
to tell me.&nbsp; I had a very uneasy feeling in my stomach the night before
he died and I knew that I needed to go to him but this feeling stopped
me from getting on the plane to go home.&nbsp; The next morning, I knew
the instant he died and I was at my sister&#8217;s house.&nbsp; The feeling just
vanished and I knew.&nbsp; I told my sister that I had to go home and that
our Dad just died to which she pretty much told me that I was crazy but
I insisted and I drove myself home.</b>
<br><b>I don&#8217;t know how I got home; I don&#8217;t really remember the drive.&nbsp;
I remember getting into my car and this calm was over me and I remember
pulling into my driveway and my Mother-In-Law was standing there waiting
for me.&nbsp; I got out and told her that I thought my Dad died, she confirmed
it and that is when I lost it.&nbsp; I was 5 months pregnant with my son
at the time and I believe that somehow I was being pushed to stay home
because I am sure that I would have lost my son if I was with my Dad when
he died.&nbsp; The stress alone nearly killed me.</b>
<br><b>My Dad used to come to visit me.&nbsp; He would turn the lights
on and off to let me know that he was there.&nbsp; I could feel him around
me.&nbsp; It has been awhile since I have felt him but I know he&#8217;s still
around.</b>
<br><b>A duplex I lived in had 2 spirits.&nbsp; A man (not good) and a
woman.&nbsp; The woman would unlock doors in the night and turn lights
on.&nbsp; The man did not want us there and I sensed that especially in
the basement.&nbsp; A few people saw and felt both but the woman kept him
in check.&nbsp; The only time they really made themselves known while anyone
was awake was a night that my cousin and I were looking on the Internet
at pictures of ghosts and demons.&nbsp; All of a sudden there was a loud
crash from upstairs.&nbsp; We raced upstairs but NOTHING was out of place.&nbsp;
I got a really bad feeling and ran upstairs to my son&#8217;s room and grabbed
him.&nbsp; My husband wasn&#8217;t home but I called him to come home.&nbsp;
My cousin and I sat in my livingroom freaking out when I saw the man walk
by me and he was in black with a large brimmed hat.&nbsp; My cousin saw
him too and he had never previously had an encounter.&nbsp; It was as if
he was telling us to stay off those websites because they were not good
or something.&nbsp; All I remember was the absolute terror in my heart.</b>
<br><b>The orchard I grew up on was haunted by more than 3 spirits.&nbsp;
Not all of them were good and they made it known that we were not wanted
either.&nbsp; 1 spirit had befriended our family and would try to protect
us from the little girl who wanted us out of there very badly.&nbsp; I
believe that she and the little boy were my 2nd cousins killed in a car
accident with my Great-Grandfather though no one has been able to confirm
that.</b>
<br><b>Walking down the stairs to the basement, the same step always seemed
to break and you would trip.&nbsp; It never actually broke but 7 out of
10 times, you would trip on that damn stair.&nbsp; I mean anyone would
trip too.&nbsp; Faces would appear in windows, gunshots would ring out
behind our house and no one was there.&nbsp; My Dad checked for footprints
a few times because the shots were that close.</b>
<br><b>The taps in the kitchen exploded once and there were the booming
noises from within the house for no reason.&nbsp; I saw the spirit of the
cat my Dad ran over a few times and then there were the horses and cows
that periodically freaked out over something no one else could see.&nbsp;
There was also the drifting odor over the orchard of a dead animal though
it was never in one spot and there were no dead animals.</b>
<br><b>I used to feel like there was something under the stairs to the
basement.&nbsp; It was an old house with old wooden stairs, the kind that
had no back and under the stairs was dirt.&nbsp; I always had a bad feeling
about that and would fly down the stairs as fast as I could and run up
them 2 or 3 at a time.&nbsp; My Dad had renovated the house and my brother
and I were fortunate to have bedrooms in the basement.&nbsp; I got locked
into my room one night and we ended up having to take the hinges off to
get me out (no lock on the door).&nbsp; And when we were moving, I was
sitting on the floor in my room packing when all of a sudden the mirror
on my dresser came crashing down.&nbsp; Shards of glass missing me by centimeters.</b>
<br><b>My friend&#8217;s family rented the house from my Dad for a short period
of time and one night my friend had fallen asleep in the area in the basement
by the stairs, the hissing cat woke her up and she looked to see something
clawing out of the dirt.&nbsp; She didn&#8217;t stick around to find out what
it was.&nbsp; A few days later her brother came bolting into the room she
was sleeping in (my old bedroom) and grabbed her arm and demanded to know
if she was practicing witchcraft or something (she didn&#8217;t) because he had
2 perfect bite marks on his wrist and when they looked at her arm, she
had the exact same marks as if they had been bitten by fangs or something.&nbsp;
Needless to say they left shortly after but not because of the things they
experienced.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t find out about any of this until after they
moved.</b>
<br><b>An older woman bought the orchard and when my sister went back to
visit a year or so ago she happened to mention strange things that were
happening around the orchard and asked my sister if she knew anything about
it.&nbsp; My sister quickly filled her in about the yellow and green orbs
seen floating around the house, the strange occurrences and all the noises
etc.&nbsp; The difference of what she has seen and felt was that she saw
a cowboy and we were told there was an Indian on the orchard protecting
our family.&nbsp; Apparently the land that my Great-Grandparents had settled
on was once a battlefield and our family had been told the Indian Warrior
died in battle there.</b>
<br><b>The house we moved into after we moved off the orchard had its own
spirit or two as well.&nbsp; My parents didn&#8217;t believe me until a few years
after I moved out and my Mom had been home alone and the front door unlocked,
opened, closed, locked and she heard footsteps move around the house and
up the stairs and then they stopped.&nbsp; She also heard the kitchen cupboards
open and close and kept calling out to my Dad (they lived alone by this
time) but no answer.&nbsp; This continued like this for about &frac12;
an hour.&nbsp; My Mom got scared and refused to leave her bedroom until
my Dad actually came home an hour after that.&nbsp; She blamed him but
it couldn&#8217;t have been him, he was at work.&nbsp; This was a frequent occurrence
but previously my parents blamed my brother or myself or the other until
my brother and I moved out.</b>
<br><b>There was also the time my friend and I thought we would play a
trick on my brother and pretend that the house had been broken into.&nbsp;
We trashed the house (nicely) placing objects around as if they had been
thrown or scattered in a rush.&nbsp; We were standing in the kitchen laughing
about this when all of a sudden a hand reached up the window (you would
have to be almost 7 &frac12; feet tall to do this).&nbsp; We screamed and
ran up the stairs to get the cordless phone.&nbsp; The doorbell started
ringing and knocking on all of the windows started.&nbsp; We called the
police thinking that someone was actually trying to break into the house.&nbsp;
The police heard the noises and told us to stay upstairs until they got
there.&nbsp; My brother and a bunch of his friends walked in at this point
and we started to accuse them when there was another noise outside and
my brother went out to investigate.&nbsp; I SAW him chase someone down
the street in a plaid coat and then the person just vanished.</b>
<br><b>My friend and I were hysterical by this time and the police had
just arrived.&nbsp; They brought canine dogs and the ONLY scent they picked
up was my brother&#8217;s and that is because he had chased someone out of the
yard.&nbsp; The dogs didn&#8217;t pick up anything else and there were NO footprints
anywhere except the police and ours.&nbsp; My Dad came home and my brother
and his friends swore it wasn&#8217;t them.&nbsp; When the morning came, we all
went out to check under the kitchen window for evidence it was my brother,
and there was just no way that anyone could have just reached up the way
that hand reached up.</b>
<br><b>There was also the time that I came home and the upstairs extension
picked up while I was on the phone.&nbsp; I thought my friend had someone
over or a party line (small towns used to have this where 2 different residences
shared the same phone line).&nbsp; She thought I was trying to scare her
because we could both hear breathing.&nbsp; I snuck to the stairs and saw
the shadow of a man.&nbsp; I freaked out, grabbed a knife and ran out the
door.&nbsp; I called my sister down the street to come and there was no
way anyone could have gotten out but no one was there when it was checked
out.</b>
<br><b>There were also the glowing eyes in the bushes up the street.&nbsp;
I used to see those frequently at night and once in awhile was brave enough
to go and check it out to see if there was a dog in the bushes peering
out.&nbsp; There never was and the hairs on neck would stand straight up
on end.&nbsp; I wasn&#8217;t the only person to see this or feel this way about
those bushes.&nbsp; Quite a few houses in the area were haunted as well.</b>
<br><b>I would hear a man&#8217;s voice in the house where I babysat and so did
the girl I babysat.&nbsp; It was detached and floating in the air.&nbsp;
You would feel tugs on your shirt when your back was turned and lights
in the basement would flick on and off.&nbsp; A friend of mine who is completely
skeptic lived in the house previously and had confided in me that she thought
something weird was going on in the house.&nbsp; She slept upstairs and
everyday she would look in the cubbyhole in the wall and there was a sleeping
bag unrolled and an imprint of a body on it and everyday she would roll
it up and put it away only to find it there in the morning again or by
the time she got home from school.&nbsp; She showed me this one day which
made me uneasy about taking the babysitting job there when new people moved
in.</b>
<br><b>There is so much more but honestly, I am getting tired and drained
out.&nbsp; If you want to hear more, let me know.</b><b></b>

<br><b>The Motel Room</b><b></b>

<p><b>By: reezymj@xtra.co.nz</b><b></b>

</p><p><b>This happened while I was holidaying in Florida at a motel we have
stayed at several times.&nbsp;&nbsp; The last time we stayed&nbsp; here
we were in room 12.&nbsp; While in room 12, we would always hear arguements
from next door and the occupants would always check out usually within
1 or 2 days, never staying longer.&nbsp;&nbsp; My husband loves America
especially Florida, as it happens I was to have an operation in Florida
and this was a good time to visit.&nbsp; We checked in at the same motel
and my husband wanted the room in which we had stayed in before, room 12.&nbsp;
Unfortunately it was taken, so we had to take the room next door.&nbsp;
This motel does not have room 13 so the room is renumbered 14.&nbsp; I
did feel uneasy about staying in that room, let's just say a nagging feeling,
an intuition which i always trust(I come from a long line of witches and
ancestors with psychic/paranormal abilities&nbsp; from both my parents
side.) not because of the number, but from remembering the countless couples
that came and went from that room.&nbsp;&nbsp; My husband insisted we stay
there, since it was next to room 12 and the happy memories of the last
holiday we had there.&nbsp; I gave in and we checked in.&nbsp; We unpacked
our things and from day 1 we had an arguement the whole entire time we
were there,&nbsp; I thought to my self, maybe it was me subconciously dreading
the operation and taking it&nbsp; out on him,&nbsp; but we would be at
each other like cats and dogs to the point where I walked out of that room(
a couple of times).&nbsp; the atmosphere would be charged and depressing,
and as soon as I walked out the sun would lift my spirits.&nbsp; My husband
is not superstitious, nor does he believe in ghostly encounters. After
having my operation, i would have to be bedridden for a week or so, and
heavily under the influence of painkillers.&nbsp; While I lay in bed, I
would chase my husband away with my bad moods(post op blues), so I could
be left alone and in peace.&nbsp; The time I had alone in that room would
stay with me for a long time.&nbsp; Remember I had taken some painkillers
for my operation, my husband had drawn the curtains so I could sleep.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
One afternoon, I dozed off and was awaken by the tug of the bedsheets.&nbsp;
I thought maybe I kicked it off, so I tried to pull them up, once I did,
I fell asleep again, again i was awaken by the feeling of sheets being
tugged.&nbsp; I thought it was my husband, and woke up shouting at him,
but there was no one in the room.&nbsp; I felt the temperature in the room
was cold, I shivered and had to force myself&nbsp; in great pain to get
out of bed and pull the sheets up.&nbsp; Once in bed, I looked around the
room, the strange thing was it seemed like shadows in the corner yet it
was bright as day outside and the curtains were drawn and there were no
trees or anything near the window to give off shadows... I&nbsp; stayed
awake for hours waiting for my husband to return.&nbsp; He walked in and
got a shock seeing me all wide eyed and thought he had left the airconditioner
on as it was very cool.&nbsp; He walked over and noticed it was off and
blamed that the damn thing was broken.&nbsp; For the whole week while i
recuperated in that room by myself during the day,&nbsp; my bedsheets would
come off, I would wake up in cold sweats looking around the room, there
was no one.&nbsp; I felt something brushing my skin and always the shadows
in the corner.&nbsp; I put it down to painkillers(they were very mild)
and my usually happy self became withdrawn and depressed.&nbsp; I noticed
that my husband would come back smiling and was&nbsp; trying to cheer me&nbsp;
up but as we stayed longer in that room, it seemed to have an effect on
us.&nbsp; He became mean and sometimes he would jeer at me.&nbsp; I had
enough by this time and wanted to leave.&nbsp; The last night&nbsp; we
stayed there, I had not taken any painkillers as I wanted to believe i
was not hallucinating or seeing things(belive me, I have seen things and
experienced stranger) I was not sleeping well and looked over to my husband
who slept soundly, the funny thing was he seemed to be illuminated by something,
I tried to touch him but my hand could not move.&nbsp; I stretched out
to him(we slept in separate beds, while I was recuperating) he was only
an armslength away, and yet I couldn't move.&nbsp; I was sweating now,
with a feeling of dread, my whole body felt like lead and I could only
move my head.&nbsp; I tried so hard to move yet i couldn't.&nbsp; I could
feel that there was someone/something was in the room but I couldn't see
them, someone was there near my bed but not fully visible yet.&nbsp; I
started to say something and tried to call out to my husband.&nbsp; He
was dead asleep and did not move, as I turned my head to the foot of my
bed, my sheets were being tugged off,&nbsp; I really screamed, but nothing
came out, I was forcing myself to say something, but nothing came.&nbsp;
At the foot of my bed appeared a tall black outline, the figure seemed
to be wearing a hooded cloak, but I had a profile view, it had its outstreched
arm on my bed(I am 6ft tall and my feet are slightly stuck out over the
bed).&nbsp; I tried to move my feet to kick out, but my limbs were like
deadweights.&nbsp; The black garbed figure turned to me and began to walk
towards me, at this moment i was desperately repeating the Lord's prayer(I'm
not religious but it came to mind) over and over and as it began to walk
to me, i remember the eyes started to glow red.&nbsp; At this stage I was
turning my head to and fro from the figure to my husband as well as stretching
my arm out&nbsp; trying to touch him to wake up, I remember him sleeping
soundly like a baby.</b>
<br><b>As the figure approached, and I was sweating buckets and repeatingly
saying the Lord's prayer,&nbsp;&nbsp; I yelled out "Stop, and that I worshipped
only God and that I belonged to him",a couple of times and the figure was
no longer there.&nbsp;&nbsp; I blinked a couple of times thinking it was
a nightmare, but i noticed that my arm was still outstrecthed towards my
husband, and he was still in the same position sleeping soundly, I started
crying and busted open a stitch, my husband woke up and said I just had
a very bad nightmare.&nbsp; I said I'm glad that we were&nbsp; leaving
that very morning.&nbsp; We will still go back to the motel as my husband
loves it, yet i insisted we do not stay in that room.</b><b></b>

<p><b>The Haunted School House</b><b></b>

</p><p><b>By: m_gattis@bellsouth.net</b><b></b>

</p><p><b>In 1996 my family a I moved into a house that once was a school house
to poor farm families of that area.&nbsp; We rented from a very sweet man
who now has passed. We gave us alittle information about the house when
we moved in. He told of the school burning and them rebuilding and his
Father buying it from the district. They added rooms as their family grew.&nbsp;
They added on to the master bedroom what he called the baby room it was
a small room about 10x8 foot, where after the children were born would
stay until they were a year old.&nbsp; We lived there about a year before
we had our first experince.&nbsp; We were in the living room when we smelled
smoke from the back of the house.&nbsp; We went to check it out and found
nothing.&nbsp; To be safe we had the fire department come out.&nbsp; They
found nothing unusal and told us that it wasn't unusal that back a long
time ago they would just build over the damaged parts and it may have been
just the order of the smoke coming threw.&nbsp; We dismissed it as that.&nbsp;
Well about a&nbsp; week later my teenage cousin moved in as like any teenager
had her room amess.&nbsp; I told her she needed to clean her room and make
her bed well she spent most of the day doing that when she got done she
came into the living room and was watching tv when i went in her room and
told her to come back and make the bed. She said :"Missy, I did."&nbsp;
I told her to remake make it and leave the door open when she got done.
I went into the living room and sat in the chair by her door when she got
done she came back into the living room and out of the corner of my eye
I could see her blackets come off the bed and a lay very softly on the
floor at the foot of the bed.&nbsp; We both went into the room and I told
whatever "it" was that we were going to make the bed again and this time
:"it" better leave it like it was.&nbsp; We made the bed again, and closed
the door, went back to check again and the bed was made but there was a
dent where someone or something had sat on the bed.&nbsp; This was not
the only room in the house that had things happen it.&nbsp; My son and
daughter both had a bed in the "baby's" room when i woke one night dreamy
that my son's bed was shaking so I went into the room and he was sitting
up hanging on the bed as it went back to the floor saying my bed was shaking
so, I took him to my bed and went to get my daughter who was sitting up
looking at me&nbsp; holding on so tight that i had to pire her hands off
her bed.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; Once my mother came to sit with my daughter while my husband
and son went out for awhile when we got back they were sitting on the porch
with a bat in her hand. I had to laugh at her cause if something was outside
why sit outside with it and then she told me about a ball bouncing down
the hall.&nbsp; Again I laughed at her and said there is noway i put the
ball at the bottom of the toy chest cause i kept tripping over it. (my
daughter could not walk yet) My mother said she was rocking my daughter
by the door, when the ball bounced out of the chest down the hall then
back up the hall and into the chest again.&nbsp; The bedroom was at least
20 foot long as was the living room and hall.&nbsp; When i went into the
bedroom to look the ball was sitting on top of the toy chest.&nbsp; Needless
to say my Mother would never sit for me again in the house.&nbsp; The last
a final straw was about a month later.&nbsp; My kids were at my mothers
and my cousin visiting her aunt&nbsp; my husband had just gotten into bed
when we heard a knock at the door.&nbsp; My husband got up and went to
front, knowing no one was there cuase we could see from our window that
noone walked onto the porch. He looked out and sure enough no one was there.
He came back to bed and heard it again so, he went to the backdoor and
there was no one again, as he was coming back to bed he closed the hall&nbsp;
door.&nbsp; As he was getting back in bed he said there shouldnt be anymore
of this.&nbsp; About the time he said that there was a loud banging not
a knock this time. We both got up this time to see what it was and got
to the hall door and was just about to open it when it started to rattle
and shake violently.&nbsp; There was a feeling of dread so bad that we
both ran back to room, by the time I made it to the room he was dressed
and was dragging in my t-shirt out the door.&nbsp; He went the next day
and moved us out.&nbsp; To this day we don't know what was there.&nbsp;
I recently drove by where the house was and it has burned to nothing but
a chimney.</b><b></b>

<p><b>The Farmhouse Ghosts</b><b></b>

</p><p><b>By: lyn@greenhills.net</b><b></b>

</p><p><b>I grew up on a farm in Mo. The house we lived in was built around
the turn of the century.&nbsp; It was a big two story house with a wraparound
porch. I shared a bedroom with my brother on the bottom floor.&nbsp; In
the summer of 1975 something happened that had a long term effect on me.
It was a clear moonlit night, and you could easily hear crickets and bullfrogs
singing in the night. I was sleeping very soundly when something woke me.
I had the impression that someone was pushing down several times on the
foot of the bed.&nbsp; I looked up and was startled to see the shadow of
a short,plump figure watching me. Horrified, I immediately went for the
light, but there was nothing there.&nbsp; The figure I had seen had no
face, but seemed to have a soft glow. It was defintly trying to get my
attention. I never went to sleep the rest of the night, leaving the light
on and reading.&nbsp; The next night, about the same time, I was awake
and witnessed a small ball of light zipping around the room. This time
I left the light off and watched the tiny orb for about fifteen seconds
when it finally zipped out of the room.&nbsp; I talked to certain family
members later and found out that apparition that I had seen was probably
my great grandmother. She had died in the same corner that my bed was sitting.
In her later years, she began to lose her mind, and instead of putting
her in a nursing home, the family decided to take care of her at home.
They hired a male nurse to help and the night that I saw her, my uncle
said she was probably looking for him. The incident disturbed me deeply
and it was years before I could sleep well at night.&nbsp; I am now married
and live in another old house but this one seems to have no past to disturb
me.</b>

<br><b>My Uncle Spike</b><b></b>

<p><b>By: TabithaW@SafecoLandTitle.com</b><b></b>

</p><p><b>This is actually something that happened to my Mother...She used
to be a</b>
<br><b>non-believer but this changed everything for her...</b>
<br><b>My Uncle Spike was my favorite Uncle. Me and my sisters just thought
he was</b>
<br><b>the best! Ya know, he was the kind of Uncle that would empty out
his pockets</b>
<br><b>when the ice cream man would come around and when I had a loose
tooth he</b>
<br><b>would always make extra sure that I didn't feel it come out. Well,
We all</b>
<br><b>got the shock of our lives on May 18, 2002. We got a phone call
at about 11</b>
<br><b>o'clock at night. It was my grandma telling us that Spike had been
killed in</b>
<br><b>a motorcycle accident. An oncoming car tried to pass another and
hit him</b>
<br><b>head-on. His passions in life were his family and his bike. That
is the way</b>
<br><b>he would have wanted to go. Even though this gave us a little comfort</b>
<br><b>knowing that he wouldn't have had it another way, We were still
completely</b>
<br><b>devastated. He was involved in a motorcycle club so off and on throughout</b>
<br><b>the next year we went to benefits to help out other fallen Brothers
and</b>
<br><b>their families, and to raise money to pay for the unexpected funeral.
We</b>
<br><b>were on our way to his Brotherhood's Clubhouse in Clovis New Mexico
and I</b>
<br><b>was driving my Dad's truck behind my Mom &amp; my Dad...(Both were
on bikes,</b>
<br><b>sort of a tribute to Spike)...My dad was riding alone and my youngest</b>
<br><b>sister, Olivia, was on the back of my Mom's bike. Olivia is the
sort of 12</b>
<br><b>year-old that can't sit still...She wiggles and shifts her weight</b>
<br><b>constantly. And for any experienced rider, this can be sort of difficult
to</b>
<br><b>handle. The more my sister moved, the more my Mom started to loose
control</b>
<br><b>of the bike. She said she could feel the bike start to lay over
and that she</b>
<br><b>could see she tires start to come out from under her. She kept thinking,
"Oh</b>
<br><b>my god, I'm going to lay this bike over...Oh, no! Janie straighten
up!"</b>
<br><b>Next, She said she heard someone's voice that sounded all too familiar.
She</b>
<br><b>said she heard Spike whisper in her ear, "It's O.K. Baby, I gottcha.
I won't</b>
<br><b>let anything happen to you." And the bike pulled straight up again
like</b>
<br><b>nothing ever went wrong. Needless to say, My Mom was a little freaked.
She</b>
<br><b>pulled over straight away...By the time I stopped and got to her,
she was in</b>
<br><b>tears. She said, "He caught me and helped me up again, He didn't
let me</b>
<br><b>fall". She was hysterical. Then she stopped and stared at the bike...I</b>
<br><b>swear, We could all feel his presence. She swore up and down that
she could</b>
<br><b>see him sitting on the bike.</b>
<br><b>I know that he still watches over us all...</b>

<p><b>My First Home</b><b></b>

</p><p><b>By: jreg3hac@yahoo.com</b><b></b>

</p><p><b>In 1999 my husband and I purchased our first home.&nbsp; We</b>
<br><b>had two very small children at the time and soon found</b>
<br><b>out we were expecting our third.&nbsp; We had purchased and</b>
<br><b>old Queen Anne Victorian.&nbsp; It was very large and all</b>
<br><b>the homes around it were large as well.&nbsp; We had looked</b>
<br><b>at many houses before we purchased the old home.&nbsp; In</b>
<br><b>fact I drove past the home to go to work every day. I</b>
<br><b>had never considered buying it but always felt drawn</b>
<br><b>to it.&nbsp; Things seemed fine.&nbsp; I was alone in the home</b>
<br><b>when I heard what seemed to be a child laughing.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>thought maybe my family had come home early but no one</b>
<br><b>was there.&nbsp; One other time, I was in the cellar</b>
<br><b>getting clothes out of the dryer and heard a child</b>
<br><b>call Mommy but again I was alone when this occured and</b>
<br><b>none of the neighbors children were outside.&nbsp; I was</b>
<br><b>lying in my bedroom with my eyes closed&nbsp; and could</b>
<br><b>feel something like breath on me when I opened my</b>
<br><b>eyes nothing was there.&nbsp; I have a cat who likes to go</b>
<br><b>outside at night and one evening my husband heard her</b>
<br><b>at the door.&nbsp; He opened the door and let her in or so</b>
<br><b>he thought.&nbsp; The next morning he saw our cat waiting</b>
<br><b>on the porch for us to let her in.&nbsp; We searched the</b>
<br><b>entire home looking for the cat he had thought he let</b>
<br><b>in the previous evening and there was no animal to be</b>
<br><b>found. My daughter who was 3 and a half at the time,</b>
<br><b>would come into our bedroom complaining that the</b>
<br><b>little girl would keep her awake and would not stop</b>
<br><b>playing with the curtains. She would also complain</b>
<br><b>about the man who would whisper by her closet.&nbsp; My</b>
<br><b>mother and I were hanging wallpaper in the family room</b>
<br><b>which was next to the dining room.&nbsp; My mother was</b>
<br><b>facing the doorway to the dining area i had the door</b>
<br><b>to my side.&nbsp; As we were hanging a portion of the paper</b>
<br><b>we both saw a figure move through the dining area and</b>
<br><b>into the kitchen.&nbsp; My mother said oh good dan is home</b>
<br><b>he can help us hang.&nbsp; I called to my husband and asked</b>
<br><b>if he had eaten lunch yet. I got no response.</b>
<br><b>Thinking he could not hear I went to the kitchen to</b>
<br><b>ask again.&nbsp; He was not there.&nbsp; I called thinking he</b>
<br><b>went upstairs and still no answer.&nbsp; My mother and I</b>
<br><b>checked the whole house and looked outside for the</b>
<br><b>car.&nbsp; No one was there but her and I!&nbsp; It was a</b>
<br><b>strange feeling.&nbsp; Sometimes lights would go on for no</b>
<br><b>reason.&nbsp; We would hear someone climbing the steps. It</b>
<br><b>was a little unsettling but we no longer live in the</b>

<br><b>My Account of a Haunting</b><b></b>

<p><b>By: aevalnocturne@earthlink.net</b><b></b>

</p><p><b>The &#8220;story&#8221; that follows is a true account of&nbsp; an 11 year experience
that I will never forget.</b>
<br><b>When I was 6 years old, my family moved into an old Victorian home
in Pontiac, Michigan. The address was 340 N. Saginaw. The house still stands
today,and has changed owners several times, but is in a state of disrepair.</b>
<br><b>The house had been built in 1892 by a Mr. Neusbaumer for himself
, wife and children.My parents had purchased the home from Clara Neusbaumer,
the last living daughter and heir.</b>
<br><b>I remember moving in that day, because even as a young child, I
felt a sense of uneasiness.That feeling was soon to be validated.</b>
<br><b>At first, it was more of just an uneasy feeling throughout the whole
house. Soon I discovered, however, that the feeling intensified while in
my room. It was a large, 4 bedroom home, and us three girls all had the
luxury of having a bedroom all to ourselves.Mine was in the back of the
house, next to my parents room, and across the upstairs foyer from my other
two sisters.</b>
<br><b>When alone in my room, I began to feel as though I were being watched.
It is a universal,primitive feeling. I would be sitting at my desk doing
homework, or just laying across my bed listening to my stereo, and I would
feel it. I felt that a presence was emenating from one corner in my room,
up at the ceiling. I had not seen or heard anything up until this point,
but that was soon to change.</b>
<br><b>As I was alone in my room again one day after school, I heard a
voice call my name.It was a male voice, and I had thought it was my father.
I went out into the foyer to answer his call,but since he was not home
from work yet, it could not have been him. I went back into my room, and
soon heard the voice again. I say that I heard it, but it occurred to me
several years after the fact, that I only &#8220;heard&#8221; it in my mind. A sort
of telepathic communication, I think.</b>
<br><b>It wasn&#8217;t long before this voice became an everyday intrusion into
my life. It would call my name repeatedly. It would assure me that it was
ok, and for me not to be afraid.It also told me to come closer to the corner
from where it was coming. I remember now, that I would be drawn to it,
and would stand there transfixed, trancelike, staring at the corner.I never
went close to it, call it instinct, fear, whatever, but I somehow knew
better.</b>
<br><b>As I was staring at the corner one day, a huge void opened up in
the corner. It was the blackest black I have ever seen.I saw nothing in
the gaping hole, but it seemed to go on forever, and I would grow lightheaded
and lost blocks of time staring into it. Now, I had told my younger sister
all about this, but she never saw or felt anything&#8230; until we actually moved
out of the house. But I will get to that later. I was afraid to tell my
parents, and had been warned by the voice, that this was &#8220;our&#8221; secret,
no need for me to tell.</b>
<br><b>The voice began to torment me, even at night, as I lie in my bed
sleeping. I could feel it there in the dark, beckoning.It invaded my dreams,
becoming ever more insistent that I succumb to it&#8217;s wish that I come into
the void.It was angry at me, growling insults and obscenities, but I never
would give in. Towards the end of our stay in that house, I began arguing
back, telling it that I was stronger than it, and would not be overpowered.
Strangely enough, over all those years, I had come to accept it&#8217;s presence
as a normal part of life for me.No one ever saw or felt it but me. I had
even confided in my best friend Shirley, who would frequently come for
sleepovers.I think she slept with one eye on the corner.</b>
<br><b>The day we moved out, I experienced the most intense terror I will
ever feel for the rest of my life. I was then 17. I was in my room, packing
up a few last minute items. I felt the familiar goosebumps and tingling
of my skin, as the hair on the back of my neck and arms stood up.The voice
was at a fervored pitch now, threatening and cursing me.I turned around
to face my enemy, stared into the blackness, and was mesmerized to see&nbsp;
the most evil eyes I had aver seen, come out of the darkness. I could see
the whites of his eyes, and the center was like black coal. The hole began
to turn, and I heard a deafening roaring sound, not unlike that of a huge
waterfall in close proximity.</b>
<br><b>I dropped what I was doing, ran down the steps, and got into the
family car. I left the rest of my things in that room, and never looked
back.</b>
<br><b>I never heard or saw anything like that again. After we had moved
out, my younger sister began having nightmares about something dark and
heavy&nbsp; chasing her in our old house. No coincidence, I think.</b>
<br><b>I still get the chills when I think about this. I assure you, this
was real.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Many Haunted Places in Greenfield Indiana.</b><b></b>

</p><p><b>By: PURRrrRRP@aol.com</b>

<br><b>My friends and I love to get frightened, so we spend alot of our
time investigating creepy looking places, and alot of strange things have
happened to us.</b>
<br><b>-There is a haunted church off of Davis Road.&nbsp; Sometimes at
night you can see little children playing together outside.</b>
<br><b>-There used to be a busy railroad in Greenfield, but has long been
deserted.&nbsp; The tracks have been removed, but you can still see where
they once lay.&nbsp; There has been reports of sightings of a man that
got killed on the old railroad tracks.</b>
<br><b>-There is a cemetery in Shelby County by the name of Gilboa Cemetery.&nbsp;
This place is very haunted.&nbsp; The ground is always fresh and lumpy
and full of flies.&nbsp; I have heard voices of a man and boy talking in
the field next to it.&nbsp; There was clearly nobody there.&nbsp; There
are a line of graves of little babies that died on the same day only years
apart.&nbsp; There are about five of them.&nbsp; There were also baby food
jars lined up across them with some strange goo inside.&nbsp; the next
day when i returned, the jars were broken.&nbsp; There was a huge tree
that seemed to have grown overnight and got hit by lightning.&nbsp; It
is very creepy looking.&nbsp; Whatever you do, keep the gates shut! you
can feel the evil telling you to leave.&nbsp; I recommend not going in
at night!!!!</b>
<br><b>-I have heard of a Gypse graveyard somewhere before you get to Fortville.&nbsp;
There is a graveyard on a curve of the road.&nbsp; there are fingers on
the graves pointing to s trail into a field.&nbsp; through the field is
the gypse graveyard.&nbsp; I have not seen it, but i know people who say
they have been.&nbsp; when i tried to go through the field and into the
woods, i got attacked by june bugs, and left.&nbsp; There are sparkles
on the dirt by all of the graves.</b>
<br><b>-There are a few haunted old buildings around the downtown area,
but I'm not sure how to describe them.</b>
<br><b>-There was an old abandoned apartment building off of Gem Rd. and
40, that was torn down recently.&nbsp; But I walked inside of the door
and heard someone moaning.</b>
<br><b>-there is an old cemetery next to an old abandoned school on the
back roads of shelby county.&nbsp; there is a gravestone of a little boy.&nbsp;

stories about noises(doors opening,water fountain coming on etc.) and sightings.&nbsp;
One paramedic even claimed that he had a person hovering over him in the
evening.&nbsp;&nbsp; A county ambulance got stationed there in the 1970's
and his sightings became less frequent.</b>

</p><p><b>I was looking on your site and noticed that you had the date for
the Tornado of 1974 wrong.&nbsp; It wasn&#8217;t in May it was April 3, 1974.&nbsp;
I went to Meade County High School and I knew of the history.&nbsp; I will
tell you one of my stories that happened while going to school there.</b>
<br><b>I was in band thru high school.&nbsp; When we went to competitions
for marching band, we usually got back late on Saturday nights.&nbsp; No
one would be at the high school except the band students that went to the
competition.&nbsp; One of these occasions, a friend of mine and I where
the first ones off the bus to go upstairs.&nbsp; A lot of the time, we
wasn&#8217;t the first people but for some reason we where this time.&nbsp; No
one had gone up before us and we where turning on the lights while heading
up to get ready to head home after everything was unloaded and put away.&nbsp;
Also, normally there where four bus&#8217;s of students and on this night, we
rode the first bus and the other three where stopped at a light and hadn&#8217;t
caught up to us yet.</b>
<br><b>Heading up the stairs we where talking and we had to go to our lockers
to get some books to take home for weekend homework we both had.&nbsp;
We just was quiet walking down the hallway when out of no where we started
to hear lockers slamming shut and toilets flushing in the boys bathroom.&nbsp;
I started to feel very cold and she just looked at me and goes &#8220;do you
feel that&#8221;.&nbsp; Both of our lockers where in the same roll which was
beside the boys bathroom.&nbsp; After hearing the noises, both of us decided
to go back to the band room and wait until everyone else started to come
up.&nbsp; After more people got up there, we went to our lockers and got
what we needed.&nbsp; That time it was quiet except for people talking.</b>
<br><b>Another story of mine is about the gym.&nbsp; Over the years and
after all the stories were out, no one ever said anything else about the
history of what happened that day.&nbsp; My mom has told me about it but
if you go back and pull up the old papers, you hardly get the full picture
of what happened to Brandenburg that day.&nbsp; She told me that all the
bodies had to be set on the bleachers in order for them to all fit.</b>
<br><b>No matter when it was, when I walked into that gym, it was always
so very cold.&nbsp; Even with the heat on, that place would never warm
up.&nbsp; Some places in that gym was even colder then some but it seemed
to be like walking into a walk in freezer.&nbsp; I never did hear a story
about anyone experiences in there.</b>
<br><b>I know they redone the gym after I graduated in 1994.&nbsp; Most
of the entire building has been redone.&nbsp; The band room no longer has
the windows in which stayed in the story about the tuba ghost.&nbsp; Other
wings also have been added.&nbsp; It looks like a totally different school
now then what it was when I went there.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Double murder @ University... in D.C.</b><b></b>

</p><p><b>By: flamethestars@hotmail.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>

</p><p><b>My bestfriend, Eric, was murdered at his college, in Washington DC,
three</b>
<br><b>years ago. He was a freshman and was only at the college for a couple
of</b>
<br><b>weeks. I was a sophomore in high school at the time. It was a truly</b>
<br><b>devasting time for me, especially when we all thought he was murdered</b>
<br><b>because of his homosexuality. Later, we found out that the only
reason for</b>
<br><b>his death was money. His murderer was desperate to gain access into
porn</b>
<br><b>sites on the internet and purchase baby clothes. Eric was an easy
victim</b>
<br><b>because he had a mild case of cerebal palsy even though he was very</b>
<br><b>intellectual. Several months later, another boy was murdered for
the same</b>
<br><b>reason... by the same killer. Now the killer is serving double life</b>
<br><b>sentences in jail.</b>
<br><b>Anyway, the night I found out.. I missed several classes and went
home</b>
<br><b>immediately [I attended a boarding school and my home was like,
3 hours</b>
<br><b>away]. I cried all day. Also cried myself to sleep. I woke up because
I felt</b>
<br><b>somebody rubbing my back. I wasn't imagining it at all because whoever
was</b>
<br><b>rubbing my back didn't stop after I woke up. I rolled away because
I was</b>
<br><b>feeling annoyed. I WAS TIRED, of course, from crying so much. I
calmly told</b>
<br><b>myself it was my mom. She must have heard me and got up to console
me, so I</b>
<br><b>just went back to sleep.</b>
<br><b>You know when somebody sits at the edge of your bed, it would bend
down a</b>
<br><b>little? I felt somebody moving, as if someone was getting up.. and
felt the</b>
<br><b>corner of the bed settle back into place.. so I looked from under
the covers</b>
<br><b>[I tend to bury myself under the covers.. amazing how I'm able to
breathe</b>
<br><b>with all the layers of blankets on me] and saw him. It was truly
amazing. It</b>
<br><b>was as if I was seeing him in person again.. he was wearing a t-shirt
with</b>
<br><b>his college's name on it, but part of his head was covered in blood
[he was</b>
<br><b>beaten to death with a metal folding chair and a bat]. It was kind
of</b>
<br><b>bothersome, but it didn't really strike me at the moment because
all I cared</b>
<br><b>about was seeing him again.</b>
<br><b>[I talked to him online just two days prior his death.. I was going
to walk</b>
<br><b>into town with some friends. His last message was 'Please be careful
in town</b>
<br><b>after dark, luv ya']</b>
<br><b>Anyway, I didn't think he would say anything to me because in most
cases,</b>
<br><b>ghosts usually don't talk.. they just appear and then disappear
without</b>
<br><b>saying a word or two, right? Well he said something like, 'ALWAYS
look after</b>
<br><b>yourself, no matter what... no matter where you go.. I'll be there'</b>
<br><b>Stupidly, I didn't say anything, just stared at him.. I was in extreme</b>
<br><b>shock. The back-rubbings continued for a short while then it all
stopped.</b>
<br><b>To make sure I wasn't seeing things, I asked my mom the next morning
if she</b>
<br><b>had went into my room at all during the previous night. She gave
me a</b>
<br><b>strange, but concerned look and said she hadn't. She slept like
a rock. Can</b>
<br><b>we say, creepy? I saw him again the next night... but never again
after</b>
<br><b>that. I just wish I could see him again.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Dibble/Blanchard, OK USA</b><b></b>

</p><p><b>By: DevilsWayOut@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; I lived in the said area for at least 7 or 8 years. At first
the place I lived, located on Buffalo Creek Road, seemed normal. I knew
of the previous owner's husband and how he died. It was due to a tumour
in his brain, which happened while he was still building on the trailer.
The first few years went by without anything occuring. Around four years
ago strange things began occuring. One night my brother, a few friends,
and I were sitting in my house. The room started getting very cold, unexplained
rushes of wind went by us. I started hearing flies, but could not see any.
My friend asked if there was anyone else in the house. I asked why. He
said that he saw someone's reflection from my hallway casted on a mirror
facing that direction. When we got up to the mirror one of my friend's
shirt began to glow eeriely. Needless to say, we were very spooked. I asked
for us to leave my house and go to neighboring Norman. When we went outside
we could see red lights flashing in the trees (which happened more and
more frequently, until we moved last September). I ran inside my house,
hastily put on a pair of shoes, and fled my house at three in the morning.
From then on I felt something in my house and could feel abnormal things
everywhere in that area when I went outside. It came to head one night
when I woke up in a cold sweat. It felt as though something was standing
on my chest. It was apparently a night terror of some kind, which has not
occured since leaving my old house. I could see the shadows in my room
changing, as if they were moving. From then on I have slept with my lights
on. It isn't just my old house that is odd in that area. A place known
as hippie village was supposedly an abandoned commune that is now a haven
for devil-worshippers. Everyone I know gets a bad feeling when entering
the rural parts of this area and into the town of Dibble itself. The school
of Dibble loses an average of one student every three years or so to some
kind of death. The whole area would be worth looking into if I were a paranormal
investigator, which one day I hope to do some of. I am looking forward
to visiting Bunnyman Bridge in Virginia when I get the chance to move there.
I am also going to look into Sacred Heart Cemetary which is located in
Oklahoma somewhere. Before the incidents I described I was a cynical skeptic
at best, but now I am much more ready to believe. Thanks for listening.</b>

<p><b>BLOOD CEMETERY</b><b></b>

</p><p><b>By:kuebler@ia4u.net</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;My name is Drew, and in late August in 1966, two friends of
mine Dan and Tom asked me to go with them to a party on the beach at Lake
Michigan. I was about 15 years old at that time. Ghost stories were being
told around the campfire by almost everyone their, most of which I had
already heard.</b>
<br><b>As the night went on a young girl about 17 years old started telling
a story about a family of Doctor's with the last name of Blood. It was
out on Round Lake Rd near Dewitt, MI, about 100 miles from the beach party,
but only 20 miles from my home in Lansing. The Bloods had a lot of land
where the whole family lived. The most interesting part was that they had
a private graveyard on the property and that the whole area was haunted.&nbsp;
She said that she saw gravestones that dated back to1800.</b>
<br><b>On their prom night she and some of her friends decided to go out
to the Cemetery.&nbsp; They looked around at the headstones for a while.
As it started to get dark the fog hung thick, and a full moon was rising
so they started trying to scare each other. Then the young girls' prom
date decided to go into Dr. Blood's house because he thought no one lived
there any longer. They waited about an hour or so, and when he didn't return
they got scared and headed for the Dewitt police department. When they
went in to tell the police, the officer on duty said "don't you kids know
any better, old Dr. Blood lives out there and he doesn't like anyone trespassing
on his property". He also went onto say that he thought "Dr. Blood was
harmless and he's in his 80's" so, he didn't think there would be any problem.&nbsp;
They all returned to the property, but to everyone's shock when they got
back, the whole house were ablaze.&nbsp; The fire department was called,
but in vane, because the house burnt to the ground.&nbsp; The next day
there was a search party, but the only thing that was found in the rubble
were the remains of the young man that had gone into the house the night
before. The paper reported that his hands and feet had been bound. Dr.
Blood's remains were never found.</b>
<br><b>One of the searchers that afternoon found a freshly dug grave, when
they unearthed it, a pine coffin was found. Upon opening it, they found
the body of Mrs. Blood. She was dressed in a red gown, with her arms; legs
and head cut off. There had been no coroner's report of a body being buried
there, or any police report of any murder.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;The girl at the campfire that night said that the ghost of
Dr Blood; to this day roams the cemetery at night, with a shotgun in one
hand, and an ax in the other.</b>
<br><b>That night was the last time I ever heard or saw the young girl
who first told me about Blood Cemetery, but it wouldn't be my last experience
with the Blood family.</b>
<br><b>My Story</b>
<br><b>After I returned from Lake Michigan, I told some of my friends the
story I had heard, some told me there own stories, about how they had been
scared out at the cemetery. Mark said he had seen a ghost of an old man
wandering the graveyard as if he was lost.&nbsp; Another friend said that
he saw an apparition of an elderly man carrying a body and it appeared
to be headless and armless.</b>
<br><b>Another 2 years would go by, before I got the nerve to visit this
so-called haunted Cemetery. You see I never quite believed these "ghost
stories", until I saw the most BLOOD CHILLING things myself.</b>
<br><b>The first time I went there was with Dan and JC.&nbsp; It was a
steamy hot July night. The moon was big and full and it lit up the night
sky as if it were daylight, the fog was drifting over the Cemetery as it
rolled in from the lake. The feeling in the air was electrifying.</b>
<br><b>At the entrance to the Cemetery were two old rusted iron gates,
and hanging above was a sign saying Blood Cemetery. By the light of the
moon you could see the old grave stones. Some had been toppled over, and
some were broken.&nbsp; The weeds were about knee high. There was a smell
of jasmine in the air.</b>
<br><b>After looking around for a few minutes, I decided to scare the two
of them. I had taken one of my mother's old white nightgowns and I hung
it from a fence post when I was sure they weren't looking. There was a
slight breeze in the air that night and I thought it would look like it
was floating in the breeze. Just as I was about to put my plan into action,
I heard JC scream. Dan and I went running over, he told us that he had
seen a woman's figure in a long red gown. He said that she appeared to
be headless and armless, and was coming right toward him, when she disappeared
into thin air.&nbsp; I thought that he had seen the gown I had hung on
the post. I took Dan and JC over to see where I had hung the old nightgown,
and surely what JC had saw was my little joke, but when we got there the
gown was gone.</b>
<br><b>Feeling a little spooked from what JC had thought he'd seen we started
our way out of the Cemetery to leave. On our way out I said to Dan, who
was quit a bit taller that me, pull the sign down, and we'll take it home
with us.</b>
<br><b>Our night at Blood Cemetery was pretty uneventful, except for the
woman in the red gown. We went back to Dan's farmhouse, where he lived
with his Mom, Dad, 2 brothers, and 3 sisters.&nbsp; It was late when we
got there, so the 3 of us went to bed, after putting the sign on top of
Dan's dresser. The next morning when we got up we had breakfast and got
cleaned up, Dan told his father about the sign we took the night before.
With instant anger, his father demanded to see the sign. But this task
proved not to be so easy, because when we went to the bedroom to get it,
IT WAS GONE. Dan questioned his brothers and sisters, and they all swore
they hadn't seen it, let alone take it.</b>
<br><b>After a couple of day's, of looking we were sure that Dan's brothers
and sister's had nothing to do with the missing sign. We drove back out
to Round Lake. When we got to the Cemetery, there it was hanging above
the old rusty gates was the sign we had taken two nights before, looking
like it had never been disturbed.</b>
<br><b>Several more years had gone by, when I ran into some friends at
a restaurant, on Halloween night. They talked me into going out there again.
(After all it was HALLOWEEN) When we got there the weeds were about chest
high and the fences were falling down. One of the guys in the group called
us over; he was shining his flashlight on a headstone. We couldn't believe
what we were seeing. There lying over the grave was a large piece of glass
about 6 feet long, and about 2 feet deep, incased in it were a dozen long
stem roses imbedded in the center.</b>
<br><b>Just about that time we heard a shotgun blast. We ran back to our
vehicles, and the right side of Dan's car had been shot, and the windows
had been shattered. Needless to say we got the hell out of there. With
people seeing ghosts, hearing things, and the car being shot up. I swore
I would NEVER go back out there again. But I've learned you should (NEVER
SAY, NEVER.)</b>
<br><b>When I was about 26 or 27 years old, I was riding with some motorcycle
enthusiasts. It was a beautiful June day; the skies were blue and clear.
It was hot, but who cares when you're on your bike. My girl friend Chris
rode with me on the back of my bike. She had heard so many stories about
the Blood family, she decided to bring a camera with her. We looked around
at the rundown graveyard, and Chris was taking pictures, after a few hours
we decided to leave, and all of us started down Round Lake Rd. We were
about 150 yards from the Cemetery and Chris and I hit a snapping turtle.
The bike went out of control and we crashed into a tree. I suffered only
minor injuries, but Chris had broken her back, and was paralyzed from the
waist down. She was able to walk again after a couple of years, with the
aid of crutches. (The curse of Blood Cemetery had struck again)</b>
<br><b>I've since heard lots of stories since our terrible accident.</b>
<br><b>In 1989, 2 high school girls were out to have some fun on Halloween
night. The news reported that their car went out of control about a 1/4
of a mile from the Cemetery. Their car plunged into Round Lake and they
(both drowned.)</b>
<br><b>The County has now put up hurricane fence around the Cemetery, with
razor wire strung along the top.</b>
<br><b>And I've learned that at least 4 or 5 Blood son's from each generation
have become Doctor's for the last 150 years.</b>
<br><b>And a couple of years ago, Lansing named one of their Halloween
haunted house's after Blood Cemetery.</b>
<br><b>If you're ever out on Round Lake Rd, and you see a full moon rising,
DON'T visit Blood Cemetery.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Balloons</b><b></b>

I'm crazy but it is true!&nbsp; When I was younger I woke up because I
was freezing,&nbsp; and a balloon was coming closer and closer to me, I
did not have a fan of anything and it was coming towards me.&nbsp; Well
like I said I was younger so I had my parents take it out of my room.&nbsp;
I woke up earlier that morning, before my parents did, and the balloon
was banging on the door.</b>
<br><b>Another time I woke up because I heard something but I didn't think
anything of it.&nbsp; I couldn't go back to sleep after that so I just
stared at the wall, then I heard the sound again so I looked at the TV
and there was a blury figure so I sat up, the blury figure turned around
and floated towards the do.&nbsp; When it got closer to me I could see
it more clearly, it look like it was wearing hunting clothes, then it went

</p><p><b>A story from My Birthplace~England</b><b></b>

</p><p><b>By: steinn@frontiernet.net</b><b></b>

</p><p><b>I will try not to take up too much space. I will condense a compilation
of stories that my parents and siblings have told me since I can remember.
These stories used to bring tears to my eyes, and I am so very glad I was
not a part of it. Around 1974, in Lakenheath, England, my parents and two
brothers and sister lived in a very old three story stacked home that is
very common of the United Kingdom. There was a basement, a first floor,
2nd, and third floor. My sister was about 11 or twelve, my brothers were
10 and 7. My father was a no-nonsense individual, Military and stern. My
mother was a military wife, and a little more believing in such things.
A few things that can be presented quickly are the sounds that were heard
from the kitchen on the first floor. No onw culd describe these sounds,
just that they were awful. The dog would never go into the kitchen, nor
would she ever travel up the stairs. My brother went into the bathroom
on the second floor one night and thought my father was standing in the
doorway in the moonlight, as my brother saw the moonlight glinting off
of my dads glasses. He said, "Dad?", and the image turned away. He knew
it turned away because the glasses turned away to one side and were gone.
This same brother would park his matchbox cars all along the wall everynight
at bed time. He was repetedly woken up in the middle of the night to the
sound of his cars rolling across the floor. my parents would hear it also
and come up to the third floor where the boys room was, and yell at my
brother to go to bed. he would get cought out of bed pushing the cars back
against the wall, so as not to get into trouble the next morning and would
get caught out of bed. needless to say, her startrd putting the cars back
in the morning. he also woke up in bed facing the lighted hallway and said
the hallway went on "forever". it was lined with doors. he remembers seeing
all the doorknobs sticking out, but one of them was turning, he hid under
the covers, and waited till morning. My youngest brother wouldn't even
go to the bathroom, he would chance a beating and just pee over the railing.
My sister was going up the stairs to bed one nigh, behind my brothers and
father, and they all heard heavy breathing and stomping coming up the stairs
behind her. (this is when they all finally confessed to eachother that
these things were happening.) One evening, my parents had just come home
with the kids. my sibs and mom went to watch tv in the frontroom. my dad
went into the kitchen to fix some tea. now, my dad is a "bathroom specialist."
don't go in there when he's fixing to go in for a "while." he told my mom
this, not to go in there, he was goin' in there, and started making his
tea. out of the corner of his eye, he saw my mother, dressed in her white
turtleneck dress and dark hair up in a bun,(what she was wearing that evening)
go past the kitchen doorway and into the bathroom. he walks into the frontroom
ready to be all mad, and there sat my mother. he asked her why had she
gone in there, when he asked her not to? before she could answer, he realized
that there is no entrance to the bathroom in that direction, and said "never
mind." the back door would be deadbolted every night, and every morning
be sitting wide open. my brothers had to go down to the basement to get
a bucket of coal for the stove. you had to shut the light off down there
and come up the stairs in the dark. they would do this chore, shut the
door, and go put the coal in the stove. my father would go into the kitchen
later that night, and find the door to the basement open, and the light
on. he would yell for the boys to do the job right. they would go back
down, get the light, run up stairs, and shut the door, several times. my
father would find it again, yell again, and this time watch the boys do
it right and go to bed. later, he found that door open, light on, and never
said another word. my mom always felt something standing over her bed at
night, dad never slept w/ his back to the door, mom always felt cold and
smell sickening sweet perfume in the bedroom. she would tell IT to "go
away, you bother us at night, leave me alone during the day!" it would
obey, only to torment them with the turning off and on of the lights in
the middle of the night. the big heavy cinderblock-like door jam that held
the bedroom door open would slide across the room when mom &amp; dad turned
in almost every night. eventually, they all sat down and told each other
what was going on and decided to move out. they told the land lord that
something was wrong with his house, and he said, "yeah, I know, the neighbor
lady has a burnt little girl walking around her kitchen at night. she heard
it crying and told it to show itself one night, and it did." needless to
say, my family moved away.</b><b></b>

<p><b>A Nice Haunting</b><b></b>

</p><p><b>By: wdbd87219@aol.com</b><b></b>

</p><p><b>well I am experiencing a haunting now but it seems protective and
humorous at times. Both my daughter and myself seem to garnish the attention
now. It saved our home from fire when my husband fell asleep cooking- it
woke me with a "Get up now" voice in my head and I was able to turn everything
off and we- kid and I- have heard footsteps in our attic, my brother who
lives downstairs hears children's foot prints al thru the basement and
upper floor in the middle of night and when all other neighborhood kids
are gone for the day. My daughter (2years old) watches and or now talks
to people on ceilings and empty areas and recently we had a conversation
where I heard a "well hello there" and saw her shyly waving at space................
I feel watched constantly and also have had t.v remotes turn channels when
no one has touched them........ No pictures have caught anything but I
will continue......You should talk to Royer mansion here in williamsburg,
Pa (blair county) they have a very active haunting which I study every
year.</b>

<p><b>Travelling Ghosts</b><b></b>

</p><p><b>For close to 13 years our ghosts have grown in</b>

<br><b>smell this "old lady" perfume after the cold came.</b>
<br><b>Then the prankster appeared.&nbsp; Things would turn up</b>
<br><b>missing and we would find them later usually in the</b>
<br><b>back of the closet in a pocket of some old</b>
<br><b>clothes...$1100.00 came up missing once and a message</b>
<br><b>on the tv appeared&nbsp; "Who nds a $$$$$&nbsp; HAHAHAHAHA"&nbsp;
The</b>
<br><b>money never did show back up.&nbsp; Our 21/2 year old</b>
<br><b>granddaughter was playing in the kitchen for a long</b>
<br><b>time.&nbsp; She was talking and laughing.&nbsp; We assumed with</b>

<br><b>Very Strange House</b><b></b>

<p><b>By: Darren Scott [drrsct@optonline.net]</b><b></b>

</p><p><b>My name is Megynne Scott, if you want to contact me about this story.
Please email me at&nbsp; drrsct@optonline.net .&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you.</b>
<br><b>This story is a little long, but very worth reading. It is very
scary and very true!!! So here it is!</b>
<br><b>I live in NJ, when I was younger I had always heard about a haunted
house. My mother would never tell me where it was. One day about 4 years
ago. A friend of my mother's was visiting and I showed up and she happened
to be talking about the haunted house.. I asked her where it was, my mother
looked at her and smiled.. Now mind you I was 27 years old at the time.
So she told me just a couple of stories and then she told me where the
house was.</b>
<br><b>The story she told me was there was a lady ghost she had been seen
in the front bedroom window. She knew the people that lived in the house.
So I decided to check it out. When I got there I did see the lady in the
window; I got out of my car and walked around the house. It looked abandoned
except for the livingroom it had a sectional couch. I got in my car and
started to leave and I had a bad feeling so I started to drive away and
a black cat crossed my path.. I thought, "well this cannot be a good sign".</b>
<br><b>So the next day I was talking to my mom's friend about the house.
I had an irresistible feeling to go back to the house, but I did not until
2 weeks later. At the time I was pregnant and was going to have an ultrasound
that day. I had the ultrasound and everything was going great.</b>
<br><b>2 weeks later, I called my mom's friend and I asked her if she would
go with me to the house because I wanted to take pictures. She said OK.
So she went one way I went another. We met in front of the house. When
we got out of the car I noticed that there was someone living there. I
discussed with her that I wanted to go into the house, she was not to happy
about that.</b>
<br><b>So I knocked on the door and a young man about (late 20's early
30's) answered the door. I explained to him that there is a legend about
the house being haunted and I wanted to know if it was OK if I took some
pictures. He looked at me and said one minute. Another man came to the
door he looked a little older than the other man. Again I explained the
legend of the haunted house, remember I was only told about a woman in
the bedroom window and about the ghost did not like dogs.</b>
<br><b>So the man asked us if we wanted to come into the house for a tour.
Of course I said yes! So we went into the house, we walked through the
parlor, passed the kitchen and dinigroom and into the livingroom. There
was kitchen appliances but no diningroom table and nothing in the parlour.
When we got into the livingroom, there was the sectional couch, across
the way was a tv up against the wall. Behind the couch was stairs for upstairs.
The kitchen appliances were not there 2 weks before, neither was the TV.</b>
<br><b>This is where is gets scary!!!</b>
<br><b>So I again was talking to him about what I knew, and I started to
think about the dog situation and then I heard a dog walking up stairs.
I told this man about the dog situation and I asked him if he had a dog
he just smirked and said "yes Max".</b>
<br><b>Then we standing there talking, he was saying that he had not heard
anything and that everything was fine. I then asked him when he moved in,
he said many, many year&#8217;s ago.. I just thought, there was no way he moved
in many many years ago. It just did not look like he lived there for years.
Then he told me "I put boxes in the basement where no one goes!" I said
OK?? I did not understand why he said that.</b>
<br><b>So he asked us if we wanted to go upstairs. We said yes. As I was
walking up the stairs I had a feeling of a dead body underneath the stairs.
If anyone had a reading from me, should know I have a gift.</b>
<br><b>So we went up stairs, ended up in a hallway. Was a short hallway
there was a closet on the top of the stairs and there was a large aquarium
with a lizard in it. The light in the hallway had no cover on it, so it
was very bright. To the right was (the bedroom) that the ghost is suppose
to be in, to the left was another bedroom and at the end of the hall was
a bathroom.</b>
<br><b>We went into the bedroom to the Right and it was freezing and there
was a breeze going around the room. This was in June. There was no a/c
and no windows were open. I left that room and looked into the other bedroom
and then the bathroom and found nothing else.. Not even the dog we heard!</b>
<br><b>As we were standing in the hallway talking I noticed that the man's
eyes were dilated and that my reflection and my friends reflection were
in the aquarium but his was not.. He was standing next to me in front of
the aquarium. We went downstairs because I just had a bad feeling.</b>
<br><b>My friend pulled me to the side and said when she was coming down
the road, she saw a woman in the bathroom. She said she was wearing a white
dress.. There was no woman in the house.</b>
<br><b>I noticed when we got to the livingroom that the man that answered
the door was still sitting on the couch and had not moved. Almost like
he was frightened.</b>
<br><b>We started to talk again and we started to hear someone stomping
on the floor. We actually screamed the man just smirked.. The other man
just sat there with no expression.</b>
<br><b>So as we were going to leave I asked him if we could take some pictures,
he said yes but only of the outside and not of him or his friend. I agreed.
So I took a couple of pictures from the outside and I got a picture of
2 red eyes staring out from the doorway. Then the man asked if he could
take a picture of us, we said ok!! Stupid us!!!!</b>
<br><b>We went back to the house and discussed what we had seen and heard.
My friend decided to call her friend that lived in the house for 3 weeks!</b>
<br><b>She told her what we had done, she was very angry that we went to
the house.. I started to talk to her to find out why she was so mad. She
had told us the other stories of that house.</b>
<br><b>She said that her and her husband and 2 kids lived there for 3 weeks
and would never go back there again!!</b>
<br><b>She said that knifes were thrown across the room, crucifixes would
be turned upside down, she explained that her daughter's bedroom was the
one with the ghost and that her daughter had a figurine of a dog and every
morning the dog would be in the hallway.</b>
<br><b>She also told me that there was a place in the basement that no
one would go to.. It was a hole in the floor that had no bottom. First
she threw in little rocks, then sticks then rocks that are bigger than
your hand, she says they never hit bottom.. One time she was doing laundry
in the basement and some weird smoke stuff was coming out of there, she
got a very creepy feeling and would not go back into the basement, she
said she did laundry at the laundry mat.</b>
<br><b>She also told me about a party that she had everyone was outside
near the lake, she was inside and she decided to take a picture of everyone,
when she got the picture back she said that there was a horrible face in
the reflection in the glass.</b>
<br><b>She explained to me the reason they finally moved out. Her and her
kids were sleeping on the sectional couch that she had and her husband
was eating dinner-watching TV.. Behind the TV was a mirrored wall.. So
he was going to take a bite of his pizza and looked up and in the mirror
standing on the stairs behind him was what looked like a woman wearing
a white dress she turned and looked at him and she had horns coming out
of her head. He freaked grabbed the kids and ran them out to the vehicle
and then woke up his wife and told her not to look into the mirror behind
the TV, she asked why.. He said, "just don't" she noticed he was very scared
and serious so she agreed. He picked her up and she stated that she had
all she could do for her neck not to break. This thing was making her look
at it!!! So she looked and then screamed!!!!!</b>
<br><b>They went to a family member&#8217;s house for the night. The next day
they went back to the house to move out. They were arguing about who was
going in first.. Someone heard the argument and called the police..</b>
<br><b>The police arrived and they explained what had happened the night
before and of course the officer did not believe them.. So he said he would
go check out the house to prove that there was nothing there. After about
10-15 minutes, the officer came out of the house:</b>
<br><b>He was white as a ghost, shaking very badly and he had his gun drawn!!!
He looked at them, did not say a word and left!!!!</b>
<br><b>So they decided to leave their stuff there and that was that.. The
couch that I saw when I went into the house was the same couch that they
were on when they saw this thing.</b>
<br><b>2 weeks after I went into the house, I had to have a D&amp;C because
my baby was gone!! I had everything else there that a fetus could live,
but the baby was gone.. I asked the Dr. how is that possible to have all
of the important things available and not have a baby.. Especially when
just a couple of weeks before that I had an ultrasound and everything were
great?? He said he had no explanation..</b>
<br><b>I spoke to someone that is a paranormal investigator; She told me
that was not a ghost but a phenomenon demon..</b><b></b>

<p><b>The Palm Beacher</b><b></b>

</p><p><b>By: StReSsLeSsGrrl@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>

</p><p><b>I recently came to your site and saw that in Palm Beach Island you
have one called witch's road..... I've never heard of it.... I have heard
of Witch's Wall which is a wall of coral rock with a road carved through
it. There is a cage door on the wall used now for some sort of well pump
or spicket. I'm a Palm Beach native and I was told that the witch used
to have a shack up on top of the wall on the side the cage is on and she
used to hunt little children and lock them in the cage till they were dead
and use them for spells and enchantments. From what I've heard, if you
touch the cage you set a spirit free. But whenever I've went there the
cops always stopped and gave us crap. I, also, went to the Flagler Mansion
and saw a women's aparition in early 1900 clothing walking through the
main hall back in hmmm, 1988. I went there on a school field trip. Also,
the Breakers Hotel on Palm Beach Island is haunted.... built by Henry Flagler,
the exclusive luxury hotel has burned down twice in the early 1900s. First
in 1903 then12 years after Flagler died it burned again in 1925. I don't
know much else about the Breakers other then it's said to be haunted.</b>
<br><b>Anyhow, there's my two sense. I love your site and will think of
you if I discover any others you don't have listed.</b>

<br><b>The Lady in the Closet</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>

<p><b>By: kitsune_spirit_within@yahoo.com</b><b></b>

</p><p><b>My parents are generally quite skeptical about this kind of stuff,
but even they have to admit that something happened here.</b>
<br><b>Anyway, in about 1995, when I was four, we had been living in a
house in Maine for about a year. I came running into the kitchen to my
grandmother, who lives with us, laughing gaily and saying something about
"the lady in the closet". Now, by this age I was reading chapter books
and was quite conversational, so upon closer interrogation I told them
that there was a lady wearing a dark dress, who was in my closet, making
me laugh. My father dismissed it as my overactive imagination.</b>
<br><b>Some weeks later, my older cousin Michael(also living with us at
the time) and my father were sitting down in the living room watching television
when they heard what sounded like a woman hacking and coughing; the noise
came from my grandparents' room. They went running, thinking it was my
asthmatic grandmother, but when they arrived nothing was wrong. My grandmother
was sleeping peacefully, and my grandfather was sitting on the bed next
to her. He insisted that she had never made a noise, and that he hadn't
heard anyone coughing.</b>
<br><b>Yet later, my grandmother was completely alone in the house-- the
other members of the family were away at work, school, errands, etc. She
was cooking something, and heard a female voice say her name loudly. "Rose."
She was spooked, but ignored it and turned on music to keep her company.
Again, it spoke, louder this time, by her ear. And there was nobody in
the house.</b>
<br><b>A couple months later, Michael, who was a teenager at the time,
walked into the kitchen for a glass of water. He saw a woman with dark
hair who appeared to be my mother at the counter, chopping vegetables with
a sharp knife. He thought it was odd that she was wearing so much black
on such a hot day, but greeted her. "Hey, Aunt Virgie." She didn't turn
around or acknoledge he had spoken. He turned around to get the water out
of the fridge, but when he turned back there was no one there. No woman,
no vegetables, no knife.</b>
<br><b>Michael also had another encounter with whatever it was. He was
excersizing downstairs in the basement, and suddenly the room was ice cold
and he was a flash of white by the door. It lingered for a while before
disappearing. Freaked out, he went upstairs.</b>
<br><b>We thought it may have been one of my ancestors from the Phillipines.
It looked a lot like my mother, and seemed to like me.</b>
<br><b>Between 1994 and 2000, we had a couple more incedents involving
the lady. We moved out of the house in 2000. Nothing really has happened
since.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Im not crazy, I just believe...</b><b></b>

</p><p><b>By: kw_tristate@hotmail.com</b><b></b>

</p><p><b>At 17 I lived in this house in a smaller suburb town outside of Detroit.
I grew up in the town next to this one, but at 17 I decided to live with
friends here and there.</b>
<br><b>At one point, my best friend (no longer with us). Had talked some
other friends into letting me stay at their place. It was this old house
in the middle of this old neighborhood, you know the one neighborhood in
a town that has the oldest houses, built in the early 1900's.</b>
<br><b>This house had been separated into three apartments.&nbsp; Let me
give you a visual because it helps in my story.</b>
<br><b>Its a old house with one of those wrap around porches, but vision
a more square shaped house. The porch ran down one side, then down the
other like a right angle.</b>
<br><b>The steps were at the corner of the porch in the front, like at
the point of a right angle. The left went just accross the front and the
right went into a breezeway.</b>
<br><b>The friends apartment I stayed at was at the end of the breezeway.
A second apartment was to the left of the door where I stayed, also in
the breezeway. However the breezeway did not have a door of any sort on
it. It was more or less a wind blocker.</b>
<br><b>So first, the night I moved in, the people I stayed with told me
stories of the house being haunted. And that the two bottom apartments
where the worst off. I believed them because I had previous ghost incounters,
I believe in ghost and once they told me as usual my eyes got watery, and
tears dripped down my face, and I got the chills (on a hot summer night).
This usually happens and has always happened since I was little, whenever
I felt I was by a supernatural, or was incountered by one, or even felt
that a story was the truth for instance, if someone tells me a story about
a ghost, if I get teary watery eyes and chills, I believe them, but if
I dont, I dont think it is the truth. (Ill give you another example at
the end of my story)</b>
<br><b>So they started telling me about how they were sitting on the couch
watching TV on late night and the girl saw a guy walk into the kitchen
from the wall. She got spooked, and quietly told her boyfriend what she
thought she saw. They both just sat frozen and stared into the dark kitchen
lit up only by the TV. Then they heard a scratch on the wall, like long
nails running down a chalkboard. By then they were freaked out. Then the
TV flickered with static and it then shut off, leaving them in the dark.</b>
<br><b>They finished this story and I had the wetest cheeks like Id been
crying for hours. They asked what was wrong and I said, I believe you.
Thats why I have these watery eyes, I get nervous.</b>
<br><b>So they said just be careful when we arent here, theres something
going on with this house. But they never told me any other stories, probably
because of my eyes watering probably made them feel that I wouldnt handle
the rest.</b>
<br><b>So the people who lived next door, were also friends. A few nights
later I asked her what ghosts she has seen. She said oh did they tell you
what happened to them recently? I said yeah, but they didnt tell me anything
else.</b>
<br><b>So she went on to tell me that after they all had different situations
they had gone to the public library and city hall for any public information
about the house. They even talked to an older lady one night who lived
near by for many years. They came up with a lot of broken stories but all
agreed that the most stories they heard was of something that happened
in the house back in the late 1920s. (the house/ neighborhood -most houses-
were builted in the early 1920s.) They were told, and she repeated this
to me, that the reason the house was the only house in the neighborhood
that was separated into apartments was because they couldnt get rid of
it to sellers.</b>
<br><b>The story was that long ago in the late 1920s, a teenage boy and
his mother lived there. The father left for military work. The boy believed
in witch craft and demons. The mother couldnt control this believe. She
was a God believeing lady and tried all the time to help her son believe
in good not evil. Without the father to help control it, it got out of
hand.&nbsp; One night the boy had murdered his mother and then took his
own life. In the basement of the home.</b>
<br><b>The basement door was in the apt. next to the one I stayed in, the
one where the girl was telling me this. She said when she moved in it was
nailed shut and painted over. They didnt even know it was a basement door
until they figured out the space between the two apartments seemed off.
The only reason they even thought of it is because of the things that go
on in her apartment.</b>
<br><b>Every night they have their nightly nail scratching up and down
the wall , where the stairs would be. It lasts about 10 minutes. Then they
have the lights flicker, the Tv turns off, then they turn it on and it
turns off etc. The water runs in the bathroom. And silverware rattles in
the kitchen drawer.</b>
<br><b>After she told me this, once again my eyes had poured out more tears
than the other days story did. I knew something really wasnt right at this
house. I was worried but I know ghosts do what they do because they are
mad, lonely, or mischevious. They dont understand what their purpose is.
So they play games.</b>
<br><b>Then I said well, what else has happened here, what are joe* and
mary* not telling me?</b>
<br><b>She said well, we got the door open to the basement. I just stared
at her and waited for what was next. She then told me they went in the
basement which was a very low ceiling dungen type michigan basement. Dirt
floors, and lots of rock formed walls, and one little window damaged, but
barely any light since it was placed under the porch in front. She said
there were wolf spiders all over, along with all other bugs and spiders
in michigan. Cetipedes and millipedes, roaches, curly bugs. Basicly your
everyday garden bug collection.</b>
<br><b>She then went on to tell me about the stuff down there, a tall dressing
mirror. Which as far as they all swear to death, cracked as soon as they
found it, all by its self, they uncovered the dust wiped it off a bit and
went to move on to the next item and the mirror cracked and shattered to
the floor. This spooked the girls who ran half back up the old rotting
steps. But the guys, they braved it out and looked through the old storage
box and the crate. In the crate was just old papers, actually dated from
1923 I think, (they did turn these into the city for obversation and preservation)
but then in the old suit case looking storage box was books and a sock
doll of some sort but dressed in a black dress, and it had no eyes. Very
old, missing arm and I think she said it was just totally showing its age
with tears and mold and the fell of wet. Then they started looking through
the books. Obviously just left in the basement because they were thought
to be just old books , the land lord who nailed the door shut later said;
when confronted with knowing something was up with the house, he said I
left them because they seemed like they belonged down there. Then he yelled
at them for breaking the door open.</b>
<br><b>Anyhow, in the pile of books, they found some that seemed to be
of witch craft studies, too ruined to read, but they made out some words
that seemed of evil use.</b>
<br><b>But then they found a journal like book.&nbsp; They couldnt read
much of it either but enough to satisfy their beliefs of the stories they
were told. One page had broken up words, making out a little, they read..."
And then I bleed, and I will live through him" . And another said " Take
her blood, and he will give you life, take your own...... " they couldnt
read anymore of that sentence. So basicly the pages that were written in
small scribbled handwriting that were readable, said really eerie things
of the sort.</b>
<br><b>(I may&nbsp; have the sentences off a bit, its been 9 years since
this went on)</b>
<br><b>So finally you ask, so wheres your actual ghost story???</b>
<br><b>Ok, so the girl spooks me, she told me all this stuff and I believed,
I dripped wet tears, I shook with chills. I then forgot about it for the
next few weeks. Never stayed at her apt. Thats for sure. I figured the
basement caused their apt. To have more activity than the one I stayed
in. Even though I was told of the kitchen ghost I still wasnt worried.</b>
<br><b>But then,, about a month or so later, my roomates were gone, like
they always were. I was alone waiting for a friend to come over after working
at a bar. I had the lights off and the TV on ( my eyes are starting to
tear as the same as every other time I tell this story). I was lying on
the couch which was directly virtical with the door. Meaning when you walk
in the door the arm to the couch is basicly right there.&nbsp; It was ,
and Ill never forget, 4:26am.</b>
<br><b>(remember the breezeway with no door, but a wind blocker peice of
wood to my left as if I were looking out the door?)</b>
<br><b>ok so 4:26am. I hear tapping. Tapping on a very thin old window
on a old door. A window hidden by only blinds. Tap, tap, tap, tap.....faster
tapping than you can read it as. But very light tapping.... Like someone
trying to be quiet.</b>
<br><b>So I look around the room first because I was reluctent to really
want to open the door, even though I was expecting someone.</b>
<br><b>But I finally got up when the tapping didnt stop.</b>
<br><b>I took my finger and lifted the blind a little bit to see who it
was.......</b>
<br><b>No one. No one was there. All I saw was the empty long front porch
with the wood to my left blocking my view to the street, but once past
the plywood was railing, then about 5 ft. past was the steps. Too far for
someone to run off after playing a joke. I looked quickly to the right
at the other door, just dark, I knew the younger girl was gone visiting
friends, and her mother and 12 year old sister were there, but they wouldnt
play games like this.</b>
<br><b>I stared out there for what seemed to be minutes. But then I got
the tears and horrible chills, like I wasnt alone. But I was alone, at
least humanly. I jumped on the couch and laid quietly just staring at the
Tv. Around 4:44am. I heard tapping again. By then I had calmed down because
a short time passed, a good 20 minutes. I thought by then without hearing
anymore tapping I was just losing my mind. So now this time it had to be
my friend finally thank goodness.</b>
<br><b>I got up and again peeked through the blinds. To my fricking unbelieveable
horror, NO ONE .... again no one was there but the tapping on the window
that was right there in my face continued harder and harder. I ran jumped
on the couch pulled the blanket over my head and just started praying.
I knew this wasnt just your everyday casper the friendly ghost, this was
a possible devil worshiper who had murdered his mother and himself. If
this was the boy he was back and really mad. He was determined to make
me open the door and I wouldnt. Then under the covers I remembered the
story of the guy walking from the wall to the kitchen, I got scared so
I jumped up still wrapped in the blanket walked to the kitchen turned on
the light, turned on the living room light, turned on the hall light, turned
up the TV. and sat hidden in a corner. The tapping went on through all
of this, but then it stopped all of a sudden. I saw a flicker in the kitchen
light, and I knew he had gotten in. I knew I was for real not alone. I
started to cry. I thought to myself the tears I get are one thing, they
are a sign of something, but this time I cried because I was fricking scared
sh****s.</b>
<br><b>All I could do was sit there in a corner by the couch. I had the
blanket around my head like a towel then wrapped around my body. I sat
there for a good 30 minutes without moving, Im not even sure I breathed.
I looked at the clock and it was 5:17. I wondered where my friend was and
why he wasnt there. He should have been there around 4:30. The bar closed
at 3 (drinking stopped at 2) so he normally got out of there around 4.</b>
<br><b>He wasnt there so I thought he was playing games with me in which
made me have good thoughts, enough to move me back to the couch. But still
wrapped in the blanket because the lights still flickered in the kitchen
on and off dull to dim to bright. I figured that wasnt my friend, but something
else. All of a sudden a knock at the door made me almost pee my pants.
I wouldnt get up to look this time. Then I heard my friend calling my name.
Still nervous, I waited. I knew he had a key but knocked out of laziness
since the only light to see in the breezeway was the light from the corner
street light. Making it hard to put your key in the door. So then I heard
him trying to open with the key. As he went to turn the door handle, the
kitchen light bulb blew out. He came in and I looked at him with fear in
my eyes. He said oh my god whats wrong are you ok, you look like you seen
a ghost.... I asked..."no pun intended right"?</b>
<br><b>He said what do you mean by that? I said I think I have been hanging
out with a ghost all night.&nbsp; I started to tell him the story but I
said well you know Ill tell you tomarrow, could you change the light bulb
in the kitchen though?</b>
<br><b>So got just 5 more minutes for the rest of the story?</b>
<br><b>The friends I stayed with came home the next day. We all sat around
and were talking about whatever. My friend who came that morning explained
he drove a co worker home and ended up playing a new video game for a few
minutes. Thats why he was late.</b>
<br><b>And as he said that my friends who lived there said, why are you
upset with im being here too late? I then told them what happened. ( the
guy took care of me like a sister)</b>
<br><b>He stood up and said "god Damn it !!! " When is this shit going
to end? " Then he looked at me and yelled... dont you ever look out that
window ever again when you hear tapping.... he then walked out the door
and slammed it behind him.</b>
<br><b>His girlfriend said, dont look out there ok. I said why whats wrong?
She said, well one night when we were watching Tv, we heard some tapping
like you. Joe* got up and looked and there was this figure of this person
there, but not really a person but a blur of a person. He said as soon
as he saw the figure, it then went flying backwards screaming of the porch
and into the air....</b>
<br><b>He couldnt sleep for days. He wants to move out but cant afford
any where else.</b>
<br><b>I once again, got chilled, and one tear rolled down my cheek. I
knew that I got lucky, I knew this ghost is evil and I needed to leave
and not stay there anymore.</b>
<br><b>I did just that.</b>
<br><b>Its Halloween soon, I love it. Happy haunting.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Friendly House Ghosts</b><b></b>

</p><p><b>By: gingermoggie@hotmail.com</b><b></b>

</p><p><b>A year or so ago my partner and I moved into a dilapidated house
in the</b>
<br><b>suburbs that needs a lot of work&nbsp; to make it comfortably habitable.
We've</b>
<br><b>always been struck by the peacefulness and benevolent feeling within
this</b>
<br><b>house, even though it had been empty for several years before we
moved in,</b>
<br><b>and was still furnished with the 1960's furniture of it's previous
owners,</b>
<br><b>an elderly couple. As I often work from home, one of the bedrooms
is set up</b>
<br><b>as a study with my computer in it. As I worked away I sometimes
got the</b>
<br><b>feeling I was being watched. I realise this is nothing new to anyone
and I</b>
<br><b>shrugged it off as being alone in a big empty house and having too
active an</b>
<br><b>imagination.</b>
<br><b>Until that is one afternoon in early October. I was working on my
computer</b>
<br><b>when I felt the distinct feeling of someone pressing their hand
to the back</b>
<br><b>of my head, right above my neck. As I was alone in the house and
absorbed in</b>
<br><b>my work, this naturally scared me and I felt the hairs rise at the
back of</b>
<br><b>my head like an electric shock had past through me. I sat stock
still for a</b>
<br><b>few moments, before phoning my partner at work to share my experience.
By</b>
<br><b>this point I was sort of laughing it off, trying to rationalise
that nothing</b>
<br><b>had happened and I was being silly. Although I know it did happen
and it was</b>
<br><b>a very distinct feeling.</b>
<br><b>A few weeks later I brought it up again with my partner, he surprised
me by</b>
<br><b>telling me of his own experience,&nbsp; a few weeks ago he had been
working in</b>
<br><b>the study late at night when he definitely felt a hand pressing
down on his</b>
<br><b>shoulder. Neither of these experiences were at all menacing, they
just</b>
<br><b>scared us for a short while because they were so unexpected. I joke
to</b>
<br><b>myself that we have "friendly house ghosts", who are pleased that
we are</b>
<br><b>re-venerating their beloved old house to it's former glory. Or maybe
it was</b>
<br><b>my father, who died a few months before this happened just passing
though</b>
<br><b>making sure we were ok.</b>
<br><b>Since that winter we've had fno more experiences of a presence around
us,</b>
<br><b>maybe they've got used to having us here? I once thought I saw a
small,</b>
<br><b>curly haired dog out of the corner of my eye, but I dismissed it
as a trick</b>
<br><b>of the light. Also, once my cat saw something that scared her stiff,
she</b>
<br><b>doubled up her body like a question mark, her hair stood up on end
and she</b>
<br><b>wouldn't let me go near her. This went on for at least&nbsp; ten
minutes, but I</b>
<br><b>could see nothing that could upset her in the empty hallway, so
I guess she</b>
<br><b>could see something I couldn't. This is a very dull story in comparison
to</b>
<br><b>others on the site, but it's nice to share.</b>

<br><b>The Lost Girl Who Drowned</b><b></b>

<p><b>By: christine_kowbuz1@hotmail.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>

</p><p><b>Since I was around eight years old I have been experiencing ghostly
phonemenom.&nbsp; I have never felt any danger or evil but nevertheless
I don't welcome my supernatural visitors.&nbsp; This past year alone (after
curiousity got the better of me) I was wandering around a semi-abandoned
19th century mental hospital and had some sad soul sighed desperately into
my ear, so close it sounded right inside it. I wasn't afraid just saddened.&nbsp;
I also live very close to a large span bridge over a highway that has attracted
many suicides.&nbsp; I get plenty of visitors in my apartment from there.&nbsp;
They just seem to be wandering around, just absently noticing me. These
spirits acknowledge my presence and accept me, it's just like I'm an invisible
witness to another, ghostly world.&nbsp; Although there was one incident
where a ghost did seek me out.</b>
<br><b>While I was growing up in my childhood home. I always heard noises
and heavy workboot footsteps walking down the hall outside the bathroom
whenever I had a bath.&nbsp; My cat still watches an invisble figure in
the house but never is afraid or nervous, she just quietly relaxes and
naps. When I was about 12 years old I was a very busy kid, always with
some craft project on the go. I had gone down the basement to look through
this bag of felt scraps for something I was sewing. I felt a little unnerved
just because it was dark and I was by myself but I continued rumaging,
eyes forward. The next few seconds happened in a daze. I suddenly had an
urge to look up as if someone was watching me. When I did there was a hazy
white grey mist around the figure of a girl about my age, silently watching
me She had long fair hair and was wearing a high-necked nightgown with
bare feet, she was pretty and kind looking. My heart almost stopped and
I must have startled her by looking up because without turning she ran
into the darkness of the laundry room and vanished. I made a choking scream
and ran upstairs. For some reason I ran to my Dad who was lying on the
couch watching TV. I grabbed his arm and pulled so hard I literally dragged
him onto the floor. I just wanted someone else to see, he of course didn't
see anyting or believe me and he thought I was nuts.&nbsp; No one but those
on my mothers side of the family believes me. They have had their own encounters
down the years. I later found something out from an elderly neighbour who
had lived on the street all her life. Our house was built in 1920 and a
young girl who lived there with her parents had drowned shortly after moving
away from the house. Was she coming back to a place that holds happy memories,
curious and wanting to play with a girl her own age?&nbsp; I also found
out a teenager whose family lived there in the 70's also drowned in an
accident. Oddly enough since seeing her, I strangley have forgotten how
to swim and hav been afraid of water ever since.</b><b></b>

<p><b>The Boots</b><b></b>

</p><p><b>By: VampsRock666666@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>This story was told to me by my uncle</b>
<br><b>he said him and his friends were about fifteen or sixteen when this
phnomanon happened. They all knew of this house that everyone said was
haunted so they decided to go and check it out for themselves. He said
they got there before dark one night and stayed there all night and nothing
happened. They went back a few more times and still nothing. The last time
they went they all were sitting in the living room part of the house. They
heard a sound as if someone was walking around up in the attic of the house.
Well this kind of shooked them up but they just shrugged it off and stayed
there alittle longer. Then they heard the sound again and this time it
was loud as if someone was running up in the attic. Then it sounded as
if the walking was coming down the stairs from the attic. They all jumped
up and grabbed what ever they could to defend themselves from what ever
was coming. They went and opened the door to the attic and there sitting
on the stairs was a pair of old cowboy boots. Everything the stairs, the
walls everything was covered in dust, but the pair of boots where perfect
and shiny. This scaried my uncle and his friends and ran from the house
and never returned again.</b>

<p><b>The Bar</b><b></b>

</p><p><b>By: etaisey@hotmail.com</b><b></b>

</p><p><b>I am a believer in all things supernatural, and while I have never
had a</b>
<br><b>concrete encounter with a ghost, this story that happened to my
brother</b>
<br><b>really freaked me out.</b>
<br><b>My brother is a military man and a skeptic, and did not believe
in ghosts</b>
<br><b>until this incident.&nbsp; Everything could be explained logically
somehow.</b>
<br><b>He was living in Monterey Peninsula on the military base (circa
2001).</b>
<br><b>Off-duty, the boys hung out in one of the common buildings, which
by night</b>
<br><b>served alcohol and had festivites and by day was sometimes used
for other</b>
<br><b>things.&nbsp; My brother would get off duty around closing time,
and often would</b>
<br><b>go over and volunteer with some of the other boys helping the staff
close up</b>
<br><b>the building and clean up, which included sweeping the floors, stacking
all</b>
<br><b>of the tables and the chairs together and pushing them up against
one wall,</b>
<br><b>turning the lights off, unplugging the jukebox, etc.</b>
<br><b>I swear I have never heard this tone in his voice as when he called
me that</b>
<br><b>night and told me what happened.&nbsp; There isn't any way he was
making this up.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; One night, they had performed the routing cleaning up and
closing down of</b>
<br><b>the bar, and my brother and two other men were just leaving the
building.</b>
<br><b>As they were all standing outside, the man with the keys went to
lock the</b>
<br><b>door, and the second he turned his key in the lock, they heard the
jukebox</b>
<br><b>come on.&nbsp; My brother said that he must have forgotten to unplug
it or</b>
<br><b>something, so they all went in to investigate.&nbsp; Bear in mind
that they had</b>
<br><b>been standing outside after leaving the bar as neat as a pin for
maybe ten</b>
<br><b>seconds.&nbsp; When they walked back inside to unplug the juke,
all of the tables</b>
<br><b>were back out on the floor with all of the chairs situated around
them, all</b>
<br><b>of the lights were back on, the floor looked like people had been
partying</b>
<br><b>all night long and was filthy, and there were half-empty drinks,
still cold,</b>
<br><b>all over all of the tables, but no one to be seen.&nbsp; My brother
said that the</b>
<br><b>three of them just stood there and stared.&nbsp; The jukebox was
playing "Champs</b>
<br><b>Elysees", IN French.&nbsp; Champs Elysees isn't even ON the jukebox.&nbsp;
My brother</b>
<br><b>went over to unplug it, and it was already unplugged and playing
by itself.</b>
<br><b>The three of them walked back outside and locked the doors and went
home,</b>
<br><b>leaving everything just the way they found it.&nbsp; My brother
said that he</b>
<br><b>didn't go back the next evening to help open, but that the man who
had the</b>
<br><b>keys and did said that when he came in, the bar looked exactly as
if they</b>
<br><b>had cleaned it on any ordinary night and left, and there was no
sign of</b>
<br><b>anything that they'd seen when they came back inside the previous
night.</b>
<br><b>Pretty spooky.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Someone is Looking After My Sister</b><b></b>

</p><p><b>By: benjamin.sweeny@rmsdas.com</b><b></b>

</p><p><b>Hi, my name is Ben, I live in Australia, in a town near Canberra.
I am a believer in the spirit world and am open to most happenings which
have occurred, to me, my family and friends. Activity usually happens around
my sister Jodie, a clairvoyant told her she had a guardian which follows
her. Apparently the spirit is a woman who is a relative of ours from many
generations ago. Her name isn&#8217;t clear, but Isabelle seems to be the name
my sister has settled on.</b>
<br><b>There was an incident that happened when I was about 13 or 14 (I&#8217;m
23 now) I was next door at a mate&#8217;s house and my sister was still living
t home, she had taken a shower at around 11am and was getting ready to
go out. When she opened the door to the bathroom, someone ran past the
door and down the hall, my sister thought it was her boyfriend at the time
and called out to him that he scared her, but there was no reply. She called
out to me and my friend as we were just in his backyard. We came straight
home, she told us what happened, and she feared that someone was in the
house, but no one was found. Eventually her boyfriend came home and said
that it wasn&#8217;t him. It wasn&#8217;t until last year that my sister visited the
aforementioned psychic when she told her and I quote &#8220;Remember the day
you had the shower, and you came out and thought it was Darren (boyfriend)
jumping across the doorway? It wasn&#8217;t him it was Isabelle, your guardian&#8221;.
That freaked her out, but relieved. That was one of the things that happened
that stands out the most, although many things have happened to her since.
Mainly things like seeing things from the corner of your eye, stuff like
that. Then there was the time a birthday balloon which was filled with
helium. You know how after a few days they tend to lose the air and start
to sort of hover? We&#8217;ll one day a friend of my sister was staying over
and was having breakfast after Jodie went to work. He looked into the dining
room after he saw a flash and his eyes settled on the balloon, which wasn&#8217;t
moving at the time but within seconds it slowly moved towards him, about
a metre (3 feet) above the ground. It had to travel about 10 metres to
get to him and then stopped, floated up about another foot to his eye level
and stopped. He just went &#8220;ooooohkay&#8221; and pushed it away. Now this next
bit may be hard to believe but it came back, circled his head 3 times and
stopped right back in front of his face. Freaked him out! He went and had
a shower and when he came out, on the other side of the door was the balloon.
It was eye level again, remember he was sitting down before, he was now
standing. He&#8217;s 6&#8221;2. He doesn&#8217;t stay there much anymore.</b>
<br><b>Before I go, something happened to me to. It was before school,
I was about 16. Mum had left for work and I was in the shower and had heard
her leave as I got out. She said good bye, I replied. It took me about
10mins to get ready, but when I went to the kitchen, an egg timer had just
been turned over on the window sill. I know no-one was home but it had
just been turned over. Now it took me 10mins to get ready and it only takes
3mins for the egg timer to finish, and mum had left about 15mins earlier.
Not very scary but interesting none the less. Thanx for taking the time
to read my story. And don&#8217;t hesitate to send your own stories in, I&#8217;d love
to hear them. Keep up the great work on this web site, it&#8217;s great. Cya!</b>
