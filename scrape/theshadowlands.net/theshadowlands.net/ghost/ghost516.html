<p class="MsoNormal">Ok I have sent stories in the past, but its been
roughly 6
years ago.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have been working in our
local McD&#8217;s for almost 4 years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have
noticed a few things but wrote them off for the most part.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I have a few so bear with me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One
night we were closed and I had already
killed the lights to the bathrooms and lobby etc.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>we
were getting ready to leave.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of my
crew had to go to the bathroom so I
asked him if he need me to turn the bathroom lights back on, he said no
and
then went to take care of his need.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not
2 minutes later he came flying from the bathroom, pale white and
shaking.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I asked him if he was ok and he
said no, he
then asked if I was sure everyone was out of the store but us closers.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I replied yeah why?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
said he was standing at the urinal and he
felt like someone was staring at him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
said when he turned around there was a little boy around 9 years old
that was
sitting by the dinks, just watching him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I looked and no one was there.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Another time, we were all closed and locked up.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>One of the girls had cleaned lobby &amp;
playland, I remember looking through the glass door into playland and
seeing a
mess on the floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I said Hey I thought
you had mopped in there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She said yeah I
just got done.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Why?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So
we both walked over and checked it
out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the middle of the floor, by the
door was a huge boot print.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nothing else
just one single print, we shrugged it off and sprayed it with cleaner.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>We then all went outside, all of us were
outside
and no one had been up front except her &amp; I.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>when
we came back in 5 mins later the boot
print was gone as well as the puddle of cleaner we sprayed on it.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>It was bone dry and as I said before none of
us were in there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was weird.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>One of my favorites was one night we were all
getting ready to leave, and we were all up at front counter clocking
out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All the doors were locked and
everybody was
right there with me, in the back of the store I heard a female giggle.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I looked around to make sure we were all
accounted for and saw that yes we were all right there &amp; then I
heard it again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There were 3 females
working that night and 1
male, no one else was in the building.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
looked around again and said hey did anyone else hear that.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Everyone of them had heard it and we all went
together to double check everything.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of
coarse nothing was found.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have since
been tapped on the shoulder, had my hair tugged and I have seen things
out of
the corner of my eye.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have also had
alarms go off when no one but me is in the building.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Its not scary at all, (Except the alarm, that
freaked me out) it just doesn&#8217;t feel right.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>All the newbie&#8217;s laugh when we talk about it but within a matter
of
weeks they approach me with stories.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
actually don&#8217;t mind.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">My New Apartment<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">By: Anonymous<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It was the year 2000, me and my two daughter&#8217;s
moved into
our first apartment on our own. The apartment is located in the Baldwin
Hills
area of Los Angeles, two bedrooms and fairly large. The apartment was
situated
at the base of a hill with an alleyway running the length of four
blocks. At
night as you look from end to end, it is very still and silent with
dull
lighting. Although I was newly divorced and my daughter&#8217;s pretty young,
we were
all excited with our new adventure. The apartment was full of light,
fun and
love :) My daughter&#8217;s shared the master bedroom in the front of the
apartment
and I the smaller bedroom in the back next to the alley. I never closed
the
doors to my daughter&#8217;s room, or mine, allowing me to hear if they
needed me. I
also either kept the bathroom or hallway light on for security incase I
had to
beat the hell out of someone breaking in. One particular night, I was
lying in
bed while my daughter&#8217;s slept. I was watching television, the volume
really low
as not to wake my children, as I talked on the phone with my sister. My
head
resting against the headboard, laughing hysterically with my sister,
the glow
of the television and the soft lighting from the hallway made for a
comfortable
setting; until something made me look towards the doorway of my
bedroom.
Standing there was a woman dressed in black. She stood at least seven
feet tall
(my door jams were seven feet high) long, slender with black shoulder
length
hair. So pale she was almost translucent, with full, almond, pitch
black eyes
(no pupils) a long bird like nose. Her arms were so long, when her
hands rested
against the door jam, arms bent, her arms seemed to run the length of
her
thighs and her elbows parallel with her knee&#8217;s; almost like a mantis. I
could
not see her feet even though her dress did not touch the floor. She
stared at
me with her head tilted in a questioning manner and a slight
smile/smirk
distorting her already unreal face. The moment I looked straight at her
eyes,
they seemed to say &#8220;I&#8217;m going to kill you now&#8221;&#8230;.I panicked!! Of course
and in a
split second I thought of my babies!! Then I heard my sister still
talking and
laughing on the phone and I began to stutter and breathlessly explain
there is
a friggin demon/ghost/dead lady in my doorway and she is gonna hurt
me!! I did
not take my eyes off of her as I hysterically explained what was
happening
(first rule of L..A. living). She was not there for more than a split
second
and then&#8230;&#8230;.gone&#8230;&#8230;nothing. All I could do is ask for my sister&#8217;s company
that
night and turn on every damn light in the house. The kids slept right
threw it,
once again L.A. you know, earthquakes and all that. Occasionally I
would dream
of her, the same woman, same dimensions, on the beach, in my closet, in
my
living room, but I refused to let her get to me. I ignored her and she
went
away eventually. I told my friends at work about her and one of them
told me to
hang the picture of my great, great grandmother. That picture is creepy
enough
to scare the devil himself. She was Native American and pretty stern
looking. I
hung the picture and no more dreams. I did not mention anything that
happened
that night to my girls until they were old enough not to freak out and
I was
surprised to find they had a few stories of their own. The only other
experience I had in the apartment was the kitchen faucet&#8217;s turning on
full
blast occasionally in early mornings. My eldest daughter has
photographs of my
granddaughter and her father playing in the living room. In the photos
there
are a phenomenal amount of orb&#8217;s; beautiful, comforting orb&#8217;s. I know
in my
heart they are guardians and they stay with us to this day where ever
we are. I
have many other stories from my family member&#8217;s that I will share with
all of
you&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;someday :)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p class="MsoNormal">My Strange Experience<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">By:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>vikkig99@yahoo.com<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">My experience spans back to the year 2000. We live
in an
apartment building that is probably not more than 30-40 years old. My
son was
about 11 or 12 at the time and he came running into my bedroom one day
saying
he seen a figure in the dining room and it scared him. I of course
didnt see
it. Then one morning while I was getting dressed for work I was bending
down to
my dresser drawer and as I rose back up I glanced in the mirror thats
attached
to my dresser and I seen in the mirror what looked like a hooded all
black
figure turn into my sons room which was directly across the hall from
mine. I
went into his room and didnt see anything. I figured my eyes were
playing
tricks on me since I had just woke up and thought maybe when I rose
back up
from the drawer that maybe my eyes werent focused right. Shortly after
this
sighting, my son became very ill with a ruptured bowel and nearly died.
To this
day, I swear that hooded all black figure was something that was coming
to take
my son. About a year later, we moved into the bigger apartment across
the hall
and I have never had any more experiences, however, my daughter in law
always
says she sees something down the hall by my bedroom door when she looks
down
that way from the living room. She said its a shadow or a figure and it
actually makes her nervous to sit in a certain area of the living room
that
allows her to see the hallway from where she sits. My dog has on many
occasions
just stared into the air and acted like he was watching something.
Needless to
say, if there is something in our apartment it appears to be harmless
as it has
never caused any noise or harm. The one thing that did scare me though
was the
all black figure that went into my sons room that morning. Thankfully,I
havent
seen it since that morning back in 2000.And my son is alive and well!<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Thanks for letting me tell my story!<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Not Welcomed in My Grandpa's Workroom after His
Death<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">By:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>rythymaxe1@comcast.net <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">When I was a young man of 27, my wife, child, and
myself had
been invited to my Grandmother's house for Thanksgiving. My Grandfather
had
passed a few months earlier, and this was the first holiday without
Grandpa
Butch. He was one of the first television repairman in Cowlitz County,
so we
had T.V.s long before any of our other friends did. In my Grandparent's
house
they traded with one of my aunts on what I called relative row, they
traded
their house my aunt so she could have the larger house &lt;---(Family
disaster), my grandfather had a room upstairs that he did all his
television
repairs in. This was his room only and was off limits to all of us
grandchildren in no uncertain terms.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After dinner that day, my two year old son had taken it upon
himself to
climb the stairs to that offlimits room. I noticed his endeavor after
he had
gotten about 1/4 of the way to the door. I called to him and ran up the
ten or
so stairs to catch him and bring him down before he fell. When I
reached him, I
felt a force eminating from the door at the top of the stairs, and it
was a
feeling of a force that did not want either of us even thinking about
going
into that room. I had never felt any feeling like this before or since
this
episode. I can't describe it in words, but it fully enveloped me with
dread,
anger, and indignation. I grabbed Scotty off the stairs and got him and
myself
as far away from that room as I could and still be in the same town. I
never
tried to go up to that room again, as my grandfather eminated his
intentions to
me that day, and I got the idea loud and clear. I talked to my mother
about it,
and she told me that a few days after Grandpa's death, my Grandmother
had awoke
at night with my Grandfather's apparition and the foot of the bed. She
reached
out to touch him, and was told by him not to try to touch him. Then, he
disappeared, and was never seen or heard from again until my encounter
with him
that day. My Grandmother passed away quite a few years after that, but
I never
went to that house again. If I wanted to visit with Grandma, I invited
her over
to my house. I will never forget the dread and anger that feeling
encompassed.
I hope my passing will be one of more joy and peace than my Grandfather
is
apparently experiencing in his next life.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I do have an experience to share.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I used to live in Stevenage, Herts, England
in a terraced house on a road called The Oundle. The houses were built
in the
1950&#8217;s<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and would have had many tenants
before us.It was our first house and we started as council tenants
before we
bought it. The events happened about 24 years ago. When we moved into
the house
we noticed that 2 of the bedroom doors had screw holes on the outside
where
bolts had been fitted, presumably to keep children in their rooms,
nothing
however happened in the house until we had our two children, the girls
were 1
and 3 years old at the time. Our youngest girl Amanda was put in the
small back
bedroom as soon as she was old enough and was fine for a while, then
she
started to have disturbed sleep and would wake up occasionally and
would need
comforting before she would go back to sleep. On one occasion she was
found
sitting up in bed crying and pointing to a corner of the room, quite
terrified,
though there was nothing there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our
other daughter had a very different experience of the house, Kerry had
a make believe
friend. She said his name was Huddy and he lived on the landing, when
we asked
her what he was like she said he was green with black teeth and nails
and was
bigger than me, I am five feet eleven, he stood up like a man but had
pointy
ears and a tail. She even drew him a few times.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We put this down to an overactive imagination.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The main experience started late one evening
sitting downstairs with my wife.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
happened to look through the doorway of the sitting room which was open
and up
the stairs, to see a small child&#8217;s face looking back at me through the
bannister rails. The stairs went up about five steps, did a sharp turn
back on
themselves before going up again to the landing, this created a small
landing
halfway up, this is where I saw the face. I looked away to call my wife
who was
in the room but when I looked back there was nothing there. I told her
what I
had seen and we quickly turned on the hall and stairway lights and went
up to
see what the girls were up to, but they were both fast asleep in their
rooms. I
will admit to being slightly disturbed by this.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It was soon after this that my Father in Law
came to stay with us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nothing else
happened for a while though the stairway often felt chilled at times,
this was
the only experience that my wife had, she frequently commented on how
cold the
middle of the stairs were. Then one night I woke up and needed to go to
the
bathroom. Now believe me I am not scared of the dark, even now in our
third
house I will still sit up late and watch horror films on my own, then
turn off
all the lights and go to bed. I opened our bedroom door, stepped out
onto the
landing and closed the door quietly behind me there was more than
enough light
coming in through the landing window to see, from the streetlights
outside. The
stairs were to my left and the bathroom door was about eight feet
straight in
front of me. I took about three steps and glanced down the stairs, the
is a
window halfway up the stairs letting in light and in the light there
was a
small boy about 2 years old sitting on the stairs in the same place I
had seen
him before, but this time he was looking up at me. His eyes were large
and dark
in a round pale face that seemed blank of expression, his clothes were
just
pale as well. I must have looked at him for a couple of seconds then I
took
three quick steps into the bathroom and bolted the door behind me. It
took a
while to stop shaking and to get to grips with what I had seen and calm
down,
do what I needed to do and open the door. As I did my Father in Law
opened his
door and stepped out to go to the bathroom, I stepped out glancing
quickly down
the stairs, nothing there, and hurried into our bedroom, closing the
door. It
took a long while to go to sleep and I slept fitfully at best.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>In the morning I told my wife and was
relieved that she believed me.. We spent a long time wondering what to
do and
in the end turned to my sister. My wife and I are not religious in any
way, but
my sister has a strong belief and we told her what had happened. She
offered to
read some prayers and to ask the presence to be at rest, we decided it
could
not hurt and agreed. A few days later she came to the house during the
day, we
made sure the children were not around and she went and sat on the step
halfway
up the stairs, she noticed it felt cold here, and read some prayers and
asked
the presence to be at rest and move on.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nothing further happened after that, we moved Amanda in with
Kerry as it
was a large room, and they used the small bedroom as a play room. Kerry
still
spoke of Huddy, but as she got older she spoke less and less of him.
When
Amanda was much older she went back into the small bedroom but was fine.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>We moved out of the house when they were in
their early teens and when safely in the new house we told them
everything.
Amanda has no memories of anything bad and Kerry really remembers
nothing of
Huddy except vague talk about him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
don&#8217;t know what I saw, whether it was my imagination or the spirit of a
young
boy, but I know I saw it as clear as day. I was scared because I knew
it could
not be there, it showed no fear or aggression towards me it just seemed
sad. I
don&#8217;t know what scared Amanda or what on earth Kerry&#8217;s &#8220;friend&#8221; was all
about,
but the bolt marks on the doors has always made me wonder if children
were abused
in the house by previous tenants. We have told a few people about this
but have
always kept the house number to ourselves and will continue to do so.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I am now 50 years old and writing this down
for the first time has put goose bumps on me.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Things I have Experienced<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">By:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>purpleropes@yahoo.com<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I don't go out of my way to provoke spirits, but I
do have a
few stories to share. I grew up in California but my first story takes
place in
a rural area of Macedonia.. My parents, my brother, and myself were
visiting
family in Macedonia and my parents wanted my brother and I to
experience our
heritage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After doing some sight seeing
one day, we decided to visit the old house my dad used to live in just
for
memory's sake. Just getting there was an adventure as we had to travel
on
overgrown roads and through the forest. The house is a large two story
made of
wood and stone (it was rectangular in shape). All around the house was
waist
high with shrubbery, weeds, and grass which made it really difficult to
actually get to the house. So as you can tell, just by looking at the
place and
the state the house was in, NO one had been here in ages. The entire
area, even
'nearby' houses (the distance between houses was very great) had been
abandoned
for many years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The house was old, it
was built in 1898 and my dad's father bought it from some widows in the
50s. I
didn't get any creepy vibes from the place, so experiencing anything
supernatural was the last thing on my mind. My dad didn't have a key to
the
place so we had to break the doorknob and enter that way--- keep in
mind that
the house belongs to my dad, so it wasn't like we were doing anything
illegal.
My dad had let some distant relatives of ours stay in the house since
no one
else was there to take care of the place. Two men and their two wives
had lived
in the house, but to this day my dad is unsure what happened to them.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>When we opened the locked doors of each room
we found that everything of theirs was left behind. There were
portraits,
family pictures, clothing, knick knacks, furniture, and beds in each of
the
bedrooms. I even found letters in envelopes that were never mailed.
Since the
inside of the house wasn't in very good condition, we decided to open
the last
room (downstairs) and head out before we lost all of our sunlight. This
is when
things got weird. My brother had a very hard time with the last door,
like it
had more locks than normal. He had to forcefully kick a few times
before it
opened and when it did, I was unfortunately the one right in the
doorway. A
large gust of very, very cold wind rushed out of that room and it even
lifted
my hair off my shoulders and made it sway. I figured there would be
some kind
of draft, but the strength was similar to wind and it was odorless. You
would
think that opening a locked room after so long would release years of
mustiness
and funk, but I remember smelling nothing. After the initial gust of
wind,
there was no draft coming from the room.. The windows of that room were
boarded
up completely so it was way dark and very hard to see anything. I could
only
make out vague shapes of furniture, boxes, barrels, and burlap bags. I
was
frozen. There was so much negativity coming from that room. I had
strange
thoughts going through my head about how the room was a nursery and a
child was
in there, and honestly it really is one giant blur to me still. The
timeframe
between my brother kicking the door open, the gust of wind, and the
fear I felt
only lasted a few moments. I remember turning on my heels and just
bolting
toward the front door to leave. All I kept saying as I left was,
"Someone
doesn't want us to get close to the child, there was a child in there,
it was a
nursery, someone is mad at us", things like that. My brother didn't
think
twice and followed me as soon as I started to run, even though he said
later
that he didn't feel anything scary- he's the 'better safe than sorry'
type.
Anyways, after we regrouped outside the house I explained what happened
and
that I had felt the presence of a child and something/someone else and
whoever
took care of the child was angry that we opened the door. My mother
looked
upset, like, really upset. I asked her what was wrong and she said to
me,
"It wasn't a child. It wasn't a child." I remember doing a double
take and being like, 'what'd you say?'. I had to press my mom to
explain what
she meant and after pressing for a bit she went on to explain that it
wasn't a
child that lived in that room, it was the mentally handicapped son of
one of
the husbands who lived there. She said the son grew up but always had
the mind
of a child and was always dependent on his parents for survival.. Up to
this
point my parents never once talked about the family that lived here so
there
was no way we could've known about the son. I returned the next day to
try (try
being the keyword here) and help the spirits move on (my dad was the
only one
brave enough to go back in the house with me), but I felt nothing in
the son's
room anymore. We still don't know what happened to the family, but I'd
like to
think that by opening the door, the spirits realized that it was time
to move
on and were free now to do so.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>My
next story is from Alcatraz. My brother, his friend, and myself went to
visit
one day and had a fun time but nothing out of the ordinary happened.
Like usual,
I wasn't even expecting to see something. At the end of the tour we
were
listening to a worker saying goodbye and talking with everyone as we
all left.
I remember standing waiting for my brother and his friend to come over
so we
could board the boat together and I suddenly felt this urge to look up.
I saw
this man in uniform standing on the very top 'balcony' above the gift
shop (I
think it was the gift shop.. I didn't pay attention when they talked
about it).
I have a hard time describing the details of the uniform, but he
definitely
wasn't a 'prisoner'. I remember the front of his coat having a single
line of
solid brass buttons down it. He also had some cloth wrapped around his
right
bicep. He was looking down on everyone/overlooking the area with his
arms
behind his back. He was transparent and completely washed in a yellow
hue like
an old faded photo and he didn't stand there for more than a few
seconds. He
turned completely around, took a few steps, and gradually faded away.
After he
disappeared I stepped backwards to see what direction he had
disappeared to and
to my surprise, he was heading in the direction of a closed door. It
was the
weirdest thing. Has anyone else seen that figure? One last story. This
happened
when I was around 16-17. My brother and I visited a family friend at
her job
one night. She worked at a nursing home. Her shift was almost done so
my
brother and I decided to just walk around to kill some time. Everyone
was
asleep and we saw the caretakers every once in awhile in the halls. We
turned
the corner toward a small hallway that led to the eating room but the
two big
doors to the room were shut. At the end of the short hallway, I saw the
distinct hand of an old person reaching from the left toward one of the
handles
of the door. This all took place in a few seconds, so let me try to
explain.
When I saw the hand, I jumped because 1) it was the last thing I was
expecting
and 2) I was a lazy teenager and I honestly didn't want to go find a
nurse to
take care of the patient that wandered out of their room. I was under
the
impression that the person was seconds from coming around the corner
but then I
saw the hand disappear just as it were about to 'grab' the handle and I
got
really confused and scared. I didn't go all the way down the hallway,
but just
enough to realize it was nothing but a solid, one-way hallway. I booked
it out
of there to the break room so fast, my brother was following close
behind. The
hand was solid, not transparent, and very pale and even at that
distance I could
see that it was very boney. Even my brother said he saw movement down
the
hallway, but got distracted from getting a good look because I jumped.
Creepy!<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Hello, I'd like to report a few of my personal
experiences
from during my childhood, when I lived in Germany (father was in the US
Army.)
1.)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mannheim, Oggersheim suburb:
Apartment towers leased by the army for US soldiers' families &#8211; 1982 I
lived on
the fifth floor of one of the towers and during the middle of the
night, I was
unable to sleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I started seeing
dustmotes forming into a solid black shadow that leaped across the
ceiling
accompanied by a loud 'grunting' sound.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Scared me so bad that I stayed under the covers all night long.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>2.) Wildflecken, Germany:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Apartment building on "C" street -
1988-1990<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I lived in a first floor
apartment build sometime before the end of WWII.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
entire base had been a secret training
camp used by Hitler/Himmler for their SS officers.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I routinely heard my name called and would
ask my parents if the had called for me - they usually said no. I heard
the
sound of rattling chains, strange shadows, and a feeling of constantly
being
watched.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Community Rec Center/Library
(Former SS Officers' Club) I frequently visited the Rec center to
either hang
out or use the library, and I regularly heard footsteps even when I was
the
only one in the area and only the librarian was around or at her desk,
and was
in the library when an instance of "book-stacking" (see Ghostbusters
I) actually took place, and I was blamed for it by the librarian,
because
nobody else had come in that day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Woods
behind the Polish Refugees' Cemetery<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Because the base had been liberated by US soldiers, they
actually used
much of it as a sort of make-shift refugee camp for displaced Polish
children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is a cemetery in an
isolated corner of the base surrounded by woods. On a school hiking
trip
(Volksmarch) one of the female students in my elementary school
stumbled across
a partial human skeleton along with a complete spine.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thanks!<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Osgood Indiana, I lived with my family on Buckeye
Street
from 1969-1972. I was 4-5 years of age when we lived there. I am 45 now
and
have not had a day go by without remembering this place. Being so young
I did
not realize at the time what I was actually experiencing. The day we
were
moving in, I and my brother saw two shadow people in one of the
bedrooms.
Another time, I saw in my bedroom, a boy and a girl standing beside my
bed.
They were not much older than me. And they were not completely solid
(faded or
almost see-through)The girl was talking to me very low, but I could not
understand what she was saying to me. I also received 3 scratch marks
on my arm
like from fingernails scratching down my arm. They were bloody scratch
marks. I
went to my mom's room and showed my mom and she said I probably did
that to
myself and don't remember. But then she began experiencing things. One
day when
the other kids were at school I was home with my mom and the neighbor
lady was
visiting. They heard a female screaming in the house. She ran upstairs
to see
if It was me and she found me asleep. Another time, she and I was in
the
basement doing the laundry and she grabbed me and ran upstairs. She
said that
'something' was down there moving stuff. It wasn't until I was an adult
that I
understood what happened to us in that house. I heard, in 2006,<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>another person's story of being physically
attacked by a ghost and when he showed the pictures of his back with
the 3
bloody scratches, it hit me like a ton of bricks. I began putting all
the
incidents together and realized this house was haunted. I drove back to
Osgood
to see the house and it was gone. I have begun to do a historical
research on
the house. The most recent owner of the house tore it down 2 years
after he
purchased it and has left the land vacant since.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I work in a cultural centre on First Nations
territory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One evening last month I was
hosting one of
our family tree meetings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was a small
group of five women and myself. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>About
8:30 we were packing things up for the night.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We were just standing around chatting about this and that.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>We had been speaking earlier about the the
spirit that seems to live in the building the cultural centre is
located
in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A community Elder mentioned that she
has always felt uncomfortable in the building.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She said the spirit that was in the building knew who she was
but she
didn't know who the spirit was.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her
daughter and I were standing and shatting and I saw someone walk by the
inside
door. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>I kind of relled my eyes and
said"geez, I just saw someone walk by the door there.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They must have come in to use the
bathroom"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The woman I was speaking
with said"oooh, all the hair on my neck just stood up".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We went out into the hallway to let the person
know we were about to lock up for the night.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We were the only ones in the building.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>All the other doors were locked and the security alarms had been
set.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When we got to the hallway we both
heard
someone walking down the stairs to the lower part of the building. I
laughed
and said "I'm glad it was a real person".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
called down the stairs "hello?' , no
reply.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I called down again with the same
results.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It's pretty unusual for someone
to come in and go down stairs to use the washroom as there are a men's
room and
a women's room on the main floor right outside the cultural centre.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I said " I'm going down to tell them
they have to leave so we can lock up"<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I went down the stairs, checked the men's room, it was empty.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I checked the women's room, it too was
empty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I checked the only other unlocked
door down there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was no one
there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All the other doors were locked
when I checked them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The door leading
outside was still locked because the alarm would have sounded if it had
been
opened.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I called the maintenance man
to
come in and take a look in case someone had entered one of the other
offices.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He checked everywhere while we
waited at the top of the stairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There
is only one set of stairs and no one came up while we were waiting
there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The maintenance man couldn't find
anyone
either.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I guess who ever it is just
wanted to make himself known.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We weren't
frightened by the thought of a spirit but rather by the thought of
someone
hiding in the building.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Haven't seen or
heard him again for a couple of weeks.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I want to share my experience, i seen a spirit of
a young
male sitting out front of Gator Docside in Gainesville fl. I was
sitting out
front of the restaurant, and I felt something coming towards me, I turn
and
look , I saw what to seem to be a ghost of a male but only part of him
was in
physical form the other hafe was energy form. He came up to me very
fast and
went right through me, the whole thing lasted about a min. He was
wearing
bluejean shorts, he had hair on his legs like a male and was wearing
black
shoes. He look like he recently pass. Another a experience I had, I was
taking
my kids to school and I stop at a Jiffy store in Williston fl. The
store was
right by a church. I pull up in front of the store closes to the church
parking
lot, my kids ran in the store and I stay in the car, something caught
my
eye<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I look and on top of the roof of the
church I saw a ghostly figure walking across the roof coming towards
the corner
close to me and sit down at the corner of the roof, like they were
looking at
me too. It look like a liquid ether form but it was outline like a
person and
walking like s person. I did not tell my kids I did not want to scare
them. I
won't forget it.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Spirit Encounters at Basic Training at Ft. Sill, OK<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">By:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anonymous<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">My name is Michael, in 2001 I attended basic
training in Ft.
Sill, OK, and I had never seen a ghost or a spirit before this time.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>About three weeks into training me and a
fellow soldier were pulling the final fire guard of the night.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>When u do<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>this two soldiers are always awake keeping count of the number
of
soldiers sleeping in bunk, who might be up at the bathroom at the time
and anything
else out of the ordinary so you could give an accurate head count to
the drill
sergeant if he asks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During the last
fire guard shift before you wake up it your responsibility to have the
bathroom
clean and ready for inspection.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During
these last two hours mother nature better be calling like never before
if u use
the bathroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The area where we would
sleep is huge, big enough for I know there was over sixty of us, and
the bunks
were laid out in four rows with two walk ways that lead into the
bathroom at
the back of the room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The other soldier
and I were walking on opposite sides of the bay(sleeping/living area)
counting
the number of soldiers in their bunks sleeping. We came to the end and
walked
into the bathroom from opposite ends.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The bathroom doors are every bit of fifty feet apart so we were
not
talking together or anything except making sure everyone was accounted
for.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We entered the bathroom at the same
time and when we did we both seen a soldier in pt shorts and shirt,
which is
the proper sleeping attire, go into a toilet stall. Simultaneously we
called
out wanting to know why he was going in there.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I think we had half hour till inspection and surely he could
wait we had
just finished cleaning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When we
approached the stall there wasn't another living person in that
bathroom but
he<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and I.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If
I had been alone I probably would have
figured I was seeing things but we both seen the same thing at the
exact same
time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It wasn't scary and I dont
remember being cold or anything weird.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Another time after that I was on guard and when I was doing my
head
count I swear someone was standing at the end of his bunk at attention
as if
waiting for bunk inspection. I seen this out of the corner of my eye as
i
passed and when I looked back there was nobody there.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I was alone that time and might have been
that I was just sleepy, I was pulling the middle of the night guard and
had
just woke up, but I really dont think so.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The soldier I seen standing there was dressed the same as the
one I seen
in the bathroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Those were my only
encounters I had and have not had one since.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I'm just curious if you have ever heard similar stories, cause I
know
that soldiers have died during training, its rare and tragic.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I also never felt like I had anything to fear
from them, if they were ghost or spirits I believe they are just souls
that
might be stuck having had their lives end before their time.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>They were my fellow soldiers, still training
to protect our country that will never see a graduation ceremony.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Thank you for taking the time to read this I
know my punctuation is horrible and I lack storytelling skills but if
you have
ever heard of similar stories I would appreciate it if you could
possibly let
me know.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thanks again. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">By:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>torino1975@verizon.net<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I have sent in a couple of instances that have
made me stop
and say &#8220;WHOA!&#8221; and smile&#8230;except for the lengthy one I sent in a long,
long
time ago when I was a child growing up.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But I digress&#8230;this is my latest happening that makes me grin and
say &#8220;I
am not going crazy!&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Awhile back I sent
in that about 4 years ago, my husband was sitting downstairs in the den
watching TV when he happened to look up at the door (it has a solid
bottom with
9 panes of glass on top) and saw a man standing there under the yellow
bug
light.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He yelled at me (I was in the
next room) that someone was at the back door and before he could get up
to
answer it, he suspected the man was going around the front to knock
there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Beings at the time we had 3 large
Mastiffs
and 2 small Pugs (they make an awful lot of racket when they all decide
to get
excited and bark all at once) I ran up to the ground level to open the
door
before this man could knock.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I opened
the door, and no one was there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So I
walked out, no one was in the front yard. I walked to the side yard to
where
you can see the entire front/side/ and back yard and there was no one
there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rest of the property is
fenced in by a privacy fence so there was no way someone could have
been at the
back door and &#8220;vanished&#8221; without someone seeing them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It has been a running joke now and then
if/when something happens we always say &#8220;Well, maybe it is The Man.&#8221;
This past
Christmas we had 12 people and 4 dogs in this house. Yes, it was
rocking off
its foundation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But anyway&#8230;my brother<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>was put downstairs in the den so he could
have privacy&#8230;his own bathroom and go outside for a smoke if he felt
like
it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the third night down there&#8230;he got
up around 3:30 AM to use the bathroom.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Beings no one was up at that hour&#8230;he didn&#8217;t close the bathroom
door all
the way.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He stood there doing his thing
with the door slightly closed behind him to his left when he said all
of a
sudden he heard this little girl&#8217;s voice say &#8220;Oh, wow!<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hi!&#8221; and he panicked, thinking it was my 7
year old granddaughter, took his left foot and slammed the door closed
hard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He said sharply, &#8220;I am in here,
I&#8217;ll<span style="">&nbsp; </span>be out in a moment.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He said he finished, washed his hands, and
went to look for her to apologize for being so short with her.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>He finally realized NO ONE was up but him. He
said it scared him so much he went upstairs, grabbed a mug of hot
coffee and
sat in the living room with the TV on until we all got up at 8 AM.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I was cooking breakfast when he sidled up to
me with a funny smile on his face and said &#8220;Did you know your
downstairs is
haunted?&#8221; and proceeded to tell me what happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
nodded and said &#8220;Yes,&#8221; and told him about
&#8220;the Man&#8221;.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My mum got all upset and told
us to stop talking about it, it unnerved her terribly.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>BUT&#8230;I run an in-home daycare and I have a
little girl in my care (since she was 2 months old and she is now 4)
and she
just now started using that bathroom because before she&#8217;d kick and cry
&#8220;No&#8230;that
man always watches me!&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Imagine a 4 year
old 40+ pounds sitting on a tiny potty chair&#8230;you better believe I
finally made
her go and use that bathroom!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her younger
sister once in awhile says &#8220;I saw my friend&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>when she uses the bathroom&#8230;so I can only assume she has seen
&#8220;the Girl&#8221;
too.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Christmas Day when my brother told
me of his experience, I again went next door to my neighbor whose house
was the
second house built in this development and asked if anyone had died in
this
home, and she said no.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I told her about
my brother&#8217;s experience earlier that day and she said the only man who
fit the
description of The Man was the father of the woman who had my house
build&#8230;.he
always stayed at the house when his daughter had to travel for business
because
her husband was a mean drunk and he was always drunk.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They had a 5 year old daughter who was a
normal, happy, squealing, laughing little girl.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My neighbor told me more than once her husband and her witnessed
the
husband being drunk and cursing, using foul language and throwing empty
beer
bottles at his little girl.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She mused &#8220;I
don&#8217;t know if the little girl has passed as I know her mother and
father went
on to have twin boys after they moved from your house&#8230;I know her father
passed&#8230;.the description you give of The Man you see now and then<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>sounds like her father&#8230;but I have no clue who
the little girl is.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I hope nothing bad
happened to her.&#8221; So there you have it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Another person besides my husband, me, and a couple of daycare
kids have
witnessed &#8220;something strange&#8221; in this house.<o:p></o:p></p>
