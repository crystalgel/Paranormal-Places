<p><b>Two Ghost Stories</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: glassysurfash@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Two ghost experiences - one takes place late 70s, other takes place
right now...</b>
<br><b>Okay, so this is true as much as I can make of it, the story didn't
really happen to me personally, but my mother and her family - and I'm
going to try and explain it in as much detail it was explained to me.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; When my mother was a teenager, I guess around fifteen/sixteen,
her family moved into a small house here in Edinburgh (it actually is right
across the street from where we live now and my uncle still lives there).&nbsp;
In the house, there lived my mother, her three brothers, and her four sisters,
including her mother and father.&nbsp; The neighbourhood was a pretty tight
community, the kind where everyone knows everyones business - the locals
told my grandparents that the last owners of the house were an elderly
couple known as Mr. and Mrs. Ambrose.&nbsp; The story was that Mr. and
Mrs. Ambrose went on vacation to somewhere in Spain, and whilst there,
Mr. Ambrose took a heartattack and died there.&nbsp; Mrs. Amrbose came
back to Edinburgh in Scotland, and she moved out of the house - which brings
us up to date where my Grandparents bought it and moved in.&nbsp; Now for
the story...</b>
<br><b>The first incident that really happened was my Grandmother was sitting
in the living room watching TV one night and someone passed right by her.&nbsp;
Well at first she didn't really think anything of it.&nbsp; She lived in
a house with eight children, and most of them were almost grown up at this
point and whoever had passed her had been an adult.&nbsp; However, she
discovered about twenty minutes later she was the only one in the house,
and had been for over three hours.&nbsp; Months later, my Grandmother found
herself walking in the small hallway and someone passed right by her, again,
like before she didn't think of anything of it, except she turned to say
something to whoever had passed her and there was no one there...</b>
<br><b>Things transgressed.&nbsp; At the age of seventeen my mother started
going out with my father, and he would stay over at the house, one night
they were lying in bed asleep and my mum woke up and the bed was shaking
violently, she couldn't move, she finally found the strength to lean over
and she discovered the bed was hovering about a foot in the air.&nbsp;
She freaked out and started screaming and shaking my dad, but nothing would
wake him.&nbsp; There were various other incidents like things moving around
on their own, voices in the middle of the night, a sense of foreboding,
especially in the back room.&nbsp; The only thing my mother and her family
could ever assume about the ghost was that it was Mr. Ambrose had come
back and was looking for his wife...either that or he was just a really
upset ghost.</b>
<br><b>This one is more recent, it's been happening to me lately.&nbsp;
I've had a few various ghost experiences, but nothing really worth reporting
before.&nbsp; Lately, this stuff all just started happening...&nbsp; One
night, I was reading in my room, I fell asleep with the light on, and I
sort of hovered into being awake, facing the closet door - a sweater a
friend had loaned me was hanging off the door knob and I saw the material
move and shimmer (whenever it moves it kind of glitters) and the shape
of a hand gripping the front half of the top through the material was quite
visable, I was terrified.&nbsp; I lay there, I did not sleep again that
night.</b>
<br><b>Last week, I fell asleep at about three in the morning, I woke up
and the large "men in black" poster I have on one of my walls had been
taken down and rolled up...and the six pins that had been holding it to
the wall were lined up on the window sill - the weird thing is I lock my
room from the inside and it's a latch lock which can't be unlocked from
the outside period.&nbsp; I was freaked out.&nbsp; Every time I come into
my room these days I find the same piece of paper in my room laying down
on the floor face down - the paper has the lyrics to "Angel" by Sarah McLachlan
and it's the only piece of paper the ghost keeps tearing down from my pinboard
and throwing to the floor - out of 40 other things it could tear from that
pinboard, its always the page with "Angel" on it.&nbsp; Sometimes also
I wake up in the middle of the night and feel something heavy laying on
my feet - like my dog used to do before she died in January.&nbsp; So far
the ghost hasn't really hurt me, but I don't know if it intends to.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Maryland Moans</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Ickiris66@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In June on 99 me and my ex girlfriend
went to a house in</b>
<br><b>Maryland. We Had to park where the road ends duck under a gate and
walk the</b>
<br><b>path that takes about 25 min till you just reach the yard of the
house, the</b>
<br><b>path is coveted in trees so its all most like a tunnel. When you
reach the</b>
<br><b>yard you'll start to come across cold spots, me and my ex being
the ghost</b>
<br><b>hunters we are knew what this ment. the path in the yard is also
covered in</b>
<br><b>bushes and over growth from the many years of neglect, so being
able to see 5</b>
<br><b>feet in front of you is out of the question, thank God for flash
lights. We</b>
<br><b>approach the house, now mind you this house hasn't been touched
in at least</b>
<br><b>60 years its been abandoned for this long, we walked in side, checking
out</b>
<br><b>the down stairs, nothing exciting so we proceed towards the basement
when we</b>
<br><b>heard walking on the top floor, we decided to skip the basement
and find out</b>
<br><b>who or what was up stairs. The way the second floor was set up,
stairs take</b>
<br><b>you to a hall where you can the go right or left, all the doors
are shut on</b>
<br><b>the top floor. We make a right and head to the end of the hall opening
all</b>
<br><b>the door, checking all rooms and closing the doors when were done.
We mad it</b>
<br><b>to the bathroom at the end of the hall when we heard a door shut
behind us,</b>
<br><b>It turned us around to proceed to the other end of the hall. passing
the step</b>
<br><b>we came to 2 rooms, one on the right one on the left. I took the
room on the</b>
<br><b>left, when I put my foot in the room I heard crying (very faint)
all the</b>
<br><b>sudden sheet rock and floor debree started flying and a terrible
scratching</b>
<br><b>noise came from the walls, I jumped out of the room pulling my girlfriend
in</b>
<br><b>to the room to the right. Standing there frantic and scared with
our feet</b>
<br><b>pressed on the door, she started gagging, complain of a putrid smell
which i</b>
<br><b>didn't smell at all, then when she said it was gone i started to
smell it and</b>
<br><b>gagged it was the smell of a decomposing body. i tryed to kick the
window</b>
<br><b>open to no avail, on the count of 3 we both swung open the door
leaped down</b>
<br><b>the stairs, ran out the front door, havent returned to the house
sence. i</b>
<br><b>know what ever i encountered was not happy with me being there</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fort Howard Baltimore, MD, went camping
with some friends for the BWC</b>
<br><b>Baltimore war-gaming club, I was down by the dungeons when I saw
a figure</b>
<br><b>(the torso) about 100 yards from me, it swayed side to side before

<br><b>He Didn't Believe</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: csmith258@juno.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm a 34 year old mother of two and I grew
up in Los Angeles</b>
<br><b>California. When I was 4 years old my parents lived in a brightly
colored</b>
<br><b>pink house with white trim near the LAX airport. The house was bought</b>
<br><b>by the airport a few years later and it was demolished due to the
LAX</b>
<br><b>airport expansion.&nbsp; The story as my father tells it goes like
this:</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1971, we looked at a lot of houses and we fell
in love with this one!</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;The old man and woman we were buying from had owned the house</b>
<br><b>since 1945 when it was brand new. The old woman loved the house</b>
<br><b>dearly and didn't want to sell, but the old man said due to the
financial</b>
<br><b>constraints of retirement it just wasn't feasible to keep the house
any</b>
<br><b>longer. The old woman put up a mighty big fuss but the old man won</b>
<br><b>out and now we had our first home as a married couple. Some months</b>
<br><b>later the old man wrote us a letter telling us that his wife was
so</b>
<br><b>saddened by the loss of the house that after they moved she slipped
into</b>
<br><b>a depression and had passed away quietly in her sleep. We felt bad</b>
<br><b>for the old woman because we had grown to love the house just as</b>
<br><b>much as she had. My wife and I joked about the old woman possibly</b>
<br><b>coming back to stay with us in the afterlife because of her love</b>
<br><b>for the house. A few weeks after the letter came strange things
began</b>
<br><b>occurring around the house.&nbsp; In the middle of the night I would
be</b>
<br><b>wakened by the sound of a basketball bouncing around in side the</b>
<br><b>garage, I would get up and go out to the garage and find nothing
out of</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;the ordinary, as soon as I slipped back into bed the noise</b>
<br><b>began again.&nbsp; This continued on throughout the night and I
brought</b>
<br><b>the basketball inside the house and the noise still continued? How</b>
<br><b>can a basketball make a sound in the garage when its on the floor</b>
<br><b>in my bedroom? I was seriously disturbed by all this! This little</b>
<br><b>game continued for weeks and I wasn't getting any sleep at night</b>
<br><b>so I finally decided to turn the garage into a spare bedroom!&nbsp;
I</b>
<br><b>layed carpet&nbsp; and put in some furniture. The noise stopped!</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since she couldn't annoy us via the
garage any more she began</b>
<br><b>finding other creative ways to do her bidding.&nbsp; When my wife
or I</b>
<br><b>took our showers she would slowly turn the hot water up until it</b>
<br><b>was scalding hot! You could watch the knobs literally turn</b>
<br><b>by themselves!! I can tell you it scared the willies out of us!
It got</b>
<br><b>to a point where we didn't want to shower any more! We were</b>
<br><b>going to our in-laws to shower, and the in-laws thought we were</b>
<br><b>crazy!&nbsp; We would watch television and she would change the</b>
<br><b>channels and move the rabbit ears in different directions so the</b>
<br><b>channels were always fuzzy, she would open doors and close</b>
<br><b>windows, and sometimes when we walked into a room it would</b>
<br><b>be very cold, a bizarre kind of cold that sent shivers up your spine!</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My wife and I were completely frustrated
and exhausted,</b>
<br><b>we were open to any ideas, then we received word that the airport</b>
<br><b>was buying up houses in the neighborhood so we took the offer</b>
<br><b>and bought another house 5 blocks away.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
That's the story: My dad never believed in</b>
<br><b>ghosts, but after that experience he's not so sure anymore. He can't</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;give any simple explanation to the odd things that happened
and</b>
<br><b>he'll never forget how terrified he felt!</b><b></b>

<p><b>A Dark Message</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: lepracon@rochester.rr.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>this story was told to me by my mother and grandmother when i was
younger.</b>
<br><b>This incident took place when my mother was between eight and nine
years</b>
<br><b>old,back in the 40's sometime. my mother was in bed with her two
other</b>
<br><b>sisters late at night sleeping, when she awoke to see a black figure</b>
<br><b>standing next to her by the bed. she was so frightened , she screamed
for</b>
<br><b>her mother to come to her room,and that someone was near her bed.
her mother</b>
<br><b>ran to her room with a broom, and told the "figure" to leave her
daughter's</b>
<br><b>room because it was scaring her. her mother chased it down the stairs</b>
<br><b>through the house and "through" the back door of the kitchen. i
say through</b>
<br><b>because my grandmother said that it did not open the door to run
out, but it</b>
<br><b>went through the door and disappeared. within that week, my mother
fell ill.</b>
<br><b>she was diagnosed with rheumatic fever, and was laid up in bed for
a year. i</b>
<br><b>also would like to say that a similar experience happened to my</b>
<br><b>grandmother's brother. he fell ill and was diagnosed with polio
shortly</b>
<br><b>after his experience. thank you for having this page.</b><b></b>

<p><b>A Few Odd Experiences</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: asulliv2@rochester.rr.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have spent hours reading everyone's encounters, and I must say
I am impressed with the many common themes that arise over and over. I
too, have had a few odd experiences, but I always chalked them up to my
imagination. Now that I have read the stories on this site, I am not so
sure. Although my experiences are mild, I feel inclined to share them now.</b>
<br><b>The first thing I remember is a feeling. We lived in a very old
farmhouse in upstate NY. My family moved in when I was two, and I remember
when my parents put me to bed at night I would hear someone walking down
the hall outside my room. I always thought that the house was so old that
it just creaked a lot. I also used to get a strange feeling at bedtime.
I could never go to sleep because I felt like if I rolled on my side that
someone was behind me watching. I acquired about seventeen stuffed animals
(I was about seven at the time) and started lining them up along my back
at bedtime. This gave me the feeling that I was safe, and I would go to
sleep. I used to think that eventually I just out grew this silly fear,
but when I started reading this site, I realized that my ability to fall
asleep without the stuffed animals developed after we moved out of that
house. Once I settled into my new house for a few months, I got rid of
the stuffed animals (I was eleven by then.) The only other thing that happened
in that house was once I woke up from a bad dream to find a little midget
on my dresser. He was mean, and there were little things flying around
his head (kind of like little tinker bells.) I was terrified and felt very
sick. One of the little things floating around asked, "What should we do
with her?" and the little midget said, "lets kill her!" I was terrified
and was sure it was real. I hid under the covers and cried and the next
morning I was still very upset, but was sure that I must have been hallucinating
from illness. I only question it now because of some of the stories I have
read on this site, and the fact that I am not prone to fevers. I could
be close to death and never get a fever. I am now thirty four, and still
don't spike a fever higher than 99 degrees. I mention this because I have
never known illness to cause hallucinations unless there is a high fever.
That night the only thing I had was a terrible stomach ache. I also have
a vague memory of being terrified by something in that room when I was
much younger-what I can't say-but I remember going out so sleep in the
hall because I just couldn't stay in that room anymore. My parents have
a picture of me curled up sleeping in the hall that night.</b>
<br><b>Things were quiet until I married and moved into our first house
with my boys and husband. This house was built in 1914 and was owned by
one family until we bought it from the daughters of the people that died
while living there.</b>
<br><b>While I was there cleaning before we moved in, I kept feeling like
someone was there. Forgetting that I was alone, I would turn to talk to
my husband, and of course there would be no answer. I mostly felt the presence
while I stood at the kitchen sink. I kept thinking someone was standing
behind me. I never mentioned this feeling to my husband, and on the day
we moved everything in, he was setting up the television for the boys,
and started flipping out that something cold had rubbed the back of his
leg (he was wearing shorts.)</b>
<br><b>Three months after we moved in, the woman that rented the upstairs
from us moved out because we raised the rent.</b>
<br><b>It took us a couple of months to rent it again, so it was empty
for two months. One day I was home sick from work by myself. All of the
sudden right over me in the upstairs kitchen I heard kitchen chairs pulling
away from a table like several people were getting up to leave. It took
me about ten seconds to realize that not only did no one live up there,
but there was also no kitchen table or chairs up there! I was really freaked
out.</b>
<br><b>Once we finally rented the apartment, I forgot about the kitchen
thing, but often wondered if I was crazy because I noticed two types of
foot steps upstairs. This was strange because the apartment was rented
by a very quiet woman with VERY few visitors. I thought that she had a
boyfriend for a while, but she didn't. Anyway, one night my husband and
I were in bed at about ten thirty at night. As a couple will occasionally
do, we decided to take advantage of our time alone. When we were done,
we heard someone get up from the couch upstairs (her living room was right
over our bedroom) and walk to the kitchen. My husband and I both snickered
and made little comments about her hearing our goings on moments before.
We then heard the foot steps return to the living room and stop where they
started-right over us. We both decided that since she had been right over
us, she could have heard our intimate moment. Except that about fifteen
minutes later, we heard her come home! I opened our door and asked her
if anyone was staying with her, and she said no. Needless to say, she thought
we were a little nuts (perhaps on drugs) because we were stopping her at
eleven at night to question her guest status!</b>
<br><b>After that I noticed the difference in her footsteps verses the
heavier man like steps I would hear on occasion. Also, I would hear a rocking
chair creaking the floor in the afternoons. I have a friend that can "feel"
a presence and has claimed to see many&nbsp; a vision, and she admitted
to me that she never liked that upstairs. Eventually our tenant moved out
and we opened the whole house up. She went up there once, but didn't want
to stay. The attic made her even more uncomfortable. My son often claimed
to see a man in his room at night. But you know how we disregard kids.....We
moved out a year and a half ago, and all is quiet for now.</b>
<br><b>Sometime I will tell you about my nieces house. Until then, thanks
for listening and creating such a cool website. Now I can truly believe
that what I have experienced is not my crazy brain but something real.</b><b></b>

<p><b>A GHost Tried to Get Me!</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:mcpcert2000s@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I was around 5 years old. My family moved into a house</b>
<br><b>built during the Colonial days and alot of strange</b>
<br><b>things were happening. These would happen in front of</b>
<br><b>other people and when there was no one around. Small</b>
<br><b>things at first. The stove kept turning on by itself.</b>
<br><b>Then one day it blew up. My older brother recalls</b>
<br><b>seeing shadows everywhere. Then the normal stuff,</b>
<br><b>lights going on, footsteps ...etc, etc. But two</b>
<br><b>incidents have stuck with me. First, I was laying bed</b>
<br><b>and my brother was in the room with me. He looked up</b>
<br><b>to the window and saw a face, lizard-like in</b>
<br><b>appearance. I began crying, I was a deaf child, so I</b>
<br><b>wasn't able speak to well. I started yelling things,</b>
<br><b>but my mother couldn't make out what I saying, so she</b>
<br><b>didn't investigate. My brother has a better</b>
<br><b>recollection of this than I do. he says he noticed</b>
<br><b>that the moon in the background was very small. The</b>
<br><b>face floated away, and the moon got bigger. Then the</b>
<br><b>second thing is what happened to me. This I do</b>
<br><b>remember. The garage was apart from the house. The</b>
<br><b>doors where on a track and rolled to the sides. one</b>
<br><b>day I was out playing on a toy that I had A little</b>
<br><b>down the driveway, but not at all in the way of the</b>
<br><b>door. The driveway itself comes up on the side of the</b>
<br><b>garage and and curves to the right to meet up with the</b>
<br><b>garage doors. I was in the driveway and the door</b>
<br><b>nearest me jumped off the track, did a 90 degree turn</b>
<br><b>and fell on me. I remember this, and my grandmother</b>
<br><b>was witness to this. The door actually jumped free of</b>
<br><b>the track, TURNED 90 degrees, then fell. I have</b>
<br><b>pictures to this day of how badly I was hurt. My</b>
<br><b>family actually did move out later because of these</b>
<br><b>hauntings.</b><b></b>

<br><b>A Haunting</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: suzij@bellsouth.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have an old farmhouse in Okla that was purchased by my father from
a catholic church in a nearby town and moved onto the property in about
1972.&nbsp; The house was used as the rectory.</b>
<br><b>The first time I set foot in the house was before it was moved and
I 'bout ran over my dad getting out again. I could feel a chilling presence
in the heat of a mid August afternoon.&nbsp; My father passed away on the
property (not in the house) in 1977.&nbsp; My mother lived in the house
until apprx 1993 when she was moved to a nursing home.&nbsp; My father
in law lived in the house until 1998 when he took his own life in the house.&nbsp;
It was 2 weeks before his body was found.</b>
<br><b>Currently, my cousin and her adult daughter are living in the house.</b>
<br><b>Earlier this month, my daughter, her husband and two children met
me at "the farm" for the family reunion.&nbsp; Photo's were taken in the
house of the kids at various times.&nbsp; In each picture that was taken
inside the house there is a white blob that blocks out a good bit of the
photo.&nbsp; Of the photo's of the kids...not one turned out.&nbsp; The
presence blocks out that portion of the picture that would be the kid.&nbsp;
The roll of film was started here in Georgia, middle part was in the house,
end was at the local cemetary.&nbsp; All photo's are fine except the ones
inside the house.</b>
<br><b>During the years, people who have been in the house have commented
on it being "haunted".</b><b></b>

<br><b>A House Warming and Distressed Spirits</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: JayMack@cfl.rr.com]</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hi my name is Jay and this is a small story about my mothers house
in Upstate Central Camden New York.&nbsp; As a school kid I use to walk
to school with my borther and a few friends, we always use to remark about
this certain house on our way to school and say it was haunted.&nbsp; When
I turned 17 my mother and step-father bought the house(imagine my surprise)
Now mind you I have been really into the subject of ghosts for a very long
time and this was my first experience with them.&nbsp; Just after we moved
into the house I was putting things away late one nite, went to bed and
woke up to find everything I put away stacked neatly next to my bed.&nbsp;
This went on for a whole weekend with the same objects.&nbsp; A few years
down the road, U had just gotten out of work, went to a friends house and
baby sat for them for a few hrs, came home and went to bed.&nbsp; While
trying to get to sleep wearing headphones plugged into a cd player I heard
them.&nbsp; I could hear them walking up and down the staircase from the
wood room to the attic, the house was built in 1827 and there hadn't been
stairs there for well over a hundred years.&nbsp; I could also hear the
dog(s) pacing around and walking in the wood room, we had one dog and he
was next to my bed.&nbsp; I also could hear the music and conversation.&nbsp;
It was really an amazing experience.&nbsp; I have told my mother that story
for about 10 years now and it wasnt until a year ago when she finally asked
me if her house is haunted, of course I told her yes and relayed my story
yet again.&nbsp; She told me that explained alot over the years.&nbsp;
Thats when se finally told me about the typical haunting activities, lights
on and off when no one is home or in that room, or even when someone is
in that room the lights will go on and off, cold spots on occassion, and
the feeling of relaxeness and friendliness and comfort coming from the
home itself.&nbsp; Just recently my mother and step dad have been talking
about moving after retirement in four years, I guess the other residents
arent too happy with that.&nbsp; Seems as though that while everyone was
at work they took the mirrir off of my mothers vanity dresser ( I can personally
vouche that that mirror is heavy lol) and the knocked a door half way off
its hinges on the cupboard hutch.&nbsp; All is well in the house right
now, I talked my mom through a conversation with them having her explain
to them what is going on and that she didnt mean to upset them.&nbsp; LOL
it was kinda difficult but fun trying to talk a non pagan person through
such a thing.&nbsp; Good thing she is very open minded :)&nbsp; I have
2 other ghost tales to tell one in Delaware, and one in Florida, all places
I have lived or currently live.&nbsp; I will share these another time as
it is late and I have to work in the am :)&nbsp; Thanx for listening and
keep up the excellent work on the site :-)</b>

<br><b>Adrian</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Lydia.Cisneros@asapconsultants.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>I really hope you use this story since it is true. Maybe it can help</b>
<br><b>someone.</b><b></b>
<p><b>My story starts in 1994. I was pregnant with my 7th child ( though
I didnt</b>
<br><b>know it) I had had 6 girls already there ages ranging from 11 to
3 yrs old.</b>
<br><b>My whole family is mainly made up of mostly women so when I had
Adrian my</b>
<br><b>family was just estatic over him there waws always someone ther
to hold him,</b>
<br><b>feed him, change him basiclly he has it made and loved every minute
of it.</b>
<br><b>He was the kind of baby that was so quite and hardly ever cried
you forgot</b>
<br><b>he was there.&nbsp; Well this early spring morning I was feeling
sick which we</b>
<br><b>thought at the time was me getting over a real bad kidney infection(
It</b>
<br><b>wasnt) My husband had told me to get the kids ready and we would
go out to</b>
<br><b>eat breakfast. So Irma (4) went with him to the store to but some
things he</b>
<br><b>needed for the house and bought a small plastic swimming pool for
the kids</b>
<br><b>,but also bought Adrian some arm floats so that he could get in
with the</b>
<br><b>girls. My youngest daughter was taking a bath and I right then and
there</b>
<br><b>made the biggest mistake of my life that I will regret till I die
. To try</b>
<br><b>and hurry up I put Adrian in the tub with Dee Dee (3). I then went
back to</b>
<br><b>the kitchen and continued to clean the rest of the hopuse ckecking
in on</b>
<br><b>them several times. When i went back to get them out my daughter
was holding</b>
<br><b>my son up from under his arms from behind as if trying to hold him
up. My</b>
<br><b>could laid down flat on his back and his face would still have been
above</b>
<br><b>water.&nbsp; I pulled him out and started CPR till the ambulance
got there . To</b>
<br><b>make this story shorter my son died 3 days later. He was 10 months
old and</b>
<br><b>could already walk and didnt take a bottle. He could also get of
the bed</b>
<br><b>himself but couldnt get back on so he had the habit that if he got
off and</b>
<br><b>wanted to get back on he would nudge the bed until I woke up and
got him</b>
<br><b>back in bed with me. He loved to run in the hall way where my bathroom
was.</b>
<br><b>SO soon after my son died I found out I was pregnant again to say
the least</b>
<br><b>I didnt want another child. A couple of months passed when I started
to hear</b>
<br><b>and see strange things But I wasnt scared at all every one else
was</b>
<br><b>including my sister one night late while she was watching TV she
said she</b>
<br><b>saw a shadow out of the corner of her eye a small figure running
in the hall</b>
<br><b>by the bathroom my sister left the next day back to my moms house
and didnt</b>
<br><b>spend the night for a long time after. Another time my husband left
for work</b>
<br><b>early every morning&nbsp; at about 5:30 am and I would usually go
back to sleep</b>
<br><b>this time I kept feeling my bed move at first I thought it was my
husband</b>
<br><b>trying to get me to wake up I looked up and there was no one there
so I went</b>
<br><b>back to sleep again a little while later I felt it again at that
point I</b>
<br><b>knew who it was and for some strange reason I scuted ove on the
bed picked</b>
<br><b>up the covers as if to make room for him in the bed like I use to.&nbsp;
This</b>
<br><b>continued till I moved out of my home almost three years later.
also there</b>
<br><b>would be times that I would be cleaning the house while the kids
where at</b>
<br><b>school and I ahd pictures of him and his toys on the wall on shelves
would</b>
<br><b>fall for no reason and I know it was him trying to get my attention
to play</b>
<br><b>with him and I would stop what I was doing and talk to him and let
him know</b>
<br><b>that I loved him and that I was sorry for what happend. Later that
year I</b>
<br><b>gave birth to a baby boy on Halloween night. My son never got the
chance to</b>
<br><b>meet his brother but speaks of him as thought he knows him and will
tell me</b>
<br><b>things that only I know to be true .</b>
<br><b>My sons look like as if they were meant to be twins ..</b>

<p><b>An Overprotective Ghost?</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: WOOKlEWOO@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hi Dave!&nbsp; A good friend of mine, and also the only other person
who knows of</b>
<br><b>my experiences, other than the people it happened to, recommended
your site</b>
<br><b>to me.&nbsp; After taking a gander at your story, I suppose I feel
comfortable</b>
<br><b>enough in sharing mine.&nbsp; Heck, who wouldn't??</b>
<br><b>I would like to know if there is such a thing as an overprotective
ghost.</b>
<br><b>Here's my story:</b>
<br><b>When I was 18, and immediately after I graduated high school, I
married my</b>
<br><b>first husband.&nbsp; I was deeply in love with him, and also wanted
so badly to</b>
<br><b>get away from my parents.&nbsp; Well, as time progressed, my husband
quickly</b>
<br><b>became somewhat abusive.&nbsp; Sometimes physically, but mentally
for the most</b>
<br><b>part.&nbsp; We had one son during our marriage.&nbsp; After 3 years
of enduring the</b>
<br><b>bullcrap and feeling helpless, I was crying myself to sleep one
night, as I</b>
<br><b>often did.&nbsp; A voice which was as clear as a real person told
me to take my</b>
<br><b>son and get out.&nbsp; At the time, I thought we were being threatened.&nbsp;
The next</b>
<br><b>morning, for some strange reason I was a completely different person.&nbsp;
Maybe</b>
<br><b>it was due to the feeling of being threatened by something unknown,
or just a</b>
<br><b>surge of confidence.&nbsp; At any rate, we moved into an apartment
complex just</b>
<br><b>across the street from my parents house.&nbsp; It only took a matter
of one day to</b>
<br><b>make up my mind and have my own place by that night.</b>
<br><b>Everything was going great until I started dating.&nbsp; Never did
I let any of</b>
<br><b>the men meet my son, who was 2 at the time, (because I certainly
didn't want</b>
<br><b>my son being witness to men coming and going through my life).&nbsp;
He would stay</b>
<br><b>at my Mom and Dad's house if I had plans.&nbsp; Therefore, he was
nowhere around</b>
<br><b>to know what I was doing, much less play any pranks.&nbsp; The first
time I had</b>
<br><b>ever gone out, he had shown up a little early.&nbsp; I told him
I just needed a</b>
<br><b>few more minutes to finish getting ready, and I did the usual, cordial
stuff</b>
<br><b>such as offer him a seat and a drink, blah, blah.&nbsp; Well, as
I was coming from</b>
<br><b>the kitchen with a soft drink for him, he just looked at me with
the most</b>
<br><b>puzzled look I had ever seen.&nbsp; I laughed and said, "Don't worry,
I didn't</b>
<br><b>poison it or anything.&nbsp; That comes later."&nbsp; He kind of
halfheartedly smiled</b>
<br><b>and asked me if my son was there.&nbsp; I told him no and became
a bit leary that</b>
<br><b>he had asked, wondering what he may be up to.&nbsp; (I didn't have
much trust in</b>
<br><b>men at this point.)&nbsp; I said with a serious and stern voice,
"Why would you</b>
<br><b>ask such a thing?"&nbsp; He said that while I was in the kitchen,
a voice right in</b>
<br><b>his ear said, "You had better treat her with respect."&nbsp; I had
goosebumps</b>
<br><b>after he told me that.&nbsp; I laughed it off saying, "Well that
sounds like some</b>
<br><b>pretty sound advice to me."</b>
<br><b>As I was getting ready he hollered at me from the living room.&nbsp;
I came out</b>
<br><b>and asked him if he needed anything.&nbsp; He was already standing
up, and said he</b>
<br><b>had to go.&nbsp; Obviously, a bit surprised, I asked him if everything
was okay</b>
<br><b>and told him I was only joking about the poison.&nbsp; He told me
it wasn't me he</b>
<br><b>was afraid of, it was the guy in my apartment.&nbsp; I told him
to stop trying to</b>
<br><b>creep me out because after all, I had to live there, and if this
was his way</b>
<br><b>of trying to get me to jump into his arms with fear, then he would
be more</b>
<br><b>likely to get a kick in the throat first.&nbsp; He told me he was
serious and said</b>
<br><b>that while I was finishing getting ready, the same voice said to
him, "Don't</b>
<br><b>frighten her with your words, either!"&nbsp; Again, I had goosebumps.&nbsp;
He asked me</b>
<br><b>what that meant, and if I had a tape recorder or something and I
told him I</b>
<br><b>didn't know anything about any voices or tape recorders.&nbsp; I
agreed with his</b>
<br><b>decision and told him that he had probably better leave.&nbsp; Although,
at the</b>
<br><b>time, I thought HE was the weirdo!!</b>
<br><b>I went across the street and fetched my son and just told my parents
that I</b>
<br><b>started to feel sick and called off my plans.&nbsp; They asked if
they needed to</b>
<br><b>keep my son overnight so I could get some rest, but I declined and
we both</b>
<br><b>headed back to our apartment.&nbsp; Later that night, after I had
tucked my son</b>
<br><b>into bed and, just as I had laid down on the couch to go to sleep,
I heard a</b>
<br><b>man's voice tell me, "You'll always be safe now."&nbsp; I freaked
out at first,</b>
<br><b>but then after I closed my eyes and pulled the blanket up over my
head and</b>
<br><b>waited awhile, I felt the most inner peace I had ever felt in my
life.&nbsp; It</b>
<br><b>was as if I had finally found that 'unconditional love' that I had
always</b>
<br><b>wanted from someone, other than my son.&nbsp; Then, I felt a little
sorry for</b>
<br><b>thinking my 'non-date' was a weirdo.</b>
<br><b>After about a month, again I attempted to go on yet another date.&nbsp;
Except</b>
<br><b>this time, I purposely ran behind to see if the same thing would
happen to</b>
<br><b>this poor fella.&nbsp; Again, it did.&nbsp; But this time around,
the guy actually went</b>
<br><b>through with the date.&nbsp; However, he didn't reveal anything
to me until we</b>
<br><b>were at the restaurant.&nbsp; He said that he heard a man's voice
telling him to,</b>
<br><b>"Be nice."&nbsp; I pretended that this was the first I had heard
anything like</b>
<br><b>that.&nbsp; We never became serious, but it wasn't due to the voice.</b>
<br><b>Two and a half years later, I met the man whom I am married to now.
He still</b>
<br><b>hears the voice about once a week.&nbsp; Pretty much reassuring
my husband that I</b>
<br><b>can do no wrong in 'his' eyes.&nbsp; At least that's what my husband
feels.&nbsp; As</b>
<br><b>the years have gone by, (about 8), this presence has evolved from
only a</b>
<br><b>voice to a presence as well, showing itself every now and then,
but only to</b>
<br><b>me.&nbsp; Not a vivid sight that I can look straight at, but somewhat
of a shadow</b>
<br><b>that I can only see with peripheral vision.&nbsp; I'm not frightened
because he</b>
<br><b>has never done any physical harm to my children nor to me.&nbsp;
And honestly, I</b>
<br><b>feel very secure with him around.</b>
<br><b>However, my husband does get the short end of the deal.&nbsp; Anytime
we argue or</b>
<br><b>if I'm mad at my husband, our 'ghost', whom I had begun to call
"Slim",</b>
<br><b>(because his shadow seems slim, and also that was about the amount
of a</b>
<br><b>chance any guy would have while he was around), begins slamming
cabinet</b>
<br><b>doors, or turning the t.v. volume up, or flushing the toilet.&nbsp;
Anything to</b>
<br><b>get our attention.&nbsp; Then, my husband will go off into the bedroom,
and just</b>
<br><b>as he gets all the way into the room, Slim will slam the door shut,
as if to</b>
<br><b>punish my husband like he were a child.&nbsp; But Slim never breaks
anything.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>suppose he respects our things.&nbsp; He also has respect for our
two boys.&nbsp; I say</b>
<br><b>this because all the while he's slamming things, the children have
never</b>
<br><b>heard a thing.&nbsp; They can be in the next room and never hear
the cabinet</b>
<br><b>doors, the t.v. volume becoming louder (even if they're sitting
right in</b>
<br><b>front of it watching it), or anything for that matter.</b>
<br><b>The only time Slim really puts the fear into my husband is if my
husband does</b>
<br><b>something that has really hurt my feelings.&nbsp; Such as the time
I had made an</b>
<br><b>elaborate dinner on our 3rd Anniversary, and my husband, being the
typical</b>
<br><b>male, forgot what day it was, and hung out with his friends at a
sports pub.</b>
<br><b>Slim didn't like that at all.&nbsp; The minute my husband came home,
the front</b>
<br><b>porch light turned off and all the locks on the doors locked.&nbsp;
After I said</b>
<br><b>aloud that it was okay for him to come inside, the doors unlocked
and the</b>
<br><b>porchlight came on, but very dimly.&nbsp; I couldn't help but to
snicker at that</b>
<br><b>one.&nbsp; That night, my husband had very unnerving dreams about
me engaged in</b>
<br><b>different sexual relations.&nbsp; He told me that every scene included
me with a</b>
<br><b>different guy each time.&nbsp; He also told me that in the dream,
Slim played the</b>
<br><b>narrator, and kept repeating over and over, "She could have anyone
she wants,</b>
<br><b>but I'm the one who knows her best" in a very condescending type
of way.&nbsp; He</b>
<br><b>told me that this was probably because he had recalled the movie
"Flatliners"</b>
<br><b>in his sleep.&nbsp; But that morning, when he had finished his shower,
Slim had</b>
<br><b>written a message on the mirror that said, "No, but I did".</b>
<br><b>Since then, my husband has NEVER forgotten any special occasions.&nbsp;
He even</b>
<br><b>bought me a gift for "Administration Day"!!&nbsp; I realize this
is probably not a</b>
<br><b>very healthy relationship, but my husband knew the circumstances
before he</b>
<br><b>had asked me to marry him.&nbsp; Thank you for your time!</b>

<p><b>An Unusual Event</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:mccam@thegateway.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>Incident: We had received a phone call from our daughter in which
she told us she wanted to go out to eat after a football game. She had
been feeling badly earlier so we told her to come home. She was upset.
So we were preparing a meal for her to eat when she got home.</b>
<br><b>Both my wife and I were standing by the stove in the kitchen and
clearly heard the front door open and close. Immediately, Spike, a cat
located in the dining room, showed a strong fear reaction, jumping down
from the dining table and running out of the room. At this point, hearing
the rustling sounds of a person in the entry hall, I began to walk from
the kitchen to the entry hall to see who had come in the door. I was preceded
by Katie, another cat, who walked before me, looking toward the entry hall
in a curious, searching manner. I saw in my peripheral vision a light colored
blur for a second as I passed through the dining room. I looked in the
entry hall, bedroom and study and saw no one and returned to the kitchen.</b>
<br><b>My wife had remained in the kitchen. She assumed that she had heard
the sounds of our daughter returning home. When I returned to the kitchen,
she noticed a strange look on my face . I told her that no one had come
in and she, at once, knew a strange event had taken place.</b>
<br><b>We both discussed what we had perceived. We were both certain we
had heard the front door open and close. My wife had clearly heard footfalls,
I had not. We both remarked on the cats' behavior.</b>
<br><b>About five minutes later, Our daughter arrived and had to ring the
doorbell to get in, the front door being locked the whole time.</b>

<p><b>Abandoned House</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: JesusChrist@zombieweb.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I am a fellow ghost hunter and have my own crew of hunter. We are
called "Reaper and crew Ghost Hunter." My name I Kimberly. I have been
doing this line of work for almost all my life. Recently, my crew and I
have been going back and forth between two places. THere is this house
the I go to. It's small and creepy. Don't get me wrong, I usually don't
get scared, so for me to get scared, it means it must be bad. I've been
in there 47 times and everytime it feels like it's pulling me back. There
is a story to this place though. No one actually knows it all but it's
some freaky shiznit.</b>
<br><b>The Story:</b>
<br><b>Not too long ago, I was introduced to an old abandoned house by
my friends Brandon, and boyfriends at the times, Robin. Ever since something
has wanted me back there.</b>
<br><b>There used to be names all carved into the wall of the stairs, and
on my 7th time going, I carved my name into it too. The next time I went
my name was the only one left. (Now no one ever goes in there to fix the
place up so I definitely know that it wasn't anyone. It's still boarded
up....somewhat) Well, not too long ago I dragged my crew into there. I
though it was a bad idea. But they really wanted to go. Well on our 3rd
visit something bad finally happened. My friends Fee was going upstairs
to the attic when all of the sudden I get called in. I found her shaking
and screaming in pain. She was being phased into. I tried to force the
spirits out of her but to no avail. I told her she had to get it out of
her if she wanted to live....</b>
<br><b>Fast forward, to a few weeks ago, it was a Tuesday. The land was
covered in a bed of fog. It was my crew and I, plus 1 extra person. The
crew didn't want to go in so I went in with my friends Ryan and Ian. We
headed up the long field and I swore I saw a large beast-like figure walking
towards us. I crouched down and it soon mimmicked me. My friend Ryan saw
it happen. Then I said "We don't have much time. We have to get in the
house and quickly." I stood up and we all ran into the house. Stupid me
had no shoes or sandles on, but I was fine. Except I now have 3 cuts on
my feet. I gave Ian the "Grand Tour" lol. We went to the first basement.
We went down the stairs, and in a dream I had there was something burried
at the bottom of the steps. So we brought a shovel to see if there was
anything there...It was concrete. But I stood where the old man died. You
could feel the cold spot very well. All of the sudden I heard Fee up at
the window asking for help. I told Ryan to go help her since she didn't
have a flashli got up and began to drag her. I let them go first to make
sure she got out safely. When I got the the second floor stairs I felt
something large grab my rib cage and squeeze my like I was a orange. I
lost all breath in my and I turned purple. I fell down and stood up soon
after. We got to the first floor and I saw something croutched at the stairs.
I let them get out first and I was the last one to exit as usual :) Troy
was outside looking out at the woods because he said he saw something.
He was in a cop stance with his gun out. I soon realized that they did
containment spells on the place. Which was a bad idea. The thing I was
seeing is a guardian force of that land. The people who once lived there
were tortured and taunted by this thing. The planted trees because the
thought it was good for protection. But what they don't know is that it
making that thing stronger. It's strange though, evertime I go there there
are new trees planted. I mean freshly planted. I've seen the guardian though.
Well That's it for now.</b>

<p><b>Banging Cups</b><b></b>

<p><b>My name is Araby.&nbsp; I was looking at your ghost stories and I
have one to share with you, this particular fragment is called&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"Banging Cups":</b>
<br><b>I have had very many things that just can't be explained happen
to me since I was just 1. (Yes, I can remember that far back when something
unforgettable happens to you its very easy to.........)&nbsp; Any ways,
One of the most frightening things ever to happen to me was when I was
12. I'll start from the beginning.&nbsp; You see, my mom keeps a tall,
green, swirvey glass besides the blender.&nbsp; She uses it every morning,
so it is always there at nite.&nbsp; I had gotten a very bad ear ache and
I couldnt sleep, because I couldn't put pressure on my ear.&nbsp; So I
decided to go to the living room and watch a little t.v. and maybe I could
fall asleep setting down with no pain.&nbsp; Well, when I got out to the
living room, I turned on the t.v. and I had my pillow and blanket in my
hand. I sat down on the couch, and the t.v. was just too bright, so I turned
it to a channel wher't any way to wake me up, either.&nbsp; Ever since
then, I could finish other peoples sentences and know what people are thinking
and that kind of thing.&nbsp; Thank you for taking the time to read my
stories.&nbsp; If you have any questions, please e-mail me. Thank you so
much again</b><b></b>

<p><b>Okay, so here it is.&nbsp; I guess I was about 16 years old living
out in the country in Ontario, Canada.&nbsp; My parents lived in a survey
that used to be all farm land.&nbsp; Well, one night I was home alone because
my parents had gone out to my aunt and uncles house for a party.&nbsp;
Not an unusual occurance for a 16 year old to be home alone.&nbsp; Now,
I'm sure this didn't help but I decided to watch the movie Halloween that
night and even turned out all of the lights for effect (I was always into
scary movies and such, still am).&nbsp; My dog at the time was laying beside
my chair on the floor in the family room.&nbsp; The family room had two
entrances - one large one that opened up to the kitchen and a normal sized
one that opened up to the hallway that led to the basement door at the
end.&nbsp; Now this basement door always stuck so that to open it you would
have to turn the knob and give it a bit of a tug and it always made this
screeching kind of noise as it came loose.&nbsp; Well there I am at about
10:00 pm watching this movie when my dog who was asleep suddenly puts her
head up (she was lying in front of the doorway that opens to the basement
door hallway), and begins this really low growling noise.&nbsp; I lean
over the side of my chair to see what she's looking at and she's staring
right at the basement door.&nbsp; I figured she was hearing things and
told her to be quiet.&nbsp; Usually she was a very obedient dog but she
completely ignored me this time.&nbsp; Well by then I was getting pretty
nervous because she won't look away from the basement door and she won't
stop growling.&nbsp; So by this time I'm standing up looking down the hall
at the basement door too and am scared to death because I'm thinking that
maybe someone got into the house and was hiding behind the basement door.&nbsp;
Well then doesn't the door open.&nbsp; I'm standing there watching the
door and I can't see the knob turning because it's down the hall and it's
dark, but all of a sudden I hear that screeching noise the door makes when
it's being opened and my dog jumps up and barks at the door and starts
to growl really loudly - although she won't go anywhere near the door.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
So the door opens but only a crack and then after a second it closes again.&nbsp;
Now there was a fan on in the room I was in but first of all it's too far
away from the basement door to be able to close it - I mean you had to
give it a pretty good push to get it closed - and even then, how the hell
did it open in the first place?&nbsp; So I calmly strolled into the kitchen
and picked up a large butcher knife and scooted over to the phone to call
my friend who lived just down the street (remember I still thought that
maybe someone got into my house and was hiding downstairs and I sure wnated
to be armed in case anything popped out of that basement door and headed
my way).&nbsp; I whispered into the phone to my friend that I thought someone
was in the house and that I was coming to her place.&nbsp; After I hung
up I said to my dog in as normal a voice I could "come on, I'd better take
you out for a walk", opened the side door, closed it behind us and ran
like hell in bare feet down a gravel driveway and all the way down the
street with a butcher knife in hand and a madly barking dog running beside
me (what people must have thought if they looked out their window at just
that moment).&nbsp; I phoned my parents from her house and refused to go
home until they were there and had checked out the house, which they did
and of course found nothing.&nbsp; Nothing else ever really happened after
that except that occasionally my dog would abruptly stare at the basement
door and growl slightly under her breath.</b>

<p><b>I have always believed in the occult.&nbsp; Well, not necesarily
the Occult, per se, but I have believed in ghosts since I was a wee little
girl.&nbsp; Anyway, last year, me and about seven friends had a holoween
party.&nbsp; One of my friends brought her Ouija board.&nbsp; I have a
ouija board of my own, but it doesn't really do much, as opposed to my
friend's, who had had a long run of very creepy messages.&nbsp; Anyway.&nbsp;
I was in the mood for some serious communication so I set down an ultimatum.&nbsp;
All of those who didn't believe or would want to mess up the seance left,
and we were left with me and my 5 best friends, all of whom are very serious
about this sort of thing.&nbsp; I honestly doubt any of them would rig
a seance.&nbsp; So, I lit the candles and started the procedures.&nbsp;
We started by asking simple questions.&nbsp; Then we asked it it's name.&nbsp;
It spelt out S P I R I T.&nbsp; This totally freaked out one of the girls,
who backed off from the board.&nbsp; Then we asked what the name of my
friend's (the one sitting out) great-aunts name.&nbsp; It replied WHICH
ONE.&nbsp; We refined our question, asking 'what is Elayna's (the girl's)
great aunt's name, the one with two others of the same?'&nbsp; (she had
3 great aunts with the same name)&nbsp; it replied I DON'T KNOW.&nbsp;
Which was somewhat dissapointing, but honest, and startlingly coherent.&nbsp;
Then we asked 'Is there anything you want to tell us?'&nbsp; At this point
things started going wierd.&nbsp; I had lit about 6 candles.&nbsp; All
of them started flickering, and two went out.&nbsp; Then it said WHO WILL
LIE.&nbsp; I got the wierdest feeling in my throat-- but that may have
been because I was scared.&nbsp; The little indicator thing came to rest
on Goodbye.&nbsp; At this point, one of the insensitive few who'd left
came and pounded on the window, giving us all minor heart attacks.&nbsp;
We were really freaked by this time, but we asked it "Who will lie?"&nbsp;
but it wouldn't say anything after that....</b>
<br><b>I have another, unrelated incident, that may or may not be a ghost,
but why not.</b>
<br><b>I was probably around 11 at the time.&nbsp; My mother worked in
a school.&nbsp; The building itself used to be a hardware store, I believe,
but it was converted into a school in the early 80's.&nbsp; But anyway.&nbsp;
I was in the bathroom, just opening the stall door, when I heard someone
breathing.&nbsp; At first I thought it was the air vents, but it was coming
from the opposite side of the room.&nbsp; Then I thought it was one of
the older kids, trying to scare me.&nbsp; I threw open the stall door and
opened the other three quickly.&nbsp; Noone was there.&nbsp; The breathing
stopped, and I ran as fast as I could out of there.</b><b></b>

<p><b>I have been reading the South Jersey Ghost Research and Shadowlands
sites,</b>
<br><b>and I have decided to share a story with you.</b>
<br><b>Ever since I was a young girl, people have at times told me that
they have</b>
<br><b>seen me in places where I am not.&nbsp; Many times these apparitions
have been</b>
<br><b>attributed to a "twin."&nbsp; When the person is described, she
is always wearing</b>
<br><b>clothing that meets the description of clothing that I have or am
wearing at</b>
<br><b>that time.</b>
<br><b>The first occurance I can remember was by my brother at a bank where
he</b>
<br><b>worked in Philadelphia.</b>
<br><b>The second was a time when I attended Oxford, and I actually awoke
feeling a</b>
<br><b>presence in my room, but I was not afraid because it was I, so I
just turned</b>
<br><b>over and went back to sleep.&nbsp; The next morning another student
complained</b>
<br><b>that she could not sleep because there was a presence wandering
in her room.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; I wonder if that presence was I?</b>
<br><b>The third time was by my sister-in law's brother near Cooper Hospital
in</b>
<br><b>Camden just a few days before my father died.</b>
<br><b>I thought you might be interested.&nbsp; I have read your story
and was</b>
<br><b>fascinated by it.</b>
<br><b>Thank you for your time and consideration.&nbsp; If you respond

<p><b>My name is Dwayne R , I am 35 and live in Q.L.D Australia</b>
<br><b>I would like to share with you a real life encounter from the other
side.</b>
<br><b>It was 1974 so I was about 8 years old,I lived in a big old house
in a town of South Australia named Black Forest.</b>
<br><b>This was a spooky place where alot of weird and unexplained things
happened, it was believed that a satanic cult resided somewhere in the
town, but I believed this was just kids trying to scare one another. But
one frightening night I started to believe that it just might be true.</b>
<br><b>I was in my bedroom playing instead of sleeping when I suddenly
felt a chilling breeze pass by me, this got my attention immediately, as
I looked up I saw what seemed to be a dark shadow of a person in the corner
of the room.</b>
<br><b>I was instantly scared sheetless so I leapt on to my bed and hid
under the blanket trying not to move the slightest bit, I thought even
breathing would bring upon attention to myself, I figured if I cant see
it, it can't see me.</b>
<br><b>At that moment my body, the blanket still covering me was lifted
about 2-3 feet above the bed then violently slammed back down onto the
bed.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I wasn't a bed wetter till that night, laying there under
the blanket soaked in urine for what seemed like and probably was hours,
I finally got enough courage to run to mums room where I told her about
what just happened, like all good mums she just reassured me I had had
a bad dream and sent me back to bed.</b>
<br><b>I often saw this shadowy figure in my room, I named him 'Darkman',
but it only ever touched me the one time.</b>
<br><b>Several weeks later again while trying to go to sleep , I heard
music playing , it was strange but pleasant music , I thought my sister
had left her radio on so I went to her room to ask her to turn it off as
it was keeping me awake. When I got into my sisters room the music switched
rooms, I asked my sister if she could hear the music? She replied to my
delight Yes, we decided to go and investigate the music but it seemed to
cycle around the house, at that mum told us it was the neighbours and to
get to bed , I knew it wasn't the neighbours music as they were old people
who couldn't even here and I never heard them play music.</b>
<br><b>This strange phenomenon would happen 2-3 times a week so I got use
to it and mostly ignored it, but one night the 'Darkman' was very active
as was the music, it was a lot louder and the 'Darkman' was hovering above
my bed, I was so scared thinking that it was going to pick me up and hurt
me again I ran out of my room into the lounge room where I was confronted
by my mum and some of her friends. I was crying so mum asked to explain
what the problem was, I told her of the 'Darkman' and the music, at that
a male friend of hers, a stranger to me laughed and replied "looks like
we have contacted more than your father", I was puzzled by his remark so
I asked him what he meant, he started to explain to me that the letters
and the numbers the upturned glass, which was on the floor in front of
them, was an adults way of contacting dead people and that they had been
talking to my grandfather.</b>
<br><b>I will always remember my experience as a terrifying one, and couldn't
believe my grandfather would ever pick me up from my bed and throw me down
and simply terrify the hell out of me, I believe my mum was messing with
something bad of which she had no idea about.</b>
<br><b>This is a very real and true story of my FIRST encounter with the
dark side!</b>
<br><b>I have had many other encounters, which still happen to this day.</b>

<p><b>How He Died</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: angelic_sparklepritty@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Most of the things I am about to tell you didnt</b>
<br><b>happen to me personally but my parents. I was there at</b>
<br><b>the time but was too young to really remember.</b>
<br><b>We lived in a house in a place called Blossom Street.</b>
<br><b>It was no different from any of the other houses but</b>
<br><b>the moment we moved in my mother felt uncomfortable.</b>
<br><b>She always felt someone was watching her.</b>
<br><b>There was a door leading from the kitchen to the</b>
<br><b>bottom of the stairs and every night when my parents</b>
<br><b>went to bed it would open and close by itself. Anyway</b>
<br><b>my parents decided that rather than putting a carpet</b>
<br><b>at the bottom of the stairs they would varnish the</b>
<br><b>floorboards to make them look nice. My dad did this</b>
<br><b>one night before he went to bed and put a piece of</b>
<br><b>wood across the floor for us to walk on while the</b>
<br><b>varnish dried overnight.</b>
<br><b>When my mum and dad were in bed they heard the door</b>
<br><b>open and close as usual and then they heard sticky</b>
<br><b>footsteps coming up the stairs as if someone had stood</b>
<br><b>on the wet floorboards. This scared them a lot.</b>
<br><b>I was a very young child at the time but my only</b>
<br><b>memory is being in bed. I had a glass of milk by the</b>
<br><b>bed and it smashed onto the floor. I KNOW that I</b>
<br><b>didnt touch it but being so young I didnt really get</b>
<br><b>scared at the time.</b>
<br><b>Then one night my dad got up to go to the toilet. The</b>
<br><b>toilet looked directly down onto the bottom of the</b>
<br><b>stairs. He saw a man standing with a blue face looking</b>
<br><b>up at him. But he just dismissed it as a dream.</b>
<br><b>Eventually my parents decided to move home because</b>
<br><b>they couldnt settle in the house. A few weeks</b>
<br><b>afterwards my parents were out having a quiet drink</b>
<br><b>when a man approached them. He asked why they had</b>
<br><b>moved house because he said nobody had ever lived</b>
<br><b>there more than a few months. They replied that they</b>
<br><b>just didnt feel comfortable.</b>
<br><b>The man asked if they knew the house was haunted. He</b>
<br><b>said that years ago an old railway line had ran</b>
<br><b>directly under the house and a young girl had been</b>
<br><b>murdered there. He also said that the last person to</b>
<br><b>live in the house for a long time had been a man. He</b>
<br><b>was found dead at the foot of the stairs. He was</b>
<br><b>believed to have died from shock, maybe he had seen</b>
<br><b>something scary. But if he died from fright wouldnt</b>
<br><b>has face have been blue?</b>

<p><b>Boo! ....But it was real.....</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: dewee@frontiernet.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>In the mid-seventies, my college roommate and I were asked if we'd
stay at one of our professors house while he was away for the summer.&nbsp;
Originally he had rented it out to what he thought was a nice young couple.&nbsp;
Apparently after the professor left the couple invited several people to
live with them.&nbsp; They belonged to some sort of cult.&nbsp; I have
no information as to what their beliefs were, only some tales from neighbors
who said that the&nbsp; resident's children there begged for food.&nbsp;
At any rate, they were evicted, and my roommate and I moved into the house.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; The house itself was quite old, at least close to 100 yrs.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I t had an old country post-office attached to it and I believe that the
house had been used as a boarding house many years ago. It sat on a back
road, next to a rail-road crossing.&nbsp; Freight trains were still using
that route.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;The house had 6 bedrooms, two baths, kitchen, study and living
room.&nbsp; It was very messy from the previous tenants.&nbsp; There were
packets of salt hung in little bags over the doorways leading outside.&nbsp;
There were gauzy white curtains hung from the ceilings in the middle of
the bedrooms and we found the heads of baby dolls in many of the rooms....they
were marked up with magic marker.....as if someone was trying to erase
the faces.&nbsp;&nbsp; I think the previous tenants were afraid of something.</b>
<br><b>The place was creepy and dark, but we ignored that, had a few shivers
and started to move in.&nbsp; That night we couldn't get the lights on...and
sat up in the kitchen in the dark until the professor (who was spending
the night before leaving,) somehow got the electricity back on again.&nbsp;
Later that night, we picked our bedrooms.&nbsp; (My roommate and I are
females.)&nbsp; I choose a bedroom toward the front of the house, and she
chose&nbsp; one towards the back.&nbsp; We had a sort of peaceful night,
my dogs, (2) were restless, and the cat was wandering.&nbsp; The next morning
my roommate said that she was changing her bedroom.&nbsp; No reason, just
that she couldn't sleep in there, got a bad feeling......&nbsp; During
the time we stayed in that house, no guest would stay in that room.&nbsp;
The only explanation was that they just weren't comfortable and that it
was creepy.</b>
<br><b>We ended up staying at that house for several years.&nbsp; When
I think back I can't understand why I didn't leave the first night.</b>
<br><b>I always had the feeling I was being watched.&nbsp; Many times I
would wake in my bed knowing that something was standing there watching
me.&nbsp; I could feel something almost touching&nbsp; me, my head and
back....and then it would go away.&nbsp; I would fight my terror and pretend
it was a nightmare.&nbsp; Although my dog was in the room he would never
seem to notice anything.&nbsp; He would sleep under the covers with me....</b>
<br><b>It was interesting that the dogs would bark at the ceiling in the
living room sometimes...very fiercely.....right where the creepy bedroom
was above us.&nbsp;&nbsp; At one point the closet in that room had to have
part of a wall removed for electrical work, and it was discovered that
a small room had been walled off behind the closet.&nbsp; There was nothing
in it, nor was it painted etc....just empty space.&nbsp; Odd.</b>
<br><b>Also I would like to add that we would place items, personal items
like hair-bands, barrettes, hair-brushes in one room and then find them
on the dresser in another room.&nbsp; We would chuckle and say it was the
"ghost"....But is was never really funny.</b>
<br><b>One night when I felt I was being watched.....I gathered my courage
and reached up and turned on the light.&nbsp; I saw nothing and then yellow-jacket
bees.....about 6 of them, started flying around my light.&nbsp; I found
this odd as bees are not attracted to light like moths etc. plus bees are
not active at night.&nbsp; They eventually flew off and I never saw them
in the room again.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; The feeling of being watched remained strong, throughout
my stay there.&nbsp; Day and night, only when I was alone.&nbsp; My roommate
said she often felt that something was watching her too.</b>
<br><b>Eventually I left that house.&nbsp; I always sensed anger in that
place and not surprisingly everyone that lived there left the place on
bad terms.&nbsp; The first night I spent in my new place I experienced
intense relief...as if I left a strange world and came back to the present.</b>
<br><b>About 20 years later I returned to the house to show it to a friend.&nbsp;
The post-office part had been turned into a little store and a wall torn
down so we could see the living room behind it.&nbsp; The woman who ran
the store said she lived in the house.&nbsp; I asked her in an off-hand
way, if she ever noticed anything strange about the house.&nbsp; She got
a funny look on her face and became VERY business-like.&nbsp; So we left.&nbsp;
From time to time I still dream of this house...and in my dreams I am fighting
an invisible force and seem to have powers of my own against ....it.&nbsp;
I win, barely, and wake up in a sweat.</b>
<br><b>Everything I wrote here is true.&nbsp; This place scared me badly.&nbsp;
Now, I trust my "gut" feelings and never stay anywhere that I fell is bad.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Any thoughts about this would be helpful.</b>

<p><b>Cabin Haunting in California</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Craftygrl1027@cs.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hello ,my name is lisa and my family used to own a cabin in&nbsp;
ca.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;My grandfather built this cabin in</b>
<br><b>the early 70's . There are many different things that happened,
and I will</b>
<br><b>tell you about some of them. First , I must tell you what I know
about the</b>
<br><b>history of the town .Pine Grove is a very small town located near
Jackson</b>
<br><b>,Ca. In the late 1800's there was an out break of small pox and
it nearly</b>
<br><b>wiped out the entire town . There was also alot of mining going
on, since its</b>
<br><b>located near sutters mill, and the cabin is sitting on a old mine
entrance.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;When my family finished the cabin , they were staying there
for the weekend</b>
<br><b>and my aunt Diane , who was only 12 at the time, was sleeping. The
cabin was</b>
<br><b>just one big room at that time, and she awoke to see an older man
wearing</b>
<br><b>overalls standing over the sink staring at her. She was so frightened
, she</b>
<br><b>fell off of the top bunk. I'm pretty sure that was the first experience</b>
<br><b>anyone had. My grandmother kept on having things happen to her and
decided to</b>
<br><b>excorsize the spirits, she had someone come to the cabin, but then
at the</b>
<br><b>last minute she told the person that she didn't want to go through
with it. I</b>
<br><b>think that was in the early 80's.She says that she got the feeling
that</b>
<br><b>whoever was there did not want to go, and that they weren't doing
any harm,</b>
<br><b>so they could stay. My grandmother says that she would see things
flying</b>
<br><b>across the room, and feel someone breathing behind her. My grandmother
says</b>
<br><b>she doesnt mind which I believe , because she's such a strong person.</b>
<br><b>Fast forward to the mid 80's. My mom and two of her friends were
at the cabin</b>
<br><b>along with me and my moms friends daughter.It was the middle of
the night,</b>
<br><b>and&nbsp; Teresa got up to go to the bathroom ,when she saw a man
standing next to</b>
<br><b>a bookcase , she thought it was one of their boyfriends that were
sopposed to</b>
<br><b>arrive the next day , and that they came early and she&nbsp; then
went back to</b>
<br><b>bed.The men showed up that a.m . None of the men had arrived early
. That</b>
<br><b>year at thanksgiving , my mom showed a picture that Teresa had drawn
of the</b>
<br><b>man she had seen that night to my aunt Diane.She about passed out
, it was</b>
<br><b>the same man she had seen when she was 12 yrs. old. We still have
that</b>
<br><b>picture and it always gives me chills to look at.</b>
<br><b>So ,things kept on happening over the years, and nothing was happening
to me,</b>
<br><b>so I was skeptical. Until the day when the spirit decided to show
himself to</b>
<br><b>me. I was 13 yrs old and hadn't been to cabin in a couple yrs. So
I was a</b>
<br><b>little scared because I had heard of all this stuff growing up and
was afraid</b>
<br><b>that since I was older that I would see something. It was breakfast
and&nbsp; my</b>
<br><b>mom and gramma were cooking , and me and my granpa were at the table.
We were</b>
<br><b>the only people there . All of a sudden, we all heard the front
door open ,</b>
<br><b>then slam shut ,and footstps coming up the stairs. I looked at my
granma and</b>
<br><b>she just shrugged and said that "he" was just visiting us. That
night I saw</b>
<br><b>"him" standing next to the sink just staring at me. I ran to the
room that I</b>
<br><b>was sleeping in and covered my eyes.That whole time we were there
I felt as</b>
<br><b>if I was being watched.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;My aunt diane was living at the cabin a couple of years ago
,and although</b>
<br><b>she didn't see "him" she did see two small girls dressed in old
clothing</b>
<br><b>skipping down the road in front of the cemetary that is right by
the cabin.</b>
<br><b>When she looked closer , she saw that they were floating above ground
and</b>
<br><b>when she looked back , they weren't there.</b>
<br><b>That was the last any of us saw the spirits because my family was
forced to</b>
<br><b>sell the cabin in 1998 and I always wonder about the new owners
,and if the</b>
<br><b>spirits are bothering them. I wonder if they are mad that we're
gone. We</b>
<br><b>didn't really get to say good bye to the cabin , because the sale
happened so</b>
<br><b>fast, and I feel that the spirits were close to us and felt secure
with us</b>
<br><b>there. I will always be thinking of them and sometimes I dream of
the man I</b>
<br><b>saw and I wonder if he is still trying to contact us.&nbsp; GOOD
LUCK TO THE NEW</b>
<br><b>OWNERS AND REMEMBER THE SPIRITS CAN SENSE FEAR AND ACT UPON IT.</b><b></b>

<br><b>CAN CONFIRM POWAHTAN SIGHTING!!</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: rebelcayman@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp; I am really excited. During one of my stays at</b>
<br><b>Powahtan Plantation in Williamsburg Virginia. I swear</b>
<br><b>i aws the same exact thing that</b>
<br><b>bates@characterlink.net&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; saw. I was&nbsp; 15 at
this time</b>
<br><b>and Me and a friend i had met there were fishing in</b>
<br><b>one of the ponds there, which are located behind the</b>
<br><b>units. Anyway we were sick of catching the little</b>
<br><b>perch so we decided we would go out deeper(about up to</b>
<br><b>our waistes in the water). I guess we had startled</b>
<br><b>something by doing this, but we then heard a loud</b>
<br><b>clapping which sounded as if a something clapping the</b>
<br><b>water. We followed&nbsp; the noise to an overhang of trees</b>
<br><b>and bushes we dared not go before because we were</b>
<br><b>afraid of maybe a&nbsp; water mocassin lying in the brush.</b>
<br><b>But we decided to look into the opening anyway. We</b>
<br><b>first noticed a&nbsp; goose(there is a large population of</b>
<br><b>canadian geese there) floating on the surface chest</b>
<br><b>down beating its wings against the water.&nbsp;&nbsp; We looked</b>
<br><b>closer to see what looked to be a turtle head clamping</b>
<br><b>to the birds chest. The bird was then lifted from the</b>
<br><b>surface reavealing a long whitish neck of the</b>
<br><b>proclaimed turtle.We were very disturbed at this but</b>
<br><b>continued to watch a few feet fearther away though. We</b>
<br><b>figured the whitish color was from maybe being burnt</b>
<br><b>my something and the skin was healing. The neck stood</b>
<br><b>straight out of the&nbsp; water maybe a 7 inch length then</b>
<br><b>ploped down bringing the small goose with it. This was</b>
<br><b>a bizarre encouter but we still stood there in shock.</b>
<br><b>It was about 10 seconds later when the bird ploped up</b>
<br><b>with the turtle right after it.It was now floating to</b>
<br><b>where we could see most of the body. We saw the white</b>
<br><b>stop where the shell began, the skin seemed to a</b>
<br><b>brownish green. The weirdest thing was the shell, not</b>
<br><b>a rough looking shell but more of a leathery complex,</b>
<br><b>and a lighter color than the skin. I did not see the</b>
<br><b>tail but&nbsp; what i saw of it was about a 4ft turtle with</b>
<br><b>a hard beaklike snout(a very large one). I figured it</b>
<br><b>was normal until i realized that most turtles eat fish</b>
<br><b>and most ive seed have rough shells. That is my story</b>
<br><b>of the turtle-like creature that rules the large ponds</b>
<br><b>of Powahtan Plantation Va. We can call it "Swami". I</b>
<br><b>am glad to hear i wasnt crazy and another person can</b>

<br><b>Catman - a Ghost(?) Story</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Heuy815@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These events actually happened.&nbsp; I'm not
sure what exactly transpired,</b>
<br><b>so I'll detail the events as I encountered them.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was about 2 years ago and it was in early
fall.&nbsp; The windows were</b>
<br><b>shut tight against the chilly night air.&nbsp; I had been asleep
in my bed for a</b>
<br><b>couple of hours.&nbsp; The mantle clock had just rung two in the
morning when all</b>
<br><b>of a sudden one of my little girls, whose bedroom is upstairs, started</b>
<br><b>screaming.&nbsp; At first, as I climbed the stairs, I didn't understand
what she</b>
<br><b>was saying.&nbsp; Her terrified little voice was in a high pitch
frenzy.&nbsp; "Daddy,</b>
<br><b>daddy," she cried "the shadow man is by the door and won't let me
out."&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>burst through the door thinking that maybe a burglar had gotten
in to her</b>
<br><b>room somehow, but there was nothing except a very scared little
girl cowering</b>
<br><b>in her bed.&nbsp; She leapt into my arms and hugged me with a death
grip begging</b>
<br><b>me to let her sleep in my bed that night.&nbsp; I told her that
she had had a bad</b>
<br><b>dream, but that it would be OK so long as she didn't wake up her
sister who</b>
<br><b>was still sound asleep in the bed next to hers.&nbsp; We tip toed
out of the room,</b>
<br><b>with my exhausted angel in my arms.&nbsp; We got to my bedroom and
I tucked her in</b>
<br><b>and got in myself.&nbsp; Once all situated and comfy the screaming
began with the</b>
<br><b>other daughter who was still in the same bedroom.&nbsp; So I go
running up the</b>
<br><b>stairs and ask her what was the matter.&nbsp; She tells me that
the "shadow man"</b>
<br><b>was in the room with her.&nbsp; I begin to wonder if there isn't
someone in the</b>
<br><b>room.&nbsp; So I send her downstairs and turn on all the lights
and do a search</b>
<br><b>through the room.&nbsp; I open closet doors and check under beds.&nbsp;
Nothing.&nbsp; My</b>
<br><b>brain is now reeling.&nbsp; How could the two of them had the same
bad dream?</b>
<br><b>This was starting to bug me, but as the numbers on the clock reminded
me that</b>
<br><b>it was two-thirty in the morning I put sleep on the top of my things
to do</b>
<br><b>list and headed back to bed.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So now it is the three of us in my queen size
bed.&nbsp; A five year old on</b>
<br><b>one side of me and a seven year old on the other.&nbsp; We all settle
in and they</b>
<br><b>drop off sleep immediately.&nbsp; I again begin to get comfortable
when I hear</b>
<br><b>something walking in their bedroom above us.&nbsp; I panic.&nbsp;
When I searched the</b>
<br><b>room there was nothing.&nbsp; Yet, I hear a heavy set of feet walking
across their</b>
<br><b>room.&nbsp; The steps start down the stairs.&nbsp; Fear overcomes
me and I wonder what</b>
<br><b>to do.&nbsp; Do I dial 911 or somehow protect my children first
and then call?</b>
<br><b>The foot steps begin to approach my room, so I quickly cover my
kids up with</b>
<br><b>the blanket and sit up in the bed.&nbsp; I am ready to scream like
a banshee for</b>
<br><b>help when I notice that, instead of an intruder, there is a black
cat</b>
<br><b>standing at the door of my bedroom.&nbsp; Figuring that it must
be the time of</b>
<br><b>night playing tricks on my ears, I really thought that the foot
steps were</b>
<br><b>make by a two legged not four legged creature and heavy enough to
be a man,</b>
<br><b>not a house cat.</b>
<br><b>Being allergic to cats and not sure how the cat got into my house,
I am</b>
<br><b>concerned that it will want to get into the bed with us and drop
all sorts of</b>
<br><b>dander into my bed.&nbsp; Just what I need.&nbsp; So I begin to
say things like "shoo"</b>
<br><b>to frighten the cat from my bed room.&nbsp; But to no avail.&nbsp;
As I focus in on the</b>
<br><b>cat it begins to haunch up and then proceeds to jump over my bed
-- a</b>
<br><b>distance of over ten feet.&nbsp; It doesn't land in my room though.&nbsp;
It sails</b>
<br><b>through a closed glass window and disappears as it does.&nbsp; No
shattered glass</b>
<br><b>and no cat.&nbsp; It just dematerialized in front of my own eyes.&nbsp;
So there I sit</b>
<br><b>and freak out.&nbsp; My two girls asleep in my bed because of a
similar "shadow</b>
<br><b>man" dream and myself, a witness to the vanishing cat all in one
night.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can anyone make out what happened?&nbsp; It is
still a mystery to me.</b>

<br><b>Child Hood Scare</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: m_mad_250@yahoo.com.au</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hi, my name is Melanie. And as I realise most of these</b>
<br><b>stories come from the states, I actually come from the</b>
<br><b>land down under (Australia). I dont really and trully</b>
<br><b>remember how old I was when I first saw anything out</b>
<br><b>of the ordinary, I was probably around 2 or 3. The</b>
<br><b>furthest back I remember is that, I was living in an</b>
<br><b>old house on an Air Force base. It was a two story</b>
<br><b>house which I really loved.</b>
<br><b>I remember one night, I was finding it extremely hard</b>
<br><b>to sleep. I was looking around my room and things were</b>
<br><b>taking shape and form on the walls of my room in the</b>
<br><b>shadows of the night. What was strange though, was</b>
<br><b>that it was in colour. I got up and walked out to the</b>
<br><b>lounge and got my dad to come and sleep with me.</b>
<br><b>While I was still wide awake, hed already dozed off.</b>
<br><b>When I had gotten back to my room, the things on the</b>
<br><b>wall were gone. What I had seen were a lot of lady</b>
<br><b>bugs  big ones  and also a skeleton. I wasnt</b>
<br><b>afraid, I didnt even really think anything of it when</b>
<br><b>I had seen it. I guess some little kids are just too</b>
<br><b>imune to know what is meant to be feared. Anyways, my</b>
<br><b>dad had fallen asleep and the things had started to</b>
<br><b>appear again, only this time they were going onto the</b>
<br><b>floor and onto my bed. My dad was sleeping next to the</b>
<br><b>wall and there was a lady bug on his back. It was</b>
<br><b>surely moving and I hit it  or should I say I hit</b>
<br><b>him. He woke and asked me what I was doing. I said</b>
<br><b>there was a bug on your back.</b>
<br><b>He nodded it off and went back to sleep.</b>
<br><b>About a year later, my brother was born  Ben. I never</b>
<br><b>trully liked him. I guess I was jealous of him at the</b>
<br><b>time because he was getting all the attention.</b>
<br><b>Anyways, my mum used to put us in the bath together,</b>
<br><b>hoping that we would perhaps begin to bond. Well, I</b>
<br><b>never did anything terrible to him, but we stayed kind</b>
<br><b>of mutual. There was this really horrible looking toy</b>
<br><b>my mum used to put in the bath with us  I couldnt</b>
<br><b>stand it.</b>
<br><b>It was a comic like baby girl in a yellow dress,</b>
<br><b>crying. It was made of plastic, the kind they make</b>
<br><b>rubber duckies with. It was trully ugly, she would</b>
<br><b>always put it in the bath with us and I would always</b>
<br><b>throw it into the shower once she was gone. So</b>
<br><b>anyways, this doll toy will lead to another strange</b>
<br><b>thing that happened to me.</b>
<br><b>When Ben was about a year and half, I was about 4. We</b>
<br><b>slept in the same room. Anyway. I was busting to go to</b>
<br><b>the toilet one night. I hardly ever held it in, but on</b>
<br><b>this night I did for some strange reason. I eventually</b>
<br><b>got up and walked slowly to the bathroom in the dark </b>
<br><b>everyone was already asleep. So, I was down a hall to</b>
<br><b>the lavatory when I heard crying. I was thinking where</b>
<br><b>on earth is that coming from?</b>
<br><b>I was half afraid, but also half curious to see what</b>
<br><b>it was and where it was coming from. I followed the</b>
<br><b>sound to the bathroom. The first thing that hit my</b>
<br><b>mind was the baby toy. I slowly poked my head around</b>
<br><b>to see what was going on. That horrid plastic thing,</b>
<br><b>was fully animated. It was moving and crying  unlike</b>
<br><b>a real baby.</b>
<br><b>The next thing I knew, I was standing in full view in</b>
<br><b>the doorway of the bathroom. The toilet was actually</b>
<br><b>next to my room, but where I was, was all the way at</b>
<br><b>the end of the hall. It sat on the corner of the bath</b>
<br><b>tub crying, wiping its tears away and then all of a</b>
<br><b>sudden, it looked up at me evilly. (I know this sounds</b>
<br><b>so retarded, but I will explain later). Then it jumped</b>
<br><b>off the bath tub and ran after me, it had something</b>
<br><b>like a knife in its hand. Of course I screamed. I was</b>
<br><b>terrified! I ran all the way down the hallway and into</b>
<br><b>the toilet and shut and locked the door. I was so</b>
<br><b>scared.</b>
<br><b>I put the toilet lid down and sat on it, I didnt want</b>
<br><b>to be touching the floor. The door was shaking and I</b>
<br><b>could hear it outside the door, hitting it. I was</b>
<br><b>hugging my knees to my chest and had my head down.</b>
<br><b>Then it stopped. I stayed in there for a number of</b>
<br><b>minutes, it seemed so long. Then I heard my mum</b>
<br><b>coming. She called out to me. I answered her. She</b>
<br><b>asked me where I was and I told her in the toilet.</b>
<br><b>What is this? she said and then tried the door. She</b>
<br><b>told me to open up, so I did and when the door opened,</b>
<br><b>the doll was sitting on the floor in front of the door</b>
<br><b>and the knife was sitting next to it. Sounds like</b>
<br><b>something out of childs play with Chucky, but this was</b>
<br><b>so real to me.</b>
<br><b>I know so many more interesting stories  more that</b>
<br><b>happened to me, some that happened to my friends,</b>
<br><b>things that happened with me and my friends, but I</b>
<br><b>dont know if I should write about all of them write</b>
<br><b>now. It would turn out to be extremely long. I will</b>
<br><b>write more upon request  though im not sure if you</b>
<br><b>would believe what I just wrote.</b>

<p><b>Cold</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: ken@madisonchemical.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hi there. I am not sure if this is a ghost story or not. I was over
at a girlfriends house sitting on her couch with her having some tea. I
could feel someone watching us and there was no one else in the apartment.
I walked to the front door where I felt like someone was watching us. I
told my friend what I had felt and began to go on a bit of a search. Her
kitchen was to the right of the door (if you came in through it, left to
the door from where I was) and I felt something in there. I walked three
paces into the kitchen and felt a really cold shiver in one spot of the
kitchen. Goosebumps. I went back to where my girlfriend was sitting and
asked her to come with me to the kitchen. I tested the spot I stood in
and before her eyes my arms hairs were standing up. I took one step back
and I was fine. I searched the kitchen for any air ducts and there was
nothing to be found. I asked her to stand in the same spot and sure enough
her hairs were standing. At that point I had a vision of a man in his mid
thirties so we went back to the sofa to talk about this and described the
man I was talking about to her. She looked at me in astonishment, went
in to her bedroom and brought out a picture of a boyfriend of hers that
passed away 3 years and one week short of the anniversary of his death.
The next day I went back to her house to see if I would have the same experience
and sure enough I did. This time though I felt a second presence and once
again described the "vision" I had of this other man. He was older than
the other man and she brought me out a picture of her dead father who was
exactly as I described. There did not seem to be any anger but I did feel
as though I wasn't wanted there and before long I didn't go back to her
or that apartment again!</b>

<p><b>College Story</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: heavensinferno@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>It all started when I went to visit my friend out at college.&nbsp;
I had been</b>
<br><b>kicked out because of not meeting my GPA requirement.&nbsp; My friend
and I had</b>
<br><b>roomed together and I went out to see her for a few days with her
boyfriend.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; She had told us that she had been playing "The Psychic Circle"
with a few</b>
<br><b>of our friends out there and had experienced some weird things.&nbsp;
Her</b>
<br><b>boyfriend was a non- believer and dismissed her experiences.&nbsp;
I had always</b>
<br><b>been intrigued by paranormal activity and believed everything she
said.&nbsp; She</b>
<br><b>suggested that we get together with the owner of the board and see
what</b>
<br><b>happened.&nbsp; This is where it starts to get weird.&nbsp; This
girl claimed she was</b>
<br><b>a psychic but only for fun.&nbsp; We started to play and almost
immediately a</b>
<br><b>"spirit" took over the board.&nbsp; We spoke with several spirits
that first</b>
<br><b>night including my friends boyfriends guardian angel "Waldo" and
my guardian</b>
<br><b>angel.&nbsp; My angel seemed to know too many things ...things that
only i would</b>
<br><b>know.&nbsp; He claimed to know my uncle and knew my grandmothers
first name.&nbsp; We</b>
<br><b>played a few more times in the next few days.&nbsp; While my friend
was in class</b>
<br><b>her boyfriend and I would play on the board.&nbsp; We were sitting
there across</b>
<br><b>the room from each other and he was saying what a skeptic he was.&nbsp;
He said</b>
<br><b>to the room (we were the only 2 there) Waldo if you are really there
let me</b>
<br><b>know.&nbsp; The wind outside howled and he said that wasn't enough.&nbsp;
Thirty</b>
<br><b>seconds later we heard a loud pop over at my friends vanity.&nbsp;
We went over</b>
<br><b>to investigate and saw one of my friends amoxicillan tabs burst
all over the</b>
<br><b>place.&nbsp; We found the psychic and showed her and she giggled
and said it was</b>
<br><b>Waldo and he was sitting in the corner laughing at us.&nbsp; She
said she could</b>
<br><b>see spirits also.&nbsp; My friend had been receiving a spirit on
the board when</b>
<br><b>she was on it that said it was her daughter Dakota from the future
and that</b>
<br><b>she hated her mother for killing her.&nbsp; My friend has 1 healthy
little girl</b>
<br><b>now and she didn't name her dakota due to this.&nbsp; Then another
spirit showed</b>
<br><b>up one evening his name was GED he was a stoner and the psychic
girl said he</b>
<br><b>had been a guardian angel and been demoted so to speak for bad behavior.&nbsp;
He</b>
<br><b>instantly took a liking to me.&nbsp; She told me he was near me
and to feel to my</b>
<br><b>left.&nbsp; I felt and it went from warm to ice cold to warm again.&nbsp;
She said he</b>
<br><b>was smiling.&nbsp; This girl then left the room and we continued
to play.&nbsp; We</b>
<br><b>asked him to prove he was there by taking a drag off my friends
cigarette.</b>
<br><b>The cigarette lit up like someone was taking a drag of from it.&nbsp;
Ged</b>
<br><b>actually touched me and you could see my skin imprint with fingers.&nbsp;
My</b>
<br><b>shirt was pushed up around my waist and you could see him touch
my stomach.</b>
<br><b>He then leaned me back into a position that I could not hold by
myself and I</b>
<br><b>felt cold all around me.&nbsp; I was then .....how do I put this........
molested</b>
<br><b>by a ghost.&nbsp; He laid me on the floor and had sex with me although
I didn't</b>
<br><b>feel penetration my body moved like I was having sex.&nbsp; I was
also spinning</b>
<br><b>in very slow circles while this occurred. I would try to put my
legs down</b>
<br><b>and couldn't due to a force holding them up.&nbsp; My friend and
her boyfriend</b>
<br><b>tried to pull them down (2 people on one leg) and couldn't get them
down.</b>
<br><b>My friend said that all around me felt ice cold.&nbsp; This went
on for 3 hours.</b>
<br><b>My friend found the psychic girl and she entered the room to talk
to him</b>
<br><b>through the board.&nbsp; All he kept saying was things that one
would say during</b>
<br><b>sex.&nbsp; She finally told him to get off me or she would perform
a ritual that</b>
<br><b>would kind of exorcize him in a sense.&nbsp; Two days later we went
home.&nbsp; My</b>
<br><b>friends boyfriend and I bought a board for his house (at a bookstore).&nbsp;
The</b>
<br><b>first time we played with the board Ged appeared and wouldn't let
my friends</b>
<br><b>boyfriend touch the board.&nbsp; It wouldn't move with him touching
it and would</b>
<br><b>try to climb up me. The little glass piece always wanted to touch
me.&nbsp; We</b>
<br><b>played with the board and seemed to communicate with our friend
180 miles</b>
<br><b>away.&nbsp; One night it said farber up in smoke.&nbsp; Farber was
my dorm hall.&nbsp; My</b>
<br><b>friend called a few minutes later and asked if that's what our board
said</b>
<br><b>cause she had just got that same message at the same time.&nbsp;
How did she</b>
<br><b>know?&nbsp; Later that night a fire was started in a garbage can
on another floor</b>
<br><b>and the cause was unknown.&nbsp; I was sleeping and dreamt of what
a friend of</b>
<br><b>mine was wearing when they were evacuated from the dorm.&nbsp; When
my friend</b>
<br><b>called the next day to let me know about the fire I asked what the
other</b>
<br><b>friend was wearing.&nbsp; When she told me I almost lost it.&nbsp;
I started to cry</b>
<br><b>and said that's what she was wearing in my dream.&nbsp; She continued
to have</b>
<br><b>problems with Dakota to the point where she would come in after
class and</b>
<br><b>find her boyfriends jersey on the floor and a mug that was smashed
in half</b>
<br><b>with only one half there.&nbsp; The psychic girl told her that her
mirror was a</b>
<br><b>portal for spirits.&nbsp; And to bless it with holy water.&nbsp;
Before she did this</b>
<br><b>she would come into her room to find it boiling hot leave for 5
minutes and</b>
<br><b>then come back to find it freezing cold.&nbsp; So cold she could
see her breath.</b>
<br><b>She wouldn't sleep there.&nbsp; She blessed her mirror with holy
water and things</b>
<br><b>didn't stop.&nbsp; The psychic girl said the only way to get her
out of my</b>
<br><b>friends life was to have the spirit enter her (the psychic girl).&nbsp;
This girl</b>
<br><b>performed some type of spell and changed dramatically.&nbsp; I don't
know all the</b>
<br><b>details but all I know is she was taken away by a psychiatric hospital</b>
<br><b>because she was trying to hurt my friend with a knife.&nbsp; But
the strange</b>
<br><b>thing&nbsp; is that's where it ends for her.&nbsp; I haven't touched
a board like that</b>
<br><b>since.&nbsp; Our daily lives are pretty much normal and once in
a while something</b>
<br><b>that came up on the board will show up in real life.&nbsp; For example
it told me</b>
<br><b>that I would get involved with a guy and gave me his initials and
kept</b>
<br><b>showing fire.&nbsp; I met a guy 3 months later with the same initials
and he was</b>
<br><b>a firefighter..&nbsp; Weird little things like that.&nbsp; And I
always feel as if</b>
<br><b>someone is watching me.I would love to talk to a psychic but where
I live</b>
<br><b>there are none.&nbsp; Someone tried to tell me I had a gift to be
able to move a</b>
<br><b>glass thingy over the board with out touching it.&nbsp; I don't
know if u have</b>
<br><b>any ideas let me know.</b>

<p><b>Cool Experiences</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: wildmom1@earthlink.net</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Hi, my name is Shari, and my experiences are just little ones, but
really cool, though.&nbsp; The house we lived in before we moved into this
one, which we own, my husband and I and a friend were sitting in the living
talking and watching tv.&nbsp; All of a sudden my husband saw someone go
into the bathroom and he proceeded to call to my youngest daughter, who
was sleeping on the couch behind our friend.&nbsp; He then thought it was
our dog, but she was sleeping under the coffee table in front of his feet.&nbsp;
And our other two children were sleeping over at their aunts house.&nbsp;
He said that it looked like a little girl in a blue dress.&nbsp; After
that he saw her many more times before we moved.&nbsp; Another incident
happened after a friend of ours died.&nbsp; The electric coffee pot would
clog up, and the water would not go into the pot, but would fill up the
basket and spill all over the counter.&nbsp; It had never done that before,
so we just figured it was our! friend who liked to play jokes on people.&nbsp;
Since we moved into the house we are in now, we have seen the little girl
in the blue dress on many occasions.&nbsp; I hadn't seen her until we moved
into this house, but I saw her go into this bathroom.&nbsp; There have
been other incidents since, including, my husband seeing a bearded man
at the end of our hallway, and when he went to investigate it was ice cold
in the spot where the man was standing.&nbsp; There was one more time not
long ago, when my husband was in our room getting ready for work, the kids
were all at the kitchen table eating dinner, and I was sitting in the living
room watching tv.&nbsp; I just happened to glance toward the bathroom for
some reason, and as soon as I looked the bathroom light when on, off, on,
off, on, off.&nbsp; I looked away not sure of what I had seen, and as I
looked back the light did it again.&nbsp; I couldn't believe what I had
seen, and called my husband out of the bedroom.!&nbsp;&nbsp; He came down
the hallway, stood in the bathroom doorway, started to reach up to the
light switch to check it out, and before he got his hand half way up to
the switch, the switch itself moved up, down, three more times.&nbsp; Now,
you may think I am crazy, but you can't go into the bathroom and turn the
switch on and off without someone seeing you do it.&nbsp; You can see our
bathroom from the living room.&nbsp; The real funny thing is, it hasn't
done it since and that was about 6 months ago.&nbsp; I have no explanation
for it, but I know what I have seen.&nbsp; I know these little incidents
aren't as big as the other ones on the website, but I think they are really
cool just the same.&nbsp; I have no doubt in my mind that ghosts exist.&nbsp;
This is a great site in my opinion, and I enjoy reading the stories.&nbsp;
There is also a story in the website, "Ghosts of North Portland", that
has something to do with me.&nbsp; It has to do with the St. John's Bridge.&nbsp;
A g! irl was kidnapped and raped and held under the bridge for a week before
she died.&nbsp; That same girl can still be heard crying, but usually in
the summertime.&nbsp; She was a relative of mine.&nbsp; Her death is documented
in a book that is part of my family history.&nbsp; I just came on the story
by accident.&nbsp; But I think it is really cool.&nbsp; Thank you for taking
the time to read my stories.</b>

<p><b>Critter</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Chas_Kat_Phil@webtv.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp; Something is "living" in my home besides my family, I'm not
sure what</b>
<br><b>it is, but I see it all the time.&nbsp; I didn't have a name for
it at first,</b>
<br><b>but I found one in a issue of FATE magazine I recieved, it was similar</b>
<br><b>to ours and so I started calling him "Critter", becuase what that
person</b>
<br><b>described matched what I am seeing..&nbsp; Critter is a small ball
of pure</b>
<br><b>black aproxiamately the size of a rubber bouncing ball, but with
a</b>
<br><b>somewhat hazy outline.&nbsp; Critters' favorite pastime is zipping
across the</b>
<br><b>floor of whatever room you are in and disappearing into the wall
or</b>
<br><b>funiture, although he has also been known to go across the ceiling
only</b>
<br><b>to disappear into a wall or ceiling fixture.&nbsp; Critter has become</b>
<br><b>friendly I guess you would have to say as now he will glide up the
arm</b>
<br><b>of my sofa or rocking chair and dissappear right where my hand is,
as if</b>
<br><b>he is hiding under my hand, although he is never there when I lift
it up</b>
<br><b>off the arm of whever I happen to be sitting at the time.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I know that</b>
<br><b>this is not something I am imagining, because my mother has seen
him and</b>
<br><b>says that he now flys aroung the room&nbsp; for her.&nbsp; My sister-In-law
has</b>
<br><b>seen him skitter across the kitchen floot and thouht it was a mouse,
but</b>
<br><b>when she described it to me I said "No that''s just Critter".&nbsp;
She was</b>
<br><b>amazed that I was not frightedned by this thing, but Cretter has
not</b>
<br><b>done any harm and I don't feel there is a reason to be afraid of
him.</b>
<br><b>Althought the first time my father saw him he came completely unglued,</b>
<br><b>he does not even like to disscuss paranormal activithy let alone
admit</b>
<br><b>that somthing of that nature is happening to him.&nbsp; He kept
asking "Did</b>
<br><b>you see that , Did you see that??"&nbsp; When i finally got him
to tell me</b>
<br><b>what he saw I told him not to be afraid it was just Critter saying</b>
<br><b>hello.. Well he was amazed at the way I acted as if it was nothing
to</b>
<br><b>have Critter running around.&nbsp; Recently Critter even went visiting,
he</b>
<br><b>followed my mother next door to my brothers' house.&nbsp; I know
because my</b>
<br><b>Siste-In-Law saw him go across her living room carpet.&nbsp; I don't
know</b>
<br><b>what critter is but as long as he doesn't cause any harm to me he
can</b>
<br><b>stay as long as he likes. Anyone else who has had this king of experiece</b>
<br><b>please feel free to E-mail me at this addreess.&nbsp; Thank you
for taking</b>

Eclectic Wiccan, and very open minded, so if you can help at all, I'd be
more than greatful.</b>
<br><b>The first thing I can ever remember was when I was about 5, I stayed
overnight at my Omas (Grandmothers) apartment and she let me have her bed.
I woke up for some reason I can't remember. Looked up at the ceiling and
saw an aparition floating about the fan on her ceiling. I imediatly pulled
the covers over my head and tried&nbsp; to go back to sleep. Now I dismis
this as dream, considering the fact that it was late at night, I was young,
and the figure seemed to look like caspar the friendly ghost. But I remember
it so well, I believe it must have some importance.</b>
<br><b>When I was six me and my mom lived in an Apartment above a post
office, I again was sleeping and went to get up. This time I saw an old
woman who looked like a hag with a puppet, they were speaking on how they
should hurt me. I pulled the covers over my head. Now I again think it
was just my imagination running wild, but it was so terrifing I slept with
the covers over my head until I was ten.</b>
<br><b>I've always been kinda sensitive to the idea of ghosts, my mom is
skeptical but has always raised me to have an open mind and be aware of
my surroundings. All my life I can remember being senstive about being
alone, seeing things I thought weren't there. But nothing believable had
happend to me until I was 13.</b>
<br><b>My mom and Step-dad had left the house to get Ice-cream. I had my
friend over to have a slumber party. She was sitting on the couch and I
was standing in front of it facing the hallway. Suddenly I saw a 3 foot
high shadow race out of our kitchen and down the hallway, I aksed her if
she saw that and she said "You saw it too!" She told me she saw a dark
figure out of the corner of her eye. But I saw all of it. It seemed more
demonish that ghostly.</b>
<br><b>We moved last year to a house 2000 km. away. It was fine at first
but then various things began to happen.</b>
<br><b>The breaker in my parents bedroom would suddenly turn off then on
again. Making our living room light flash. Of course it could have been
a power surge.</b>
<br><b>I saw more shadows out of the corner of my eye, just dark figures
apearing then running off.</b>
<br><b>When I was in bed usually after 11:00 pm, I heard the creeking of
footsteps, up and down the hallway. My parents heard nothing, and it was
not them. I presumed it was mice.</b>
<br><b>But the odest thing of all was when I think I had sleep pharalysis.
I woke up for a drink, since I usually keep a glass of water on my backboard.
But I realized I was in my room but on the floor on the other side. It
got very bright and a man walk out of my closet, grabbed a trenchcoat,
walked in front of me and out my bedroom door. I was trying to figure out
where in my room I was, I could swear I was on the other side for the man
grabbed his trenchcoat from where My bed was, plus I was facing the window
beside my bed. When I realized I was still in my bed. I couldn't move,
then I thought I felt something enter my body, pin me down, and when I
screamed I just got out a gasp of air and it left. I felt very tingly afterward,
and stayed up until morning. While I was lying awake I heard young children
luaghing outside my window. I felt that they were playing tag.</b>
<br><b>I also sense that I had two spirits, a young girl about 5, and an
older man about 50. Plus the shadow.</b>
<br><b>But since most of this can be explained, I would also like to point
out that I'm not the only one. My dog woke up one night I can't remember
if it was before or after the sleep pharalysis. But he began to bark and
growl at the corner of my room where my altar sits. I got him to quiet
before my parents woke up but he continued to mumble to himself, and eye
the corner.</b>
<br><b>Luckily we went on a vacation for two weeks to vist our friends
and family where we used to live. I came back and I no longer hear footsteps,
bangs, or lights flashing on and off, nor do I see things.</b>
<br><b>I guess I'm looking for closure, I want to know for sure what happend,
and If I'm crazy. Both my parents know what happend exept the time I had
sleep pharalysis. My mom just giggles and plays along and my dad pretty
much makes fun of me. Please, if you have any information for me, I'd really
appreciate it!</b><b></b>

<br><b>Attack</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: alphadogie@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hello,I recently visited your website and found it</b>
<br><b>very informative.I've had experiences with seeing or</b>
<br><b>feeling spiritual things since I was three years old.</b>
<br><b>When I was three, I remember one day waking up and</b>
<br><b>seeing these evil black dogs around my crib. I would</b>
<br><b>jump the rails run out and head out the front door</b>
<br><b>screaming. I saw these dogs several times in a period</b>
<br><b>of a week before my parents called our preacher to</b>
<br><b>cast out the spirits that I was seeing.The events</b>
<br><b>started after an aunt of mine who was a into</b>
<br><b>witchcraft visited our home. After the priest came to</b>
<br><b>our house,they were gone.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Throughout my life I've experienced a number of</b>
<br><b>spiritual encounters. Most of the time, I can just</b>
<br><b>feel spirits. Rarely, I've have seen able to see</b>
<br><b>spiritual forces.To be honest, I scares the living</b>
<br><b>daylights out of me.Good, bad..it all scares me. I</b>
<br><b>stopped meditating because the more I meditate or</b>
<br><b>focus on becoming spiritually aware, the more things I</b>
<br><b>experience. I find it disturbing and threatning at</b>
<br><b>times.</b>
<br><b>My latest experience was terrifying to me.I believe it</b>
<br><b>to have been a demonic assult.I'm a registered nurse.</b>
<br><b>I was assinged to sit with this psychiatric patient</b>
<br><b>that was at our hospital. This pt had been on our</b>
<br><b>floor for several days and we had suspected that the</b>
<br><b>pt was possessed and being attack by spirits.She would</b>
<br><b>talk to multiple entities,attack thin air,make aweful</b>
<br><b>faces at whatever she was facing. Feeling all of the</b>
<br><b>negative spiritual energy, I decided to sit outside</b>
<br><b>the room at the door way.At about 11pm, I started to</b>
<br><b>hear all these voices..many,many of them inside my</b>
<br><b>head.AT the same time, I began to feel many, many</b>
<br><b>hands touching me all over.The next few hours were the</b>
<br><b>greatest spiritual challenge of my life.The voices</b>
<br><b>kept saying all sorts of thing,and I began to think I</b>
<br><b>was going insane. For a couple of hour, I experienced</b>
<br><b>part of what that girl was experiencing .Except that</b>
<br><b>she could see them.. I cound not see them .All of the</b>
<br><b>sudden , I began to feel a heavy pressure on my</b>
<br><b>throat, down my throat. They were trying to get inside</b>
<br><b>me.I've never experienced a spirit trying to possess</b>
<br><b>me,but I knew that's what was happening.I found it</b>
<br><b>hard to breath. This is when I decide enough. I</b>
<br><b>attempted not to communicate with them,but they were</b>
<br><b>still trying to come inside my body. It was easy not</b>
<br><b>to communicate with them verbally,but i had to stop</b>
<br><b>mentally.I'm sure I prayed. I don't remember</b>
<br><b>praying,but I'm sure I did because I was scared out of</b>
<br><b>my wits. I was so afraid that i would not bee able to</b>
<br><b>block out their voices. But eventually they let me be.</b>
<br><b>I wanted to go home, but I was afraid they follow me</b>
<br><b>there. So, I stayed.Occasianally, they would attemp to</b>
<br><b>talk to me,but I refused to engage. They stopped</b>
<br><b>touching me,but continued to torture the child.For a</b>
<br><b>few hour,I was drawn into her hell and thought I was</b>
<br><b>insane myself. I found myself wanting to yell outloud</b>
<br><b>for them to leave me,to leave her, but I couldn't.I</b>
<br><b>was at work.I was afraid my co-workers would think I</b>
<br><b>was nuts.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I have no doubt these were demons, and there were</b>
<br><b>many of them. I have had at least two demonic</b>
<br><b>encounters in my life.The first one when i was three.I</b>
<br><b>new even then, that what was in my room was very</b>
<br><b>evil.I've had other experiences, but these two were a</b>
<br><b>different kind. Hopefully, I will experience no</b>
<br><b>more.But, I'm afraid I will.</b><b></b>

<br><b>The Entity</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: thelightsareon@hotmail.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Ok, this is the first time I have ever done this and I'm not much
of a story teller, but I'll try so please bear with me. This is a long
story (and may need to be split up into several stories, feel free to do
so if necessary and just title them Mesquite Stories 1,2 and so on.&nbsp;
As I said, it is a long story as it spans the 40 year period of my life.&nbsp;
My story takes place in Mesquite, Texas and actually begins in 1973 when
my mother married my stepdad and we moved into his house.&nbsp; When they
got married, we, my mother, myself, 2 sisters and brother (my mother had
4 children and he had 2) moved into his 2 bedroom mobile home in the older
part of Mesquite.&nbsp; Since his sons had the bedroom, the 4 of us had
to sleep on roll-away beds in the living room, but later they built on
some extra bedroom to accomodate the large family.&nbsp; To protect them
I will change their names and hope if they ever read this they wont kill
me!&nbsp; Lol!&nbsp; OK, now to the story. For the first few years nothing
ever really happened, or perhaps we didnt notice it as we were pretty social
people.&nbsp; At first it started out with my step brother and I fighting,
literally.&nbsp; I had to cut his wrist once to protect myself when he
suddenly started choking me.&nbsp; At the time I felt like he was doing
it to act "macho" in front of his friends, but thinking back, it wasn't
like him.&nbsp; He was gay and a sissy (no offense to gay people, but he
acted more feminine that I did).&nbsp; I even had to fight his fights for
him in school.</b>
<br><b>Anyway, the entity, or whatever it was, seemed to focus on my youngest
sister who was about 5 or 6 at the time, who Ill call Cassie.&nbsp; Strange
things only happened when she was asleep.&nbsp; She would start talking
in a mans deep voice, threatening my middle sister Lou (Im the oldest).
The voice frightened us as we knew there was no way her squeeky little
voice to go that deep.&nbsp; There was one night when my middle sister,
who Ill call Lou had a friend over for the night.&nbsp; Lou and her friend
were in her bedroom with the door closed, playing music and eating cheese
which they were cutting with a small paring knife.&nbsp; Everyone else
in the house was asleep when Cassie came barging into Lous room with her
eyes closed.&nbsp; She reached for the knife which Lou was holding and
when she jerked back, Cassie, in that deep voice, "said give me the knife,
I want to kill you."&nbsp; Being a little smarter than that, Lou would
not give it to her so Cassie stormed out and sounds of kitchen drawers
could be heard opening and slamming. Worried, Lou locked her door and the
next morning when she came out, Cassie didnt remember anything.&nbsp; Another
time I was in sleeping in Cassies bed as she had fallen asleep on the floor.&nbsp;
Ok, I guess a description of the house is needed for this part.&nbsp; Picture
a long mobile home with 3 extra rooms built onto about hald of one side
of it, adjoining to the main house by one door off of the sons bedroom.&nbsp;
Anyway, Cassie had moved into the sons bedroom as they had both moved out
(my step brothers) and my younger brother, whom Ill call Jr. was in the
corner part while Lou was at the top part of L.&nbsp; Anyway, I had just
laid down in Cassies bed and as I said before, she was asleep in the floor
next to me.&nbsp; My brother Jr was in his bed and Lou was in her room.&nbsp;
We heard a noise from outside so we automatically jumped up when Cassie
jumped up and looked in the direction as well.&nbsp; I got freaked out
because I could see through the wall and was looking directly at our dog
who was outside.&nbsp; At the same time Jr had heard a noise from my sisters
room and looked in time to see her get out of bed, put on her robe, OPEN
THE DOOR and walk out on her way to the restroom.&nbsp; Needless to say,
Jr. freaked as well as he then realized he had looked through her door
to see her.&nbsp; Cassie laid back down to sleep and everything was back
to normal. We told my mother about it, but being the 'I dont believe if
I cant see" kind of person, she didnt believe us.&nbsp; OK, fast forward
a couple of years, a lot of things happened but nothing REALLY weird.&nbsp;
Cassie and Jr were sharing a room at the time, though I cant remember why.&nbsp;
Anyway, I didnt see this but from the look on his face and the experiences
we had shared I believed him.&nbsp; They were sleeping on bunkbeds, Cassie
on top and Jr on bottom.&nbsp; He said he got up to go to the restroom
one night and since he knew his way around he didnt bother turning on the
lights.&nbsp; On his way back he noticed a greenish blue light emanationg
from his room.&nbsp; As soon as he stepped through the door, he saw Cassie
hovering about 6 inches above her bed and this light was all around her.&nbsp;
Scared, almost to the point of screaming, he ran to Lous room and tried
for a long time to waken her so she could see, but she would not budge.&nbsp;
So he crawled in bed with her and stayed there, awake, the rest of the
night.&nbsp; Of course when he told my mother, she laughted and chalked
it up to dreams or over active imagination.&nbsp; Fast forward a few more
years with nothing but lights flickering, doors opening and slamming shut
and only minor occurances.&nbsp; I was married, had a 2 year old daughter
and had rented a mobile home on the same street as my mother.&nbsp; My
brother and sisters spent a lot of time at my house.&nbsp; One day Lou
and Cassie were there with me and my daughter.&nbsp; We were in my bedroom
as the central ac had gone out and the window unit was in my room.&nbsp;
I had been living there for about a year with no strange phenomenon (sp?)
and was happy to be away from it.&nbsp; This day, though, would change
that!&nbsp; Cassie, now around 10 or 11 was being silly and doing "commercials"
for our amusement.&nbsp; She would do commercials, word for word, with
silly voices she had for each one.&nbsp; She was in the middle of "I wish
I were an Oscar Meyer Weiner" when both her feet flew out from under her
and she fell in S-L-O-W motion.&nbsp; At the same time, my daughters doll,
which was laying on my dresser, picked up one arm and one leg and turned
over on its side.&nbsp; Lou and I both saw it and we froze.&nbsp; Ok, trying
to be rational I decided it must have been the vibrations from Cassie hitting
the floor, although we still dont know what tripped her or made her fall
in slow motion.&nbsp; As soon as Cassie stood up, the doll turned back
onto its back and remained still.&nbsp; Cassie was complaining of dizziness
and said she felt like she had been falling forever.&nbsp; As one, Lou
and I both jumped up, I grabbed and left that house.&nbsp; We went to stay
at my mothers until my husband got home.&nbsp; We told him what had happened
and though I dont think he believed us, he went along with it.&nbsp; He
walked me home and stood guard while I tore the head, legs and arms from
that doll and put it in a trashbag.&nbsp; The next morning we BOTH took
it out and watched the garbage man put it in his truck.&nbsp; The next
night it was back sitting on my bed.&nbsp; I freaked, but since my husband
was there I put on a brave front and started tearing the doll apart again.&nbsp;
This time I placed each piece in different boxes that we had stacked on
top of one another on my daughters bedroom closet.&nbsp; Then I closed
and locked the door thinking there was no way it could get out.&nbsp; Wrong.
The next day it was back.&nbsp; Needless to say, we packed up everything
and moved to California. Several years passed with nothing strange happening.&nbsp;
When we came back to Texas, however, that changed. My husband got a job
as truck driever so I had to spend a couple of months with my mother. About
2 weeks later my cousin died and came back to say goodbye.&nbsp; Though
the thought is comforting now, at the time it terrified Lou and I, but
of course my mother still wouldnt believe us.&nbsp; I was grown and would
like to think I had matured but my mother flat refused to believe us.&nbsp;
I guess it was a couple of weeks later Lou and I were talking about how
Cassie used to talk in a mans voice and each had thought it was a dream
or imagination but we both remembered it so we knew we werent crazy.&nbsp;
But nothing had happened in a long time so we wondered.&nbsp; Anyway, one
day my husband was home (at my mothers) and there were a lot of people
there. At least 10 or 12 people, but once again my mother wasnt there.&nbsp;
Cassie decides to do "commercials" but this time she was sitting on the
arm of the couch.&nbsp; As soon as she got to the same part in the song
as last time, she fell backward off the couch, in S-L-O-W motion.&nbsp;
Everyone saw this and just froze.&nbsp; We had told our story but I guess
no one had really believed us, till now!!!&nbsp; Anyway, without a word,
Cassie got up from the floor and walked over to the other couch, laid down
and began masturbating.&nbsp; In front of everybody!&nbsp; We were all
too stunned to do anything for several seconds but finally I went over
and told her to stop it, and she threw her hands up in the air and denied
doing anything like that.&nbsp; I know I didnt imagine it, we ALL saw it.</b>
<br><b>Fast forward a few more years, My husband and I are divorced and
I am living with another man whom Ill call Lee.&nbsp; I realized too late
that he was not the type to work, but once in the relationship I was too
afraid to leave him. He drank a lot of was abusive.&nbsp; At this time
we were living in a rundown motel with kitchenette.&nbsp; Lou was staying
with us as she could not get along with my stepfather.&nbsp; This "room"
was more like an apartment as it had a living room, 1 bedroom, kitchen
and bathroom, in that order as you came in the door.&nbsp; There was 2
doors in the living room, both leading to the same place, my bedroom.&nbsp;
Since there wasnt an overhead light in there, I had bought an old lamp
to sit on the end table.&nbsp; One night, it was Lous birthday, we had
a couple of her frineds over and were taking pictures.&nbsp; On every photo,
regardless of how her head was pointing, Lou had a halo over her head.&nbsp;
Most pictures were group photos, but the halo was very unmistakably over
her head.&nbsp; WEIRD!&nbsp; I had an instamatic camera, the kind that
produced the photo and spits it out immediately so we noticed it right
away.&nbsp; We tried turning off the lamp, all the lights and still, it
was there!&nbsp; At night she would call me and when I would run in there
(she slept on the floor in the living room) she said she could hear a lady
singing in her ear.&nbsp; I laid down and at first could not hear anything,
but then I did and it was such a beautiful, sad song.&nbsp; This was definitely
not a radio somewhere in the building.&nbsp; As soon as you sat up, the
sound was gone.&nbsp; Fast forward a few more years.&nbsp; My "boyfriend"
was finally out of my life, I heard he went to prison.&nbsp; Anyway, I
am remarried. My now husband and I rent an apartment and everything was
wonderful for the first year.&nbsp; One night we were arguing and it was
almost like he became possessed.&nbsp; He got violent and then tried to
rape me.&nbsp; Being the stubborn woman I am, I was trying to fight him
off.&nbsp; All of a sudden the phone started ringing so I managed to get
away and ran to answer it.&nbsp; As soon as I picked it up, I started crying,
then my husband did too.&nbsp; We suddenly realized that we didnt have
the phone turned on yet.&nbsp; I even grabbed the cord and brought it up
to show him, it was not plugged into the wall.&nbsp; He apologized for
his behavior and swears he doesnt know what made him do that, but I know
God or an angel was protecting me that night.&nbsp; We talked about everything
and straightened everything out.&nbsp; as soon as we got into bed, the
rocking chair in our room began rocking.&nbsp; I thanked it and the chair
stopped suddenly and everything was back to normal.&nbsp; Ok, fast forward
a few more years, to the present.&nbsp; There are a lot more things I could
tell you, but I dont want to bore you, besides, Im worried about the length
of my story.&nbsp; About 12 years ago&nbsp; my sister Lou and I were living
together, splitting the rent in order to make it. One night she rented
some movies and my oldest daughter begged me to let her stay up to watch
them with us.&nbsp; Since it was a week night I told her no but promised
she could watch them the next day.&nbsp; A little while later I heard a
noise coming from one of the bedrooms and got up to go check on the girls.&nbsp;
As soon as I rounded the corner I saw the figure of a person, it was blacker
than the darkness in my oldest daughters bedroom.&nbsp; Thinking it was
her sneaking up to watch the movies I got mad and told her to ger back
in bed. Then proceeded to go in there to get onto her.&nbsp; I knew when
the "figure" saw me and watched it run to the other side of the room.&nbsp;
Still thinking it was my daughter I listened for the rattling noise her
bed makes.&nbsp; She slept in one of those old day beds made of brass.&nbsp;
You couldnt touch that bed without hearing those sounds.&nbsp; Anyway,
I stormed into her room and stopped dead in my tracks.&nbsp; My daughter
was in bed fast asleep. I searched under her bed, in her closet, everywhere,
but nothing.&nbsp; I immediately ran into my room to check on my youngest
daughter who was then about a 1 1/2 years old.&nbsp; She seemed fine but
I could still feel my heart beating in my throat!&nbsp; I went in and told
Lou what had happened and she blamed it on the horror movies we were watching.&nbsp;
Nothing else ever happened there. Fast forward another year.&nbsp; I got
a job as an apartment manager in Richardson, Tx.&nbsp; Lou was still living
with me as we both hoped to be able to save some money since I didnt have
to pay rent.&nbsp; Though unmarried, we were both pregnate at this time,
but I later miscarried mine when I fell down a flight of stairs. Anyway,
one night after the girls were asleep I went into my room to read for a
little while.&nbsp; I know I wasnt asleep because I was sitting up in bed
when I felt someone looking at me.&nbsp; I looked up at the door which
was the only access to this room and saw a figure standing there.&nbsp;
I wasnt black or gassy or green as a lot of the storied I have read here
seem to be.&nbsp; This was in the shape of a man in a business suit and
reminded me of, hmm, how do I ex-plain?&nbsp; OK, you know when youre driving
down a long highway in the summer and way up ahead of you it looks kind
of shimmery?&nbsp; Thats what this looked like.&nbsp; Anyway, he just stood
there in my doorway, staring at me while I was staring at him.&nbsp; I
did not feel threatened but was a bit unnerved to say the least.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I&nbsp; began reciting the Lords prayer and saw him shake his head at me,
turn around and walk away. I jumped up to follow him but he was gone.&nbsp;
I asked Lou if she had seen anything, but she hadn't.&nbsp; The next night
the same scenario. I was in my room reading and had just turned off the
light.&nbsp; I was straightening the covers when I heard a noise on the
other side of the room.&nbsp; Jerking my head up, I tried to see in the
darkness but couldnt see anything. All of a sudden I heard a noise that
sounded like tiny feet running of wood and saw something solid on the desk
I kept in my bedroom for personal use.</b>
<br><b>Since the light was on the other side of the bed I yelled for Lou
who came running.&nbsp; I never took my eyes off the object and when Lou
turned on my light, I was staring at a Beetle Juice doll that belonged
to my oldest daughter.&nbsp; How it got into my room I have no idea, but
there it was.&nbsp; As with the other doll, I threw it away, but this one
did not come back!&nbsp; One night a friend and his wife came to spend
the night.&nbsp; In the middle of the night he heard someone talking and
went to investigate. He told me my oldest daughter was sitting up on her
bed, facing the closet, telling whoever or whatewver she was talking to,
to "go away, all you do is get me into trouble."&nbsp;&nbsp; I had been
having a lot of trouble with her not cleaning her room, putting her dirty
clothes all over the house, but assumed it was typical teenage rebellion.
After that, I wondered but never saw anything out of the ordinary that
pertained to her.&nbsp; OK, now fast forward about 10 more years.&nbsp;
Things have been pretty quiet with the occassional "feeling" but nothing
too strange.&nbsp; My oldest daughter in now married and my youngest daughter
is 12.&nbsp; I am divorced AGAIN!&nbsp; They say 3's a charm but thats
not true!&nbsp; Anyway, it is only myself and my youngest daughter here
at this apartment and a lot of strange things have been happening.&nbsp;
We have been here for about 8 months and until about 2 weeks ago, everything
has been quiet.</b>
<br><b>My youngest daughter who I will call Michelle has always been fascinated
with the ghost stories in our family and has been disappointed that she
has never experienced anything. I tried to tell her to be careful what
she wished for but she wouldnt believe me. Now she does! :) I noticed that
my bathroom light bulb has to be replaced about every 5-7 days. That istn
really spooky but I have read that that is a sign for paranormal phenomenon.
One night, I guess it must have been a Friday night, I was in my living
room on my computer and Michelle was in her room on hers. Our computers
are connected by a lan cable so I have to be online in order for her to
be able to chat or check her mail. She loves to go into a kids chat room,
which I will not say the name. Anyway, we both have Yahoo Instant Messenger.
Now for those of you who have it, you know that a name is always beside
the message so people will know who is saying what. Right? Well one night
we were online and all of a sudden she came in here and told me that someone
was calling her a "B" and telling her to "get the F!@# out!" I asked her
who said that and she said she didnt know as there was no name, just the
window. My first thought was that a hacker had figured out how to do that,
but why would anyone want to torment a child like that? Since then lights
have been turning off and on, our bathroom door refuses to stay open and
you can "feel" it in the house. There is also the constant feeling like
you are beingf watched. My daughter wont even take her clothes off when
changing, she slides the shirt over the one she is wearing, then puts her
arms in and pulls the other one off from beneath. Nothing really threatening
has happened except the one time with the instant messages but it is still
uncomfortable. Last night I was once again on my computer when all of a
sudden I felt a cold breeze right next to me. It didnt pass me but stayed
stationary by my left arm. I called my Michelle in here and she could not
feel it. I picked up a kleenex from my desk and held it by one corner.
Her eyes grew to the size of saucers when she saw the other end dancing
around like a wind was blowing it. The windows were closed, the ac was
not on. It was still in here excpet for the movement in that tissue! One
night, my daughter put a cross in my bedroom window (she sleeps with me
now!) thinking it would keep evil away. Then when I went to bed I noticed
it was upside down and freaked! Thankfully she did it, not knowing what
that meant She thought a cross was a cross reagrdless of its position.
I put it back in place right side up and thankfully it is still there!
There are times when you can smell bread rising. I guess its the yeast
that gives off that aroma, but it is unmistakable! I have always heard
that spirits are stationary in a house or personal item, but I dont know
that I believe that. I have seen and heard too many things to think almost
every place I have ever lived was haunted. My story may not be as scary
as some I have read here, but when odd things happen all your life, it
becomes less noticable. One other thing! I and my siblings have always
kept mother informed of our "strange happenings" and she has never believed.
She is retired now and has moved to East Texas to live in the country.
I went to spend the weekend with her a couple of weeks ago and after I
left she told me that the tv in her bedroom turned itself off twice! She
thought it was my nephew (she is raising him, Cassies oldest son) but then
remember he had gone to spend the night with a friend. Now shes not quite
so certain we have been imagining this all these years. If anyone wants
more info or wants to realte their stories, feel free to email me at thelightsareon@hotmail.com.</b>

<br><b>Essequibo Ghost</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: winstonpersaud@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I am from Guyana in the West Indies, which is famous</b>
<br><b>for its paranormal activities.&nbsp; My experience was not</b>
<br><b>a frightening one, in retrospect.&nbsp; However, at the</b>
<br><b>time I was about 10 years old and it truly scared me.</b>
<br><b>My parents, along with my brother and I&nbsp; were</b>
<br><b>attending&nbsp; Hindu wedding of a distant family member in</b>
<br><b>Essequibo, Guyana (This is the rural area of Guyana,</b>
<br><b>with no electricity at various time of the night etc.)</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;The wedding itself was very traditional and</b>
<br><b>extravagant.&nbsp; However, according to the Hindu</b>
<br><b>religious ceremonies, elaborate wedding cakes are</b>
<br><b>forbidden (non-traditional) and should not be part of</b>
<br><b>the festivities. (Many varieties of traditional sweets</b>
<br><b>are fine).&nbsp; Anyway, my brother and I along with a</b>
<br><b>distant cousin we met at the wedding, found some</b>
<br><b>cigarettes which we decided to smoke when everyone was</b>
<br><b>asleep.&nbsp; We got up from the verandah, where we were</b>
<br><b>resting and walked into the living room to take the</b>
<br><b>stairs downstairs.&nbsp; However, as we entered the living</b>
<br><b>room, we saw what appeared to be an old woman with</b>
<br><b>gray hair sitting in a rocking chair staring at the</b>
<br><b>cake.&nbsp; She did not have legs and did not make any</b>
<br><b>movement except for her intent stare at the cake.&nbsp; The</b>
<br><b>three of us were literally unable to walk, it was</b>
<br><b>almost as if we were frozen.&nbsp; The hair on my arm stood</b>
<br><b>on its end.....I felt cold and scared (Essequibo is</b>
<br><b>normally about 80 degrees at night).&nbsp; Needless to say,</b>
<br><b>we never went for that smoke.</b>
<br><b>The next day, I told the story to my mother....leaving</b>
<br><b>out the wanting to smoke part.&nbsp; It was then she was</b>
<br><b>told by our relatives that the grandmother of the</b>
<br><b>groom (who we were not related to) did indeed have</b>
<br><b>long gray hair and lost her legs to diabetes, in her</b>
<br><b>early years.&nbsp; She was a devout Hindu and had died</b>
<br><b>about 10 years before the wedding.&nbsp; The grandson that</b>
<br><b>was getting married was her first grandchild and she</b>
<br><b>was the one who made sure he attended temple and knew</b>
<br><b>about his religion.&nbsp; The cake was discarded after our</b>
<br><b>relatives related the story to the groom.&nbsp; Maybe his</b>
<br><b>grandmother did not want him to deviate from his</b>
<br><b>religion or make a mock of it, or was it the diabetes,</b>
<br><b>I don't know...but it was an experience I will never forget.....</b>

<p><b>Evil Encounters with the Dark Side!!!!!!!!</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: anonymous</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>My family lives in home that was built in the 60's.&nbsp; Our basement
is really</b>
<br><b>dark and does not have very many windows, and even the windows it
has are</b>
<br><b>only 2 feet long by 1 foot high, so they don't allow much light
into the</b>
<br><b>basement&nbsp; allowing for a lot of dark corners and pitch black
rooms.&nbsp; I am</b>
<br><b>not sure other than a cop who actually has lived there before us,
but there</b>
<br><b>have been several encounters with dark entities, spirits or whatever
you</b>
<br><b>chose to call them.&nbsp; When my parents first moved into the neighborhood,</b>
<br><b>there were a lot of rapes, and bad crimes committed, but with the</b>
<br><b>neighborhood's help, that soon became a thing of the past.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
My family is a</b>
<br><b>fairly religious family and very active in our church.&nbsp; There
are 5 children</b>
<br><b>including myself and both my parents.&nbsp; 3 of us have had experiences
and the</b>
<br><b>other 2 children have not.&nbsp; My mother would be the fourth person
in the</b>
<br><b>family out of 7 who has had experiences.&nbsp; I am not a person
who believes</b>
<br><b>everything I hear.&nbsp; I am logical, and I second guess even some
stories</b>
<br><b>myself.&nbsp; I am not someone who plays around with satanic or
demonic things.</b>
<br><b>They have always scared the hell out of me.&nbsp; I am not one who
is crazy and</b>
<br><b>nuts and I am a practical person who needs proof before following
along with</b>
<br><b>anything.&nbsp; When I was young, my mother would tell us stories
about my</b>
<br><b>grandfather seeing an Angel or spirit visit his baby brother's room
calming</b>
<br><b>his baby brother when he was crying.&nbsp; The stories, whether
good or bad,</b>
<br><b>would always scare me because I have never wanted to see a spirit
or ghost</b>
<br><b>or anything of that sort nor have I ever wished for an experience.&nbsp;
I would</b>
<br><b>have rather left that up to someone else.</b>
<br><b>As a child I always felt like I was being watched by someone and
followed.</b>
<br><b>I would run home from my friends homes as fast as I could because
I always</b>
<br><b>felt like someone was at my heels following me home.&nbsp; When
I was 15, I was</b>
<br><b>involved in a church production which was supposed to have a high
turn out.</b>
<br><b>At the time, I was struggling with my religious beliefs and doing
this play</b>
<br><b>had been helping restore my own faith in what I believe.&nbsp; The
night before</b>
<br><b>the first production I went to bed very tired.&nbsp; I slept in
a basement room</b>
<br><b>with a heating duct that went through the length of the room so
the room was</b>
<br><b>always the warmest in the house and nobody ever got cold in that
room.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>went to bed and slept for a few hours.&nbsp; While sleeping, I heard
a taunting</b>
<br><b>voice whisper in my hear, "Try to turn on your lamp."&nbsp; I had
a lamp on my</b>
<br><b>headboard which had a book shelf on it.&nbsp; My sisters would always
do things</b>
<br><b>to tease me and try to scare me because I would always scare them
by jumping</b>
<br><b>out of dark corners at them, so I said, "Leave me alone!&nbsp; Get
the hell out</b>
<br><b>of here or I'll kick your butt."&nbsp; Again, I heard the whispering,
taunting</b>
<br><b>voice say, "Try and turn on your lamp."</b>
<br><b>At this point I was pissed off, so I went to turn on the lamp and
I felt a</b>
<br><b>tremendous pressure hold my arms and legs down to the bed.&nbsp;
I quickly opened</b>
<br><b>my eyes and I saw the room get darker than it had been before.&nbsp;
I felt a</b>
<br><b>coolness in the air and I heard fuzzy noise in my head followed
by</b>
<br><b>whispering voices that would start off slow and get louder and louder
all</b>
<br><b>whispering something different in in a language I was unfamiliar
with.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>heard the voice loud this time, in the midst of the whispers, "Try
to turn</b>
<br><b>on your lamp!!!"&nbsp; I couldn't scream for help, I couldn't move
and I knew</b>
<br><b>whatever was in there was from Satan and not from God.&nbsp; I tried
to think of</b>
<br><b>something religious, Christ, the scriptures, the church something,
but it</b>
<br><b>was really difficult because all I could hear were these whispers.&nbsp;
Finally</b>
<br><b>I felt the pressure leave as if whatever it was jumped off my body
and my</b>
<br><b>arm flew up and knocked over the contents on the top of my headboard/book</b>
<br><b>shelf.&nbsp; With hands shaking and my heart pounding, feeling weak
all over my</b>
<br><b>body, I finally turned on the lamp and still, the room was dimmer
than it</b>
<br><b>had ever appeared and I felt a cold breeze whisk past me and it
seemed to go</b>
<br><b>out in the hall.&nbsp; I was so scared that I set all of my religious
books</b>
<br><b>around my bed and stayed awake all night long.&nbsp; It continued
to happen every</b>
<br><b>so often over the next few weeks and then months.&nbsp; I asked
my dad to perform</b>
<br><b>a religious blessing on the house to cast whatever it was out of
the house</b>
<br><b>and we did, but it kept coming back.&nbsp; Each time it would do
something</b>
<br><b>different.&nbsp; It would put pressure on my legs, or arms.&nbsp;
It would pull at my</b>
<br><b>feet.&nbsp; Or I could just feel it standing there staring at me.&nbsp;
In my head I</b>
<br><b>knew what it appeared as, a Scorpion Face with red eyes.&nbsp; I
knew that wasn't</b>
<br><b>its true form, but that is how it scared me, so I would never open
my eyes,</b>
<br><b>but just pray and pray and pray and eventually turn on the light
and stay</b>
<br><b>awake all night long.</b>
<br><b>After a few encounters, I decided I wanted to move upstairs, so
I switched</b>
<br><b>bedrooms with my older sister who stayed there until she got married.&nbsp;
One</b>
<br><b>night, as her fianc&eacute; was putting her to bed and leaving they
walked in the</b>
<br><b>room and they saw something move.&nbsp; They looked up in the corner
and saw an</b>
<br><b>evil looking lady hovering in the top corner of the room staring
back at</b>
<br><b>them with an evil grin as if to let them know she would do anything
to gain</b>
<br><b>control.&nbsp; They both prayed, and the lady left.&nbsp; I later
found out that as a</b>
<br><b>child, my sister had had a similar experience to mine where she
was held</b>
<br><b>down and heard the whispering getting louder and louder, but when
she was</b>
<br><b>young, the voice told her he would get her someday.</b>
<br><b>After high school I moved away for a while to Brazil and my younger
sister</b>
<br><b>moved into my room because it was the biggest in the basement.&nbsp;
While she</b>
<br><b>was sleeping down there, one night, she felt something hold her
legs and</b>
<br><b>arms down and she heard the whispering spirits again get louder
and louder</b>
<br><b>and described it as radio fuzz but with voices saying things in
a demonic</b>
<br><b>language.&nbsp; When I returned home after a couple of years, I
returned to a</b>
<br><b>different room in the basement and never had experiences, but until</b>
<br><b>recently, still felt like someone was always watching me from the
doorway or</b>
<br><b>the hallway as it sat at the bottom of our stairs waiting for something.</b>
<br><b>Sometimes I still feel its presence, but I have since learned that
I have</b>
<br><b>more power and control over it than it does me, so I have not been
bothered</b>
<br><b>since I have come to this realization.</b>

<p><b>Evil Spirit</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: c5clancaster@Hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I did not believe in evil spirits until it happened to me and my
two roommates.We moved into this house in the country in austin, tx.It
was where there was a terrible massacre in the 1800's by commanche indians.What
was weird is that the house had brand new furniture and it looked like
someone still lived there.So I asked the owner if it was furnished,he&nbsp;
told me that the man who moved in, lived there for only three weeks and
moved out in the middle of the night.Well it didn't take long to find out
why.Three day's after we moved in i was laying on the couch it was around
12:00 am.All of the sudden it sounded like claws ripping the glass of the
window right by my head.I jumped up and ran outside.There was nothing there
and we had flood lights around the house and it was lit up pretty good,so
i went back in the house and went to bed, and as soon as i laid down,something
very large was like dragging itself up to my window and stopped.I ran toward
's the hall and one of my roommate's heard it too and was in the hall,so
we went outside and looked around and nothing was there.After that i would
not sleep in my room.five day's later one of my roommates came into the
living room with his blanket and pillows and said at first he didn't believe
me until it started dragging itself up to his window, and he would be waiting
by the window and would look out and nothing would be there.He said it
would do it over and over every night,but tonight he said it came into
his room and he said his room got cold and all of the sudden a glass of
water he had on the shelf flew across the room breaking a foot above his
head.I knew he was telling the truth because he had glass in his hair and
i heard it also.The next night my other roommate moved into the living
room telling almost the same story.We would hear things falling off of
shelves and strange noises coming from our bedrooms at night after we moved
into the living room. whatever it was it did not want us there.We moved
out after one month.I think that the man who lived there before us saw
the evil spirit.That's why he left almost everything he owned there.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Ex-boyfriend</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Bullridercrazy@cs.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>About a month ago my boyfriend and I had a fight and he had broke
up with me</b>
<br><b>over the fight we had (since then we have gotten back together).
A while</b>
<br><b>before he and I broke up there was edvince of a ghost in our my
house.&nbsp; My</b>
<br><b>bedroom door had opened by its self a time or to, the back door
opended for</b>
<br><b>my mom to go out side when there was no one out there, and my mom
has heard a</b>
<br><b>voice calling mom assuming it was me she came to see what I wanted
and when I</b>
<br><b>told her it wasn't me she belived we had ghost while my brother
and dad</b>
<br><b>denied this we knew it was true.&nbsp; I would say about 1 or 2
a.m. of the night</b>
<br><b>me and my boyfriend had broke up I woke to a sound of something
falling and</b>
<br><b>landing in the middle of my floor.&nbsp; I got up to investagate
and found the</b>
<br><b>rose my ex had given me in the middle of my floor.&nbsp; I knwe
this had to be</b>
<br><b>done by ghost because the rose was on top of my dresser with the
other roses</b>
<br><b>my best friend had given me and none of the roses she had given
me had ended</b>
<br><b>up on the floor.&nbsp; I belive the ghost did this because he was
angry with my ex</b>
<br><b>for breaking my heart since we have gotten back together I have
had some</b>
<br><b>situations with the ghost opening my door but his rose remains on
my desser</b>
<br><b>untouched.</b><b></b>

<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I love this web-site, it's awesome!!!! i
have read alot of the stories</b>
<br><b>here, and i&nbsp; have a couple of my own.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Back in 1994-95 my then boyfriend and daughter
(8) lived in an old house</b>
<br><b>that we did alot of remodeling to it was a two story and we turned
the second</b>
<br><b>story which wasn't very big into one big bedroom, and this is where
my</b>
<br><b>experience happened, my then boyfriend was out of town and my daughter
was at</b>
<br><b>her fathers house so i was alone and had gone to bed around 11:00
or so and</b>
<br><b>was awaken out of a dead sleep around 2or3am lying on my back it
felt like i</b>
<br><b>was paralized and i heard what sounded like power lines buzzing
but it was</b>
<br><b>loud i also heard what sounded like papers being shuffled and people</b>
<br><b>whispering after a min or so i fell back to sleep i did not feel
threatened</b>
<br><b>or afraid, and i was again awaked by the same sounds but this time
there</b>
<br><b>seemed to be a male voice right in front of me, he asked me a question
or</b>
<br><b>said something to me but i could not understand what he said, but
i remember</b>
<br><b>saying NO loudly and everything quit and i fell back asleep and
that was the</b>
<br><b>first and only time that ever happened to me.</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My second story happened a month ago in
april 2001 it's june 3rd today.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;This is a very sad story i'm about to tell you but it</b>
<br><b>gives us all hope that there is life after death!!&nbsp; My ex-husband
and i have</b>
<br><b>been divorced for 8 yrs., and in 99 i remarried and moved to a town
about 15</b>
<br><b>miles or so from where my ex and i lived but my ex and i remained
very good</b>
<br><b>friends and saw each other all the time after all we have a beautiful</b>
<br><b>daughter together, well a couple of yrs ago he (my ex) became very
ill (heart</b>
<br><b>attack) he was 39yrs old&nbsp; and after his first heart attack
his kidneys also</b>
<br><b>failed so he was very&nbsp; very ill but he made it through and
was getting a</b>
<br><b>little better each day then 4 months after his first heart attack
he had a</b>
<br><b>second heart attack and again we almost lost him but he pulled through
and</b>
<br><b>lived for a year and a half (not much of a life) he suffered horribly
in that</b>
<br><b>year and a half, well this past April 5th he passed away just before
his 41st</b>
<br><b>birthday his b-day is April 16th, our daughter was 12 she just turned
13 May</b>
<br><b>21st anyway it&nbsp; was very difficult for both my daughter and
i even though we</b>
<br><b>knew he didn't have much time left, my daughter and i was at the
hospital</b>
<br><b>along with all his family and friends (he has a large family) and
lots of</b>
<br><b>friends and i am still very close to all his family and friends,
anyway the</b>
<br><b>next day after he passed i was at his house looking for some paper
work and</b>
<br><b>saw the answering machine blinking so i checked the message and
it made the</b>
<br><b>hair on my arms stand on end because the massage sounded garbbled
(thats the</b>
<br><b>way my ex sounded toward the end of his life) because of the heart
attack and</b>
<br><b>stroke it left his speach messed up it was very hard to understand
what my ex</b>
<br><b>was trying to say and that is exactly what the message on the answering</b>
<br><b>machine sounded like and that message was left about 12hrs after
my ex passed</b>
<br><b>away, one of his life long friends also got 3 messages exactly like
that on</b>
<br><b>his machine within days after my ex passed. then the day after the
funeral i</b>
<br><b>went back to work and i always set my coffee pot the night before
so my</b>
<br><b>coffee is ready when i get up at 5am but that morning i came down
to get my</b>
<br><b>coffee and it was not ready so i was checking out the coffee machine
and the</b>
<br><b>time on the clock was an hour behind ?&nbsp; how did that happen?
so i hit the</b>
<br><b>switch and started the coffee got ready for work (power had not
gone off) all</b>
<br><b>the other clocks were fine anyway later that day when i got home
for work i</b>
<br><b>checked the time on the coffee maker and the time was correct? other
things</b>
<br><b>have happened to other family members too, one sister of his i'am
very close</b>
<br><b>to said she thought she saw him walk through her living room. I
for one am a</b>
<br><b>strong believer in the after life and i loved him very much and

<br><b>Fable and Tales</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:jonb@swl.co.uk</b><b></b>
<p><b>To whom it may concern,</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I write to share with you some tales I've been
told and maybe verge on some of the experiences I have, unfortunatley I
have no pictures of any apparations for you.&nbsp; However, I know of one
which I shall keep to myself, which expresses a large orb which can not
be examined but which is believed by members of my family to dipict the
essense of my late grandfather, within an area of my parents garnden dedicated
to his memory.&nbsp; Incidently the picture was taken to a "medium" by
my uncle whom without prompting said it was a man, standing with a yellow
or golden dog.&nbsp; The dog owned by my grandfather prior to his, then,
current dog was a golden retriever.&nbsp; That dog had died over a decade
before.</b>
<br><b>Alas I digress, I write to ask if you could find out some things
for me or maybe become interested in them to futher your research.&nbsp;
A while back (approx 1995) a television programme was produced by Channel
Four here in England, which was to do with the three oldest public houses
(bars) in Nottingham.&nbsp; Nottingham being my home town.</b>
<br><b>Indeed, I saw the filming of the programme and was in two of the
pubs at the time of filming.</b>
<br><b>The film was made as part of the "Time Team" series of programmes
specifically "History Hunters" and visited the pubs listed on a portion
of my web site:</b>
<br><b>http://members.theglobe.com/jbond6/travel/nottm/pubs.htm</b>
<br><b>Now all these pubs are very old (I believe all three are older than
the United States of America - great tourist haunts), indeed they reside
within striding distance of Nottingham Castle, in particular in one pub
(the Salutation Inn) has plaques listed of two regulary sighted ghosts.&nbsp;
Incidently the Salutation Inn was the rally point for Royalist soldiers
at the English Civil War started in Nottingham when King Charles I struck
his battle banner in the main grounds of Nottingham Castle (That original
castle was later destoryed by Oliver Cromwell at the end of the war to
stop it becoming a sight of rally for royalists after the King was beheaded).</b>
<br><b>Anyway, Rosey is one of the ghosts who reside in the Salutation,
she moves within the entirity of the building, and whom I think I may have
met, she is known for putting lost coins around people, indeed I felt a
penny placed in the leg of my trousers which could not have got there any
other way. Though these cases are rare, rosey is known for her mischief,
and when the filming of the programme I mention was taking place in the
Inn, on two occasions filming had to be adandoned.&nbsp; As the camera
would not work.</b>
<br><b>The crew got a spare camera and filmed the stripping down of the
original, when it was opened two penny pieces (1 pence coins) were found
within the mechanisms of the camera.&nbsp; Once these were removed the
filming continued.&nbsp; However the camera placed on a table again suddenly
ceased working, after again stripping it down a twenty pence piece was
found in the mechanism.</b>
<br><b>This was documented on the film and broadcast with the programme.&nbsp;
However, in the room at the time of filming and caught on the sound recordings
of the room was a little girl giggling.&nbsp; I heard this apparation,
as did other members of the public and the film crew. However, this we
were told would not be broadcast as it may upset certain people's sensibilities.
(Remember this was in a public house upstairs, where no children are allowed).</b>
<br><b>I would like to find this footage and find that sound recording,
and I wondered if you may be able to help.</b>
<br><b>Incidently, I may appear to be a Crank or a Nut, but do not fear
I am a crank and a nut, but remember "Those who know they're insane are
the sane one's, it is those who do not know, and need reassuring we have
to worry about" - Sigmund Frued. (can't spell). Kind Regards</b>
