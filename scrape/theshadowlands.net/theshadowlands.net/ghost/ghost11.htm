<P>
<P><B>My husband and I were coming home from our honeymoon and we stopped
by </B>
<P><B>his grandfather's home on the way back to our home.  We stayed the
night </B>
<P><B>because it was late.  My husband and I slept in a second bedroom and
his </B>
<P><B>grandfather slept in his own.  We layed down and tried to sleep.  About
</B>
<P><B>ten or fifteen minutes went by and I heard a woman's voice.  It </B>
<P><B>said,"Good-night Harold."  My husband's grandfather is Harold.  I laid
</B>
<P><B>there for a few minutes terrified not knowing whether to say anything.
 </B>
<P><B>My husband then asked if I just heard something.  I said "yes, did
you?" </B>
<P><B> He said he heard a woman say "Good-night,Harold."  In the morning
we </B>
<P><B>asked his grandfather if he had an intercom or gotten a phone call
or </B>
<P><B>anything or heard anyone the night before and he said that he hadn't.
 </B>
<P><B>We never told him what we heard.  My husband's grandmother had died
many </B>
<P><B>years before,  was it her?</B>

<H3><A NAME="aunt linda">Aunt Linda's House</A>
</H3><P><B>by brian@erols.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>Well, knowing that my family has had a rocky past with ghosts in </B>
<P><B>different places they've lived, it was no wonder that as soon as I</B>
<P><B>discovered this page my family would start bringing up some stories.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I found one that really intrigued me, for the simple fact that it was
</B>
<P><B>my favorite place to stay during the summer, my Aunt Linda's house.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Her house was, at one time, a two family house, but when she bought
the </B>
<P><B>place, they opened the house up.  In the upstairs, there was a
hallway</B>
<P><B>connecting the two halves of the house and a small room at the
center.</B>
<P><B>This room, for a long time, was my uncle's bedroom, (her younger </B>
<P><B>brother).  While cleaning up the house, they had found an old rocking
</B>
<P><B>chair in the attic.  He had taken it and put it in a corner of his
room, </B>
<P><B>using it as a reading chair during the night.  One night, after </B>
<P><B>basketball practice, he lay down on his bed, across the room from the
</B>
<P><B>rocking chair and fell asleep.</B>
<P>
<P><B>About three in the morning, as he recalls, he woke to the sound of
</B>
<P><B>squeaking.  Turning his head ever so slightly, so not as to frighten
his </B>
<P><B>sister, as he was sure it was her coming to check on him one last time
</B>
<P><B>before she went to work, he caught the rocking chair in mid-rock. 
</B>
<P>
<P><B>Shaking his head and trying to clear the sleep from it, he slowly sat
up </B>
<P><B>and watched as a smoky figure of a woman crossed from one doorway and
</B>
<P><B>sat down in the chair, a foggy bundle in her arms.  As she sat and
</B>
<P><B>rocked, he began to hear the faint sounds of humming, singing.</B>
<P>
<P><B>He leaned forward, straining to hear what she was saying.</B>
<P>
<P><B>He smiled as he heard her say, "It's okay Johnny, mama's got you now,
</B>
<P><B>sleep my little love."  And fell back to sleep.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>He later told his older sister about it and she nodded saying, "Yeah,
I </B>
<P><B>guess some lady's baby son died of scarlett fever here a ways back.
 It </B>
<P><B>must be her rocking chair.  We can get rid of it if you want."  He
only </B>
<P><B>shook his head no and said, "Nah, I thought it was sweet..."</B>

<H3><A NAME="uncle victor">"Uncle Victor"</A>
</H3><P><B>by otistj@nextdim.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>My wife and I grew up in a small town in southern Idaho.  The place
is</B>
<P><B>normally quiet, with the exception of migrant farm workers bringing
in</B>
<P><B>some excitement in the summer and during harvest.  At least it is on
the</B>
<P><B>outside.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I had dated my wife in the mid-80s--we married in 1995--during that
time</B>
<P><B>my wife's family lived in a house way out in the country. All the
times</B>
<P><B>I took her home, she never invited me in.  I thought it was me--might</B>
<P><B>have been--but there is another explaination.  Before they moved into
it</B>
<P><B>it had been vacant for approx. 3 years.  Perhaps this is the reason
why.</B>
<P>
<P><B>One morning as she awoke from spending the night on the couch.  She
got</B>
<P><B>up to use the bathroom and returned to the couch and laid down.  She</B>
<P><B>heard bells tinkling, which seemed to be moving towards her.  She felt
a</B>
<P><B>presence in the room, a bad one, and she looked up far enough to see</B>
<P><B>what appeared to be the legs of her uncle Victor.  The thing was
being</B>
<P><B>mean to her verbally--only it was speaking extremely fast and</B>
<P><B>nonsensical, it was speaking in gibberish as far as she was concerned.
</B>
<P><B>She ran to her parents bedroom and told them about the incident, and
how</B>
<P><B>the thing reminded her of Victor.  Her mother got on the phone and</B>
<P><B>called Victor in California to try to settle her down and show her
it</B>
<P><B>was alright.  Things weren't quite right for quite awhile in that
house.</B>
<P>
<P><B>These encounters happened about once every five weeks for five years.
</B>
<P><B>Always they began with the sound of bells.  When she heard the bells
she</B>
<P><B>knew she was in trouble.  The entity seemed to get off on her fear.
 It</B>
<P><B>would enter the room and ring bells over her head, sometimes small</B>
<P><B>tinkling bells and sometimes loud cowbells.  It would laugh at her
in an</B>
<P><B>evil way.  It got to the stage where it would touch her--pushing her</B>
<P><B>down into the couch with enough force to hold her there so she
couldn't</B>
<P><B>move.  One time she said it pushed the back of her head into the</B>
<P><B>couch--'til it felt like my face would rip'--and put something that
felt</B>
<P><B>and sounded like a power drill into the back of her head.  On one</B>
<P><B>occassion it tried to pick her up off of the bed.  She felt arms go</B>
<P><B>under her neck and knees.  She prayed like a maniac and it finally
left</B>
<P><B>her alone.</B>
<P>
<P><B>No one really believed her when she told them what was going on.  A</B>
<P><B>particular friend of hers didn't believe her until she spent the
night</B>
<P><B>in the house.  She woke up in the bedroom to the sound of bells and
saw</B>
<P><B>three men at the foot of the bed laughing at her.  She got up and ran
to</B>
<P><B>her car and left the scene.  She would never enter the house again.
But</B>
<P><B>she believed.</B>
<P>
<P><B>One of my sisters in law was up early one morning making a lunch for
a</B>
<P><B>school outing.  She went into the other room to meat a bowl of cereal</B>
<P><B>and watch TV, but kept hearing a scraping sound.  She thought that
it</B>
<P><B>was one of the family in the kitchen and went back to doing her thing.
</B>
<P><B>When she went into the kitchen, she saw that all the chairs had been</B>
<P><B>moved into the center of the room.  She woke the whole family up--no
one</B>
<P><B>was up at the time.  She belived, too.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Most of the family recalls being in the TV room (where most of the</B>
<P><B>activity happened) and getting the feeling that something was in the</B>
<P><B>room with them.  Sometimes everything was fine and then,all of a
sudden</B>
<P><B>the room got a heavy, wierd feeling.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>No one in her church would believe her either.  She told them on
several</B>
<P><B>occasssions, and the attributed it to the imagination of a seventeen</B>
<P><B>year-old.  Finally, they ended up accepting the fact.</B>
<P>
<P><B>You see, there was another woman down the road about 1.5 miles that
was</B>
<P><B>having the same trouble.  The reason that they believed it from her
is</B>
<P><B>because her husband saw the thing pick her up once.  It seems that
the</B>
<P><B>skeptics needed another witness.  After the house was blessed, they
had</B>
<P><B>no more visits from uncle "Victor".</B>

<H3><A NAME=calvary>The Restless Calvary of the Confederacy</A>
</H3><P><B>by OMAGIC@worldnet.att.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>Lets see it had to be almost a year ago since it happened.  My name
is David </B>
<P><B>and for the past couple of years a group of friends and i began night
</B>
<P><B>patrolling major civil war battlefields in central Virginia. We were
hired </B>
<P><B>to watch out for relic hunters and things out of the ordinary on these
</B>
<P><B>historic sites. Anyway like I was trying to say was in the first couple
of </B>
<P><B>weeks into september of 1995 my co-workers and I were called out to
do a </B>
<P><B>late patrol around the Five Forks and Cold Harbor areas.  It was about
2:00 </B>
<P><B>a.m. we got a call over the radio about figures in one of the battlefields
</B>
<P><B>nearby so me and my partner take the call. We get to the entrance hop
out of </B>
<P><B>my truck and look around.  I guess we spent 7 minutes out in the cold,
then </B>
<P><B>we heard the sound of people running of into the woods from the center
of </B>
<P><B>the field.  The sound was very clear considering there were no other
sounds </B>
<P><B>being the dead of night.  The figures appeared to us off in the distance
and </B>
<P><B>we yell for them to stop.  With no sign of their acknowledging us we
radio </B>
<P><B>for help and it arrives instantly.  We instructed them to wait at the
</B>
<P><B>entrance while we drove around to the backside of the park to cut the
</B>
<P><B>figures off.  On the way to do so, we saw a white haze.  Me thinking
</B>
<P><B>thinking nothing more of than snow falling from the trees wanted to
continue </B>
<P><B>but my partner who had become frantic by this point demanded for me
to stop. </B>
<P><B> Not knowing why I killed the headlights and pulled into the side entrance
</B>
<P><B>for park officials and killed the engine.  It grew deathly quiet again
and </B>
<P><B>it was like that for about five minutes  then we saw yellowish/orange
</B>
<P><B>flashes off in the distance I knew that they were musket flashes. Having
</B>
<P><B>never seen them before only hearing local legends my heart begins to
race </B>
<P><B>and I get out of my truck. My partner scared out of his mind gets out
also. </B>
<P><B> The closer we walked towards the center of the field the flashes became
</B>
<P><B>more and more. We began to hear deep rumbling booms(coming to find
out later </B>
<P><B>that it was ghostly cannon fire).  Just as fast as it had started it
endend </B>
<P><B>and became deathly quiet again, a quiet I had never known up till that
</B>
<P><B>point.  Then we began to hear grunts, clanking metal, coming from the
mist </B>
<P><B>and then we began to hear the sound of steps, many steps slow ones
and quick </B>
<P><B>ones and we heard the snow crunch underneath them. As the mist grew
closer </B>
<P><B>we could make out figures of mounted men dressed in gray of civil war
</B>
<P><B>military dress.  As one became visible more became visible and more
and </B>
<P><B>more.  They stopped moving.  My partner and I were witnising a calvarly
of </B>
<P><B>spirits before our eyes.  We looked at them and they looked at us and
we </B>
<P><B>could not move.  Then someone called on the radio for me from the front
of  </B>
<P><B>the park and as I went for it one of the spirits yelled "stop right
there!" </B>
<P><B>so I did.  Nearly to the point of craping all over myself five of the
</B>
<P><B>figures ride up to me four of the spirits stayed back about fifteen
feet and </B>
<P><B>one rode directly up to me.  He climbed off of his horse and approached
me. </B>
<P><B>He looked me straight in the face and glanced at my partner then looked
back </B>
<P><B>at me, peered over the left shoulder of my jacket which a had confederate
</B>
<P><B>battle flag patch sewn on the sleeve.  The spirit looked back up at
me, </B>
<P><B>mounted his horse and rode back to the others along with the four that
rode </B>
<P><B>over to us with him.  The spirit looked back one last time and the
calvary </B>
<P><B>rode off and vanished.  We walked over to where they were and not hoof
or </B>
<P><B>footprint was to be found and so ends this story.</B>

<H3><A NAME="neighbors story">A Neighbor's Ghost Story</A>
</H3><P><B>by littlewing@worldnet.att.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>We are a young couple who recently moved to New York City to attend</B>
<P><B>school.  Upon moving into our apartment at 120 MacDougal St (#19),
we met</B>
<P><B>and became surprisingly quick friends with our neighbor, Shashi, who
lived</B>
<P><B>across the hall from us. During one of our many dinners together, he</B>
<P><B>commenced to tell us of the true events that happened to him, the summer
of</B>
<P><B>1995.</B>
<P><B>        A little history on the layout of his apartment - like so
many</B>
<P><B>buildings in Greenwich Village, ours was constructed sometime during
the</B>
<P><B>1700's.  Shashi has been fortunate enough to have held this apartment
in his</B>
<P><B>family for the past 30 years but, subsequently, it has not been
refurnished</B>
<P><B>in quite a while.  The walls are exposed bricks ,and the toilet is
old</B>
<P><B>enough to still have the tank mounted on the wall several feet above
the</B>
<P><B>toilet bowl itself.  The apartment is basically a 1 bedroom, with the
wall</B>
<P><B>separating the bedroom from the main room having been torn down in
the mid</B>
<P><B>'70's.  The story begins.</B>
<P><B>        Shashi told of being in his bedroom last summer and, along
the</B>
<P><B>course of about 3 weeks, being basically tormented by these "ghosts."
 The</B>
<P><B>only reason I put ghosts in quotes is that the tormenters were not
always in</B>
<P><B>human form, as I always imagine ghosts to maintain.  He told of a
greenish</B>
<P><B>light floating outside of his bedroom window (we live on the 6th floor
of a</B>
<P><B>7 floor building)  For safety reasons, no one is allowed onto the roof,
but</B>
<P><B>the light freaked him so, that he went to the roof and peered over
to where</B>
<P><B>his window looks out to other buildings, and saw nothing.  When walking
back</B>
<P><B>to his apartment, the light was there again.</B>
<P><B>        Shashi told of waking in the night to hear voices arguing,
only to</B>
<P><B>notice two dwarfs fighting with each other.  Apparently, when the
dwarves</B>
<P><B>found out that they had been discovered, they seemed to include Shashi
in</B>
<P><B>their arguments: they would run over him while he tried to sleep; they
would</B>
<P><B>try to take his pillow out from beneath his head; they continually
pulled</B>
<P><B>his hair, so much to the point that friends of his would ask what
happened</B>
<P><B>to his head, that a lot of the hair was gone from a certain area.</B>
<P><B>        Shashi told of waking several times in the night only to discover
a</B>
<P><B>progression of what seemed to be circus animals walking through his
bedroom.</B>
<P><B>They seemed to come from some part of the main room, and exited through
an</B>
<P><B>indention (that normally does not exist) near the window of the
bedroom.</B>
<P><B>The animals were one of the most real parts of this whole scene, for
he</B>
<P><B>could actually feel the movement of air and their fur as they passed
by him.</B>
<P><B>        Shashi told of hearing sounds, incredibly loud sounds that
seemed as</B>
<P><B>if someone had composed a tapeloop of nonsense words strung together.
 The</B>
<P><B>loop that played most often had something to do with animals, but he</B>
<P><B>couldn't remember exactly what it said.  These tapeloops played for
up to 3</B>
<P><B>hours every night and got so bad that his next door neighbor called
the</B>
<P><B>police screaming at the top of her lungs because "the noises wouldn't
stop."</B>
<P><B>Unfortunately, she would never talk about anything else she might have
seen</B>
<P><B>or heard.</B>
<P><B>        Shashi told of watching television late one night in complete</B>
<P><B>darkness. He moved to turn the bedroom light on, and what he described
as a</B>
<P><B>"greenish hazy cloud" jumped at him, forcing him back into his bed,
and</B>
<P><B>eventually out of the apartment for the next 2 months.  When he
returned,</B>
<P><B>everything was as it had been before these events, and nothing has
happened</B>
<P><B>since.</B>
<P><B>        Have you heard of anything like this, specifically relating
to the</B>
<P><B>whole circus scene?  Shashi said that it was as if some animals had
been</B>
<P><B>tortured or held illegally in his apartment some time ago.  I know
that the</B>
<P><B>Village, being one of the older sections of New York, has some good
folklore</B>
<P><B>and ghost stories, but I haven't read of any relating to animals of
any</B>
<P><B>kind.  Anything you have to say on the matter would be much
appreciated.</B>

<H3><A NAME="upstairs hallway">The Upstairs Hallway</A>
</H3><P><B>by dpickfor@mn.uswest.ne</B>t
<P>
<P> <B>Okay, I'm not very good at this, so bear with me. My house is
haunted.</B>
<P><B>To put a finer point on it my upstairs hallway is haunted. When I was
young</B>
<P><B>I slept in a bedroom upstairs but I have since then moved to the
basement</B>
<P><B>because it terrifies me to walk down the stairs from my bedroom to
the main</B>
<P><B>floor. </B>
<P><B>    When I was young I thought for sure that Dracula was standing on
the</B>
<P><B>upstairs landing staring at me as I went down the stairs. It was like
he was</B>
<P><B>silently threatening to jump on my back and suck all the blood from
my body</B>
<P><B>and leave me dying and watching in vain while he killed the rest of
my</B>
<P><B>family. That's the closest I can come to explaining the feeling
decending</B>
<P><B>the stairs gave me. But what was I supposed to do? My bedroom was up
there,</B>
<P><B>I suppose I could have slept on the couch but I still would have to
go</B>
<P><B>upstairs because the only bathroom was up there. So my only solution
was to</B>
<P><B>go down the stairs with my back to the wall so I could see both ways.</B>
<P><B>    One night when I was about 13 years old I awoke to see a either
a woman</B>
<P><B>or a man with long blonde hair sitting , just chillin, on the floor
with his</B>
<P><B>back to the wall opposite my bed. I closed my eyes, and opened them
again.</B>
<P><B>The figure had vanished. This time I wasn't scared at all.</B>
<P><B>    My father tell me about a time when he was sitting in the living
room</B>
<P><B>reading. It was about 3:00 in the morning and everyone else was asleep.
My</B>
<P><B>dad said he felt a sudden freeze come over his body, he couldn't move.
Then</B>
<P><B>he heard  a shrill scream coming from the top of the stairs. At this
point</B>
<P><B>he must have blacked out or something because the next thing he remembers
he</B>
<P><B>is waking up the next morning...IN HIS BED UPSTAIRS. </B>
<P><B>    When I was 15 my family renouvated the basement so I could sleep
down</B>
<P><B>there. I left the upstairs with a smile on my face, never to return.
But I</B>
<P><B>get the feeling that whatever is in my house (at least part of what's
in my</B>
<P><B>house) has moved to the basement with me. This is okay with me though</B>
<P><B>because as of yet whatever is down here has not scared me at all, it
even</B>
<P><B>makes me feel safe sometimes. The reason I think that something may
have</B>
<P><B>followed me downstairs is this, a) My room is next to the laundry
room,</B>
<P><B>there are two entrances to the laundry room. One is through my room,
and the</B>
<P><B>other is next to the stairs leading to the main floor. THE DOORS TO
THE</B>
<P><B>LAUNDRY ROOM ARE ALWAYS OPEN. I'll close one, walk ino the next room,
come</B>
<P><B>back, and the door will be open. The only time they (as in the ghosts)
will</B>
<P><B>allow the door to remain shut is when I am sleeping. And even then
it is</B>
<P><B>only the door in my room that stays shut. </B>
<P><B>    So tell me, what in God's name is in my house? Why do they focas
their</B>
<P><B>attention on me? How do I get rid of them? What happened in my house
to</B>
<P><B>warrant such activity? Help me?</B>

<H3><A NAME="haunted apartment">Haunted Apartment</A>
</H3><P><B>by 2501@johnny</B>
<P>
<P><B>Although the address above is Larry Perkins, this contribution comes
from </B>
<P><B>his roommate, Terrie Wallace.</B>
<P><B>About five years ago, I was living in a small studio apartment in </B>
<P><B>Pocatello, Idaho located at 431 South 9th Avenue #3.  I lived there
for </B>
<P><B>eight years, and all in all it was enjoyable.  It had been an old house,
</B>
<P><B>that had been converted into apartments, and in its youth during </B>
<P><B>Pocatello's younger years, had been owned by a well to do family- my
</B>
<P><B>little abode had been the maid's room. </B>
<P>
<P><B>The building had four apartments, one downstairs, one up, and two on
the </B>
<P><B>side, plus a small house in back.  It was very much in a college </B>
<P><B>neighborhood, and so new tennants were frequent.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>One night when one the basement apartment tennants were moving out,
they </B>
<P><B>had taken a load of things over to their new abode, and came home to
find </B>
<P><B>the lights on, and a mop in the middle of the living room- which hadn't
</B>
<P><B>been there before they left.  The house had had some plumbing problems,
</B>
<P><B>and their basement apartment had had some water during one of our </B>
<P><B>SouthEast Idaho winters, however at the time of the move, during summer,
</B>
<P><B>that problem had also been fixed. The former tennants came roaring
to my </B>
<P><B>door wanting to know if I had heard anyone going in downstairs or seen
</B>
<P><B>anyone. I not only hadn't, but there were no sounds of footsteps emenating
</B>
<P><B>from the downstairs apartment whatsoever.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Several weeks later after the apartment had been vacated, and re-rented,
I </B>
<P><B>went to bed and later that night was awakened by the sound of footsteps
</B>
<P><B>downstairs.  The new tennants weren't home, and later there was a sawing
</B>
<P><B>sound.  I was petrified, and told one of the other neighbors about
it who </B>
<P><B>had some reservations about what I had told them.  The next night I
heard </B>
<P><B>it again.  I didn't believe in Ghosts at the time, but that was a little
</B>
<P><B>close for comfort.  The second time, the sound was right underneath
my </B>
<P><B>bed.  I turned the light on, it stopped, I found myself even calling
the </B>
<P><B>local police department thinking someone had gotten in, as well as
the </B>
<P><B>neighborhood watch people in my area- a citizens crime control group-
</B>
<P><B>thinking it might be juveniles or something.  Later on, I began to
receive </B>
<P><B>phonecalls with no one on the other end, came home from work to find
</B>
<P><B>favorite jewelry broken, and being a Christian believer, also found
a </B>
<P><B>couple of religious oriented things I had, including a special little
</B>
<P><B>cross on a neckchain I had gotten  from a retreat I went to gone.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The entity, whoever, whatever it was then proceeded three years ago
to </B>
<P><B>make itself known in a very pronounced way one late fall night.  I
had </B>
<P><B>been at home watching TV, and my cat, a very lovely black Tabby/Persian
</B>
<P><B>with gorgeous long hair began to act strangely.  Suddenly Gabriel's
eyes </B>
<P><B>went red, and he pranced back and forth in front of the couch on which
I </B>
<P><B>was sitting, moving backwards, and forwards meowing in highs and lows
as </B>
<P><B>if trying to tell me something.    I went to calm him down and he grew
</B>
<P><B>very aggressive.  I was alone at the time,and rather frightened of
being </B>
<P><B>scratched badly, so backed off in fear. I was going to call the neighbors,
</B>
<P><B>and the second the thought entered my mind, he began to calm down,
coming </B>
<P><B>up and purring, and rubbing against me.  He was not an agressively
</B>
<P><B>tempered cat, and very loveable. This only happened once, then he was
back </B>
<P><B>to his normal easygoing, well-tempered mannerisms.  The entity chose
never </B>
<P><B>again to make itself known via poor little Gabby- thank heaven!  Shortly
</B>
<P><B>after that, two weeks before Halloween, I happened to let Gabriel out
to </B>
<P><B>play and he never came back.  There are teens in our area who engage
in </B>
<P><B>occultism, and I can't help but think that was what had happened. 
 I told </B>
<P><B>these things to a friend out of town who has read about paranormal,
and </B>
<P><B>studied it a little, and was gently told whatever was going on wasn't
the </B>
<P><B>result of any juvinile delinquent, or someone in the neighborhood-
and </B>
<P><B>that the harassment I seemed to be encurring was from someone... dead!
 </B>
<P><B>The hair on the back of my neck went straight up, and I about fell
in a </B>
<P><B>dead faint while I was on the phone!  However during that time, I also
</B>
<P><B>noticed some changes in my own behavior- I became rather edgey of course,
</B>
<P><B>and people who knew me also said I wasn't the same person they knew-
</B>
<P><B>almost paranoid, and at times it was as if I was in contact with </B>
<P><B>something- which bothered me no end- it was almost like ESP or alot
of the </B>
<P><B>other things I don't believe in at all.   I sought the help of a minister
</B>
<P><B>who wondered about what I was telling him, and even went to a psychologist
</B>
<P><B>wondering if it was all me.  In the psychologist's view- I had indeed
had </B>
<P><B>some traumatic experiences, but I was fine.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>One night I went to bed to hear sounds downstairs again- this time
right </B>
<P><B>under my kitchen sink like pipes being knocked on.  I got up, checked
the </B>
<P><B>window of the downstairs apartment which was right below mine, and
to my </B>
<P><B>horror found no one at home.  This time, however after my conversation
</B>
<P><B>with the friend I had had, and alot of frustration of telling people
what </B>
<P><B>was going on and only getting nowhere, with the exception of my friend,
I </B>
<P><B>took matters into my own hands.  I took my hand put it on the door
of the </B>
<P><B>cabinet located under the kitchen sink and said "In Christ's name,
whoever </B>
<P><B>you are, whatever you are, leave."  The sound stopped, and I didn't
have </B>
<P><B>problems again with that particular one.  I began to delve even deeper
</B>
<P><B>into my Bible, and also put a few little things up on my walls I had
found </B>
<P><B>at the Christian bookstore- focus points on Christ if you will, it
all </B>
<P><B>seemed to help, and the sounds seemed to disapate a little, much to
my </B>
<P><B>relief.  I was however after that plauged by the persistant entity
by </B>
<P><B>things I would read standing out to me as if something were trying
to </B>
<P><B>continue to communicate.  At that time, I would usually quietly start
to </B>
<P><B>do Breath prayer- a one sentence prayer one develops by visioning Christ
</B>
<P><B>standing in front of them asking what they most need at that time,
- i.e. </B>
<P><B>in that case, "Lord, thy peace," after doing this the things standing
out </B>
<P><B>while I was reading the paper, or whatever seemed to cease a little.
 </B>
<P>
<P><B>Later my landlord, who had obtained a Realtor's license came by during
the </B>
<P><B>time I was chatting with her, she began to tell a little of the house's
</B>
<P><B>history.  Aparently, as I mentioned it had been owned by a well-to-do
</B>
<P><B>family in Pocatello's early history.  It had also caught fire when
the </B>
<P><B>gentleman was in bed with a cigar, and had been rebuilt.  Several times
</B>
<P><B>after I had come home in the evening I smelled... Cigar Smoke.  As
she </B>
<P><B>went on, things suddenly began to click, and several things that had
</B>
<P><B>happened soon became a little close for comfort.  The disapperance
of my </B>
<P><B>cat, and the red eyes, broken jewelry, a neckcross missing, I still
don't </B>
<P><B>understand, but the cigar smoke, the footsteps, the sawing sounds-
all </B>
<P><B>seemed to make sense.  I felt something there several times as well,
but </B>
<P><B>it never felt threatening- except the incident with the cat.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>the current house I am living in also has had a couple of things happen.
 </B>
<P><B>I found out that once an elderly gentleman lived here who had a </B>
<P><B>heartattack and died in the basement.  We have a renter downstairs
who has </B>
<P><B>a sleeping room and one day he said he thought he heard a scraping
sound- </B>
<P><B>I heard it too and low and behold it sounded as if it were coming from
</B>
<P><B>where the current gas furnace was.  My roommate and I had taken the
coal </B>
<P><B>furnace out, and put a gas one in.  I later found out the gentleman
had </B>
<P><B>had the heartattack while cleaning the furnace, and was found by his
wife.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Once or twice I sensed something in my room, a cold, unassuring presence.
</B>
<P><B> I have since then put a picture of Christ on the vanity, and it seems
to </B>
<P><B>have dissapated- much the same as the Author of the Webpage did when
the </B>
<P><B>Bible was put in view, and the house blessed.  This too sent me scuttling
</B>
<P><B>from a Staunch Methodist, to an Episcopalian, where I grasped onto
things </B>
<P><B>like House blessings, Icons, Christian Meditation, etc., which Methodists
</B>
<P><B>never partake of, and have also deeply felt their healing!</B>
<P>
<P><B>Thank-you for allowing me to tell my own story-</B>

<H3><A NAME="camp zama">Camp Zama</A>
</H3><P><B>by anonymous</B>
<P>
<P><B>During the 1980's I was stationed as a Chaplain Assistant</B>
<P><B>at the US Army Post of Camp Zama Japan.  The army post is </B>
<P><B>a small one, 25 miles South West of Tokyo.  Before being</B>
<P><B>an American Army post, it was a Japanese Army post.  For </B>
<P><B>a brief period it was also contained the Emperors horse </B>
<P><B>stables.  At the end of WWII, in order to "save face" many</B>
<P><B>Japanese officers committed suicide on the post.  Also, </B>
<P><B>the emperors horse stables burnt down killing all the horses</B>
<P><B>and the caretaker and his wife.  The American military, who </B>
<P><B>won the war, came in and rebuilt the post - including the</B>
<P><B>American Army chapel.  As time went by, this history of </B>
<P><B>the post was forgotten.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I worked in the chapel.  We had five Chaplain Assistants, </B>
<P><B>four Chaplains, and 4 Japanese nationals working in </B>
<P><B>the chapel and adjacent offices.  We never "saw" what was</B>
<P><B>haunting the chapel - but you could definately feel the</B>
<P><B>hatred toward us Americans.  The Japanese nationals said</B>
<P><B>they never felt anything, and would work by themselves</B>
<P><B>in the building.  The Americans were always feeling someone</B>
<P><B>standing next to them with hatred directed towards them.  </B>
<P><B>Or we would be working at our desk and "just know" someone</B>
<P><B>was standing there watching us, wanting us to go away.  It </B>
<P><B>wasn't until some of us decided to look up the history of</B>
<P><B>Camp Zama that we learned of all the suicides and deaths.</B>
<P>
<P><B>ALSO when the Americans won the war and started sending troops</B>
<P><B>over to Camp Zama, the troups brought their families.  There</B>
<P><B>was no room for the families to build houses, so the Americans</B>
<P><B>moved a Japanese cemetary and built American Housing at the </B>
<P><B>American Military housing complex known as Sagami-hara.  </B>
<P><B>Numerous times people saw "lights" moving between the houses</B>
<P><B>and heard invisable people rummaging around their houses. </B>
<P>
<P><B>It would seem that the dead Japanese Military from WWII don't </B>
<P><B>like the enemy who won coming onto their military posts </B>
<P><B>and Americanizing things.  The invisible hatred directed </B>
<P><B>towards some of the Americans was very real. The dead</B>
<P><B>Japanese also don't seem to appreciate having their final</B>
<P><B>resting places moved.  I can't blame them.</B>

<H3><A NAME=plagued>Plagued by Ghosts</A>
</H3><P><B>by gotr@alltel.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>I , myself, have been plagued for years by ghosts.  I saw my first
ghost</B>
<P><B>when I was five. I was sleeping and woke up to find a lady in a green
gown</B>
<P><B>with long red hair looking at me. She said"Shh... it will be alright."
A</B>
<P><B>few weeks later I almost died from anemia.</B>
<P><B>    I have now, in my home, something I call Annie. She likes to
throw</B>
<P><B>things at me, hides things(only to have them turn up where I left
them</B>
<P><B>days&amp;weeks later). We see a green glowing mist, and hear voices
of</B>
<P><B>children, whispering to each other in the hall.</B>
<P><B>    I have moved a total of five times and Annie is still with us.
Next</B>
<P><B>year, we will move again and I know she'll come too.</B>
<P><B>    My dead ex-mother-in-law has even decided to pay me a visit. Once
on</B>
<P><B>the night she died(just last April). And once on New Years Eve (1995).
The</B>
<P><B>night she died I heard a scratching outside the transom window of the</B>
<P><B>bathroom. The window is seven feet off the ground. The next morning
I found</B>
<P><B>out she had been found dead in the bathroom at the time I heard the</B>
<P><B>scratching. On New Years Eve, me and my daughter were playing with
modeling</B>
<P><B>clay, when I sensed my dead ex-mother-in-law. I knew it was her because
I</B>
<P><B>get this feeling around certain people. And since she and I were not
on</B>
<P><B>good terms, I got that feeling like a fight was going to start. I knew
she</B>
<P><B>just came back to see her grandchild and really couldn't begrudge her
that.</B>
<P><B>     We have expierenced what is known as "The ghostly arrival". The
night</B>
<P><B>my step daughter came up missing, my husband had to go to his mothers
to</B>
<P><B>make all the phone calls to the cops and his lawyer. Me and my friend</B>
<P><B>Melinda were waiting for him to come home. We heard his car pull up
in the</B>
<P><B>drive way, heard him walk up the steps and open the door, but he
wasn't</B>
<P><B>there! Ten minutes later it happens all over again, but this time he
was</B>
<P><B>there! I even had dreamt of my step daughter disappearing two days
before</B>
<P><B>it happened. A year later, I find out that her mother didn't run off
with</B>
<P><B>her on a bus like they said,  but had gone by plane, just like in my
dream.</B>
<P><B>At the time I told my husband of my dream, and he didn't put to much</B>
<P><B>emphasis on it. But had he called the airport like I told him to, we
would</B>
<P><B>have found my step daughter the next day, instead of two months
later.</B>
<P><B>     I am a believer in the supernatural. I also respect this thing
they</B>
<P><B>call ghosts. I also believe that we can all see ghosts and expierence
the</B>
<P><B>supernatural if we go into it with an open mind. </B>

<P>
<P><B>I trust you will find this short story interesting. In its self when</B>
<P><B>told to others there is not a great content. You may from your own</B>
<P><B>experiences find that people treat the subject with either shock
horror</B>
<P><B>or dull disinterest, lacking any lasting and meaningful wonder, which
in</B>
<P><B>my case has lasted twenty years and will no doubt continue throughout</B>
<P><B>the remaining of my life.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The occurrence center around the one house we lived in some twenty
years</B>
<P><B>ago, in the rather ordinary suburb of Wood Green in North London.</B>
<P><B>Neither before that time nor since has there been any repeat or</B>
<P><B>different phenomenon.</B>
<P><B>While sleeping with my wife I was awoken by a pressing presents that</B>
<P><B>came from the window corner of the room. Upon opening my eye I could
see</B>
<P><B>the presents of a young teenager girl of about eighteen with black
hair</B>
<P><B>and very beautiful. The striking effect was in fact the party style
of</B>
<P><B>dress, which was an incredible translucent blue. The image did not
move</B>
<P><B>but seemed to belong there. There was never any fear or panic just
a</B>
<P><B>wonderful sense of beauty. As I was watching I felt that the time was</B>
<P><B>not following a normal passage but somehow held on the moment.</B>
<P><B>My wife was now also wake and I ask her could she see it, which she
say</B>
<P><B>she could. My wife later describe the color but not much other
details.</B>
<P><B>That is about it, the image faded and we went back to sleep but I
shall</B>
<P><B>never forget the experience which was out of the normal sense of being.

</H3><P><B>by dominicc@mgl.ca</B>
<P>
<P><B>Now, a cemetary is an obvious place to look for ghosts, but this is
a </B>
<P><B>sighting none the less. Last winter I was visitng relatives in a </B>
<P><B>different town. My family and I were driving from my aunts house very
</B>
<P><B>late one night. The city we were in is up in northern Canada so it
was </B>
<P><B>absolutely freezing out. We were chatting and listening to the radio
</B>
<P><B>like any family does during a car ride. We turned onto a long street
</B>
<P><B>that lines the whole graveyard in this city, when all of the sudden
my </B>
<P><B>sister noticed the speedomiter was going haywire. The dial on it was
</B>
<P><B>spinning around continuasly for no reason what so ever,and there was
</B>
<P><B>nothing actually wrong with the car, and we were still driving at the
</B>
<P><B>same speed. We were all very puzzled at this when I spotted something
</B>
<P><B>out of the coner of my eye in the graveyard. I looked and it was a
woman </B>
<P><B>just standing in the graveyard starring at the road. The woman didnt
</B>
<P><B>seem to be illuminated but I could see her very clearly in the darkness.
</B>
<P><B>She was short, had shoulder length hair, and was wearing just a dress
</B>
<P><B>despite the bitter cold. We finally passed the graveyard and the </B>
<P><B>speedomiter went back to normal. We have never had any trouble with
it </B>
<P><B>since.</B>
<P>
<P><B>	 Now your probably thinking the woman in the graveyard was just </B>
<P><B>a visitor, or perhaps a caretaker- but her presence did not make any
</B>
<P><B>sence because no visitors are supposed in the graveyard late at night.
</B>
<P><B>The gates of the graveyard were closed tight, and I did not see any
</B>
<P><B>vehicals parked in the driveway. The final reason for me to think her
to </B>
<P><B>be of the supernateral was because she was wearing just a dress in
the </B>
<P><B>freezing weather. But what I really wonder about is why this spirit
had </B>
<P><B>strayed, had something terrible happened to her? Was she trying to
</B>
<P><B>communicate with us? I guess I'll never know because no one has seen
her </B>
<P><B>since.</B>

<P>
<P><B>Hi.  My name is Chris Hardwicke, I am a senior at Southern Oregon </B>
<P><B>State College, and I am currently living in my parents' house in Klamath
</B>
<P><B>Falls for the summer.  I have had the feeling that ther were forces
at </B>
<P><B>work in this house as far back as my freshman year in high </B>
<P><B>school(1989-90).  It didn't really seem to have much of a physical
form </B>
<P><B>until more recently.  If you all know what I mean, it was just a </B>
<P><B>"feeling" for a long time.  It often seemed as if someone was looking
at </B>
<P><B>you, and you had to constantly look over your shoulder, or I would
wake </B>
<P><B>up at night unexpectedly with the bad feeling that I was being watched.
 </B>
<P><B>	These forces seemed to manifest themselves more physically as the
</B>
<P><B>years went by.  I have never actually seen anything, but I have heard
a </B>
<P><B>lot.  The most notable time was when I was downstairs by myself at
about </B>
<P><B>12:30am one night about a year ago.  I was watching some TV when I
</B>
<P><B>started to hear knocking on the wall behind me.  I dismissed it for
a </B>
<P><B>bit, but it kept happening.  I started to get concerned, but tried
to </B>
<P><B>keep a level head.  Then I started to think to myself "If it's really
an </B>
<P><B>intelligent mind doing this, it will do something I recognize."  About
</B>
<P><B>three minutes later, I heard the classic door knock behind me.  You
know, </B>
<P><B>KNOCK-knock,knock,knock-KNOCK.  This utterly freaked me and I decided
to </B>
<P><B>get out of there.  I since heard more knocking, but no more knocks
I </B>
<P><B>recognize.</B>
<P><B>	Just recently, I discussed this with my mother.  She says she has
</B>
<P><B>experienced similar things.  We both agreed that the store room behind
my </B>
<P><B>bedroom is a focal point for this energy, if you will.  We have not
</B>
<P><B>decided it it's really good or evil.  We really don't know.  After
</B>
<P><B>reading this, tell me what you think.  Is my house really haunted?
 If </B>
<P><B>so, is it good or evil?</B>
<P>
<P><B>	Interesting post scripts to this story also.  I have SEEN ghosts </B>
<P><B>at my college.  Some of the buildings there are very old, one of which
</B>
<P><B>used to be an old dormitory.  There are documented cases of deaths
in the </B>
<P><B>house as well.  It has been decided by many supernatural experts that
the </B>
<P><B>house contains an evil, tortured soul.  We saw it one night when we
were </B>
<P><B>walking the campus.  We walked to the back of the house to peer into
the </B>
<P><B>only window that had some light coming out of it.  It was a light green
</B>
<P><B>light cast by one of those exit signs.  Well, we looked through this
</B>
<P><B>window for a few minutes, and before our eyes, a sort of "3D-shadow
</B>
<P><B>figure" stepped in front of the window and peered back out at us. 
We all </B>
<P><B>saw it and later described it.  It had a rough outline of a human being
</B>
<P><B>but it moved slowly and laboured.  This is my only real sighting of
a </B>
<P><B>spirit, and this one was DARK, believe me.  Anyway, it is an experience
I </B>
<P><B>will never forget.  </B>
<P><B>	</B>
<P><B>	To sum up, ghosts do exist.  It is a subject that we as a race </B>
<P><B>may never truly understand.  We must simply respect it, and know of
it's </B>
<P><B>existance.  And for those gifted enough to peer into that world that
not </B>
<P><B>all of us can, spread the word.  Teach people.  I tell my stories,
and it </B>
<P><B>has turned a few heads.  Take care.</B>
