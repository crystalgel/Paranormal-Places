Proprietary House<br>
By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nyr1199@comcast.net <br>
Just wanted to start off by saying that I love your site. Was on your
list of haunted places in NJ and saw the Proprietary House in Perth
Amboy is listed there. I am a trustee with the house and we conducted a
major investigation of the house in December, and found more than we
bargained for. As for what your site says, in the year-plus that I have
been working at the house, I have heard stories of the little boy
(always in blue) but never heard anything about him pointing to the
third floor. If anything, the third floor was where it is *rumored* he
got pushed from a window, by his uncle, before falling to his death. We
know he died at the house, we are just not sure how. My friend's niece
has actually talked to him (he appears to children, in full-bodied
form). I have included a link to the investigation (we did others, but
this is most recent.) If you care to read the others, and ones I
conducted at the Spy House in Port Monmouth, please click the
paranormal tab at the top of the page. If you would like any more info
on the Prop House, please let me know.&nbsp;

St. Anthonys Hospital Woodhaven Queens<br>
<br>
By:&nbsp; Anonymous&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>

Hi I worked for verizon and had to work in St. Anthonys Hospital
several times in the early 80,s and there was still clerical work going
on, just on the 1st floor. I had to work in the basement where the
telephone terminals were. There were many catacombs and 3 morgues and a
sub basement that i found by accident. All the marble slabs and
surgical tools were still in place. A couple of times I saw shadows of
someone walking when I went to look no one was there and almost all the
time you heard voices and screams. After the first time I never went
alone.<br>

Orbs and Out of Body<br>
By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vondersa3@aol.com<br>
&nbsp;<br>
I also wondered if you wanted to hear about an "out of body experience"
I had when I was 4 or 5 yrs. old. You didn't mention it so here it
goes.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
Back in 1968 or 69', We moved into a house, it was two stories with an
attic and basement. We were told that Mr. Shelton had shot and killed
himself in the basement, the people who owned it before us told my
mother this ( I think we were just renting this house). So how long ago
this had happened I am not sure and who Mr. Shelton was is beyond me, I
was a small child and don't remember. But the house ended up being
haunted. Countless things happen to all of us,( eight kids and my
mother. ) My older sister had a bedroom with vinyl curtains for her
door. They pulled together and latched and of course I could not reach
this latch. So the challenge was on, (kid stuff), for some crazy reason
I wanted to shut those doors and latch' em by myself. I drug something
over to the opening to stand on and pulled them shut and latched it,
but when I went to unlatch it, it was stuck and so was I. Locked in
this room all by myself, in this haunted house where being alone in any
room was scary. I lost it, I started screaming and crying for help. My
mother and three of my brothers came to the door and told me to shut
up, they would get me <br>
out. They kept telling me how to open the latch but I was so scared Mr.
Shelton was going to get me. I couldn't do anything but scream
and&nbsp; cry uncontrollablly. I wanted out of that room so bad, the
next thing I know, I am standing on the other side of our dinning room
table,(my sisters room was right off of the dinning room) looking at
the backs of&nbsp; my mother and brothers. They were trying to open the
door with a butter knife and they were yelling at me to quit crying and
I could hear myself crying too! But out there in the dinning room I
wasn't scared or crying, just watching them as they tried to get the
door opened. I remember just standing there, I had one hand on the
backrest of the chair and the other on the table. I was there maybe one
minute at the most and then all of a sudden I was outside of the house,
way up in the air looking down at the window of the bedroom I was
locked in. And I saw myself walk up to the window to look out and I was
still crying uncontrollable. But once again, while I was up in the air
I wasn't scared or crying, Just watching myself. This lasted seconds
then the next thing I know I am standing back in the room on whatever I
had to reach the latch, crying, and the door was opening. My family had
gotten me out and of course whipped my butt for messing with the
door.&nbsp; I don't remember walking to the window, I could see and
hear myself but had no consciousness of myself in the room while I was
out of it. The reality or what was real was me out of the room. Oh let
me say this right...? When I was out of the room, that is were my mind
was. I was not in both places at the same time, so whatever happen in
that room with me while I was experiencing the out of body thing is
beyond me.. I wasn't there I was in the dinning room and outside. This
happen during the day. I did tell my mother how I was outside the room,
standing at the end of the table watching them. I even told her who was
standing where and who was using the knife to open the door. She had no
comment. I am in my 40's now and have only told one other person. They
didn't believe me either. So I have kept quit about it. All the other
"Out Of" experiences I have heard of seem to happen with people who
have died. Which this is not what happen with me, I was just so
terrified. I am not lying or making any of this up, it's nice to be
able to tell someone who won't think (Hopefully) I am not lying, just
really confused about why and how this happen? It has never happen
again. Only that on time. Thanks for letting me tell you,&nbsp; <br>

Strange Visitor<br>
By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; RonR@dbsa.org&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
Good evening. Last week I was in church returning to my seat after
communion. I turned around do see a man who appeared to be in his early
30s. We smiled politely at each other and he proceeded to sit&nbsp;
next to me. 1 second later I turned to see that this strange man had
disappeared.&nbsp; I thought nothing of it and returned home.&nbsp; I
was walking down the hall way and something made me turn around and
again I saw the same man. He smiled, and for some reason I smiled back.
He then headed into the kitchen. I followed and there was nobody
there.&nbsp; The house had been securely locked and the alarms were on.
The security cameras were all turned on and functioning correctly.
There is no sign of anyone else in the house apart from myself. However
on one tape a kitchen chair moves quite a distance back by itself. The
chairs in the kitchen are quite large and heavy. I do not see how the
wind could have moved it.&nbsp; Since then I have seen the strange man
on 2 separate occasions. Once standing in the middle of the road
outside my house. Again in my house watching me work with great
interest. Again I was unfazed by his pressance, we smiled politely at
each other as always, I continued work and when I looked up he was
gone. This is freaking me out something fierce&#8230;<br>

Tallahassee Florida<br>
By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; colarguns@hotmail.com&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<br>
&nbsp;<br>
I was thinking about my dog last night, as he was put away a few years
ago, and the immediate remembrance of a very weird experience me and my
dog had in my home&nbsp; in Tallahassee came about.&nbsp; This home
(prior to any construction behind us), was all wooded landscape and ran
into Lake Jackson.&nbsp; Within this wooded area were several Indian
burial mounds.&nbsp; One day, shortly after I moved there for a new
job, I took my dog for a walk (unleashed) back in those woods.&nbsp; I
saw these mounds but really did not know they were Indian burial
mounds.&nbsp; My dog and I both walked over these mounds just being
adventurers.&nbsp; When I returned from our walk, my neighbor asked me
jokingly if I had let my dog run loose back there, and my response was
yes.&nbsp; He then stated that I would see a black bird perched
somewhere soon in a tree close by, and that this bird would be watching
me.&nbsp; I laughingly asked why, and he said that if we walked over
those mounds, we could have possibly wakened the spirits, and that the
bird was their watchful eye on me.&nbsp; Well, of course I thought this
man was crazy, but he was actually a very nice and intelligent man as I
learned later.&nbsp; So only about 2 days later, I returned home from
work, and I recall thinking about the black bird bit he told me.&nbsp;
So I peeked around the left side of the home to look into the wooded
area, and low and behold there was a black bird perched on a tree
STARING at me!&nbsp; He would not take his eyes off either!&nbsp;
Needless to say that was creepy.&nbsp; So that very night, I was in my
office and my dog was usually laying in the living room by the
fireplace.&nbsp; As I was doing my work in the office, my office chair
was budged about 2-3 inches forward with a force that felt like someone
actually pushed the chair!&nbsp; I instinctively reacted by looking
over my right side &#8220;expecting&#8221; to see my dog.&nbsp; No dog!&nbsp;
Nothing!&nbsp; So I quickly went into the living room only to see my
dog laying down facing the hallway entrance (which is where my office
resided, as well as two other bedrooms), and he had his head between
his paws staring and GROWLING at something in the hallway!&nbsp;
Talking about getting freaked out!&nbsp; So I grabbed my dog by his
collar and tried to lead him into the hallway, and he resisted every
attempt.&nbsp; He was scared obviously, and he DEFINITELY saw or sensed
something.&nbsp; I did not see anything at all.&nbsp; As I walked into
each room through that hallway, I did not see or sense anything.&nbsp;
Then I walked into the bathroom in the master bedroom to find that my
candle (which was lit) was out.&nbsp; So that night I kept ALL lights
on!&nbsp; The following day I came home and looked again for that weird
bird, he was not there.&nbsp; So I took my dog outside to do his thing,
but then I noticed he was limping, and then he fell to his side with
pain in the back yard.&nbsp; As I made observation, I noticed that in
his groin area, he had a large tumor like bulge coming from this
area.&nbsp; I immediately took him to the veterinarian, and I recall
she had no explanation for it, but prescribed medication to reduce the
swelling.&nbsp; Within two weeks or so the swelling went away.&nbsp;
Looking back at that, I really feel that that spirit (or whatever it
was) made that happen, as my dog was still young and very
healthy.&nbsp; After that week of weird occurrences, I never had
anything further happen.&nbsp; I never told my neighbor what had
happened, as I did not want to look silly or have rumors flying
around.&nbsp; But for sure, I can tell you that I know in my own gut
that what that neighbor told me came to life!&nbsp; Dogs can definitely
sense or see these spirits, as we cannot apparently.&nbsp; Between the
bird, the bump on my chair, my dog growling and acting scared, and the
bulge in his groin area, all made sense that SOMETHING was in that
house!&nbsp; Never walked in those woods again!&nbsp; I no longer
reside there either.&nbsp; I found your site by accident actually, as
last night I told myself that today I was going to search the net to
see if anyone else had this similar experience around the Lake Jackson
area.&nbsp; I could not find this.&nbsp; I do not know what you do with
these personal experiences on your site, but feel free to include if
you wish.&nbsp; This occurrence happened in August 2001.<br>

The Car<br>
By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wind.shock@yahoo.com&nbsp; <br>
The same car I've seen beforeI don't like to admit it but I see a lot
of <br>
strange thing sometimes and I mean the ghostly type. While I was
driving cross country from Salt Lake to Tampa, just about heading into
Kansas, I saw a real cool looking car, it was black and had the smoked
out windows, it came cruising up behind and past me doing about 100
m.p.h, and then I saw that it had no license plate. I let him get 50
yards ahead and then I started to pace him thinking that it would keep
the cops off me, knowing that the cops would get him first. As the road
dipped and swayed in the hot sun I lost him somehow thinking that he
pulled away and got out of my sight.&nbsp; I stopped and got some gas
and got a quick bite and hopped on the road again, no more than a half
hour later I looked into my rear view mirror and here came the same
car, Black with smoked out windows, The car was traveling very fast and
was gaining on me very quick so pulled into the far right lane to let
him pass. Just as soon as he was in my blind spot on the drivers side I
looked over my left shoulder to see were he was and that's when I saw
that there was no car at all. I felt a shudder of cold and sickness in
my body. I hate it when these things happen to me because I'm always
left wondering what the hell just happened and why? Am I over reacting?
Did I let something scare me that was not meant to be so? I know what
the feeling of being haunted feels like, and this just didn't feel
right. For the first time on my trip I got real scared, but low and
behold I looked in my mirror again and saw the same black car coming up
again , I pulled off to a Hotel and got a room, I didn't even want to
think about driving ,I was still tired from the Atlanta traffic
encounter, lets just say it was hell. Well the very next day as I had
just started driving, Along came 8:00 AM, I was listening to some Ozzy
and enjoying the morning whilst driving. I looked into my mirror out of
habit and saw in the far distance behind me a small speck of a car, I
didn't think anything of it but after awhile I looked again and saw the
black car about 100 yards back and my heart skipped a beat. I forced my
self to look in away from the mirror and keep my eyes on the road and I
could not help but thinking of the old movies of the past like The Car
and one of the old Creep shows. But then I started thinking about were
I was headed and my friends Pam and Brandy in Florida to live for
awhile and I had the urge to look back into the mirror and the car was
gone but that tingle in my body remained for awhile and never saw the
car again. I wonder what it was all about? And I don't think it was
random I think It was meant to happen to me for some reason.<br>

The Most Haunted House Ever<br>
By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; allioopa@comcast.net<br>
This is a ghost, entity, evil, demon, spirit... And Whatever else was
haunting our home I can tell you. I will NEVER forget what happened as
long as I breath air. We moved into this big house when I was 15. It
had been empty for about ten years. It had old, creaky wood floors and
a ton of doors. Every where you turned in the house there was a door.
Don&#8217;t ask... I still can&#8217;t figure it out. It was a doctors house and
the very back of the house is where he saw his patients. Yes, some died
in the house in his office. Both my grandparents also died there.The
very first night we had activity. About 3am every morning there was
someone banging on our front door. My grandfather would get up and no
one would be there. This happened all the time. We would drop our car
keys in this glass bowl right when we walked in and they would be in a
different part of the house. Things were always showing up all over the
house. It likes to play tricks all the time. So many things happened I
can hardly recall them all BUT this one I will never in my life forget.
I would love to forget but I never will. I was 20 years old and just
had a baby. I had my daughter in a basinet beside my bed. I fell asleep
watching Michael Jordan play basketball in the Olympics. My bed had a
tall headboard that sat up against my bedroom window. I also had floor
to ceiling curtains. Very heavy curtains. The windows were shut, the
curtains were shut too. I was sleeping on my back...as I fell asleep to
the tv. The tv was still on and the baby was fast asleep. All of the
sudden I felt a strong man's hand covering my whole face! He was trying
to suffocate me! I was in panic mode. His grip on my face and nose was
so tight I couldn&#8217;t breath or scream. I was looking up at the ceiling
thinking I&#8217;m gonna die right here right now. It seemed like an eternity
and I was loosing my breath. Than... The phone beside my bed rang. It
stopped. I jumped so far out of the bed across the room and looked back
thinking I would be fighting off an intruder and no one was there! I
looked out the window, nothing! I looked in the mirror and I had a
bright red hand print on my face. It was evil. It was an evil
something. I was praying out loud for whatever it was to get the hell
out of my house and leave me alone. I have never been that terrified in
my life. NEVER! I looked out the window and it was pitch black. I got
the feeling like something was out <br>
there laughing at me, mocking me.&nbsp; The baby never woke up. It was
her father on the phone. I told him what happened but he thought it was
a dream. I know from the start it was as real as I am sitting here
telling you today. Not long after that, my grandfather and grandmother
died in the house on 2 separate occasions. I was left in this huge
house all alone with my 2 children. They were 1 and just months old.
The house was always freezing no matter how high the heat was on. I
would hear talking that I could never make out. Footsteps up and down
the hallway, pinching, grabbing, touching me sexually... Yes. My covers
would be on the floor on the other side of the room when I awoke. The
lights never worked. I changed the bulbs all the time. When I did the
laundry where the old doctors office use to be, I could feel breath on
my neck. I could see shadows of people out the corner of my eye. It was
a living nightmare. The energy was so thick and heavy, even on the
brightest day. I was scared to death to be there alone and go home
after work alone. I would just sit up with the tv on until I could fall
asleep and pray to God I didn&#8217;t have to go pee in the night. I was so
scared to get up. The day I moved from that house was the happiest day
of my life. I could of stayed there forever in that big house but I
wanted out! I still to this day 19 years later have vivid dreams of
what happened. All the things I heard and all the things I saw. I have
only told a few people this story.&nbsp; I've seen and felt both good
and evil from a very very young age. My nanny told me&nbsp; I had the
gift of seeing and hearing spirits, like I was a light to them.&nbsp; I
have had soooooo many experiences I cant count. Most are very bad but I
have a couple that are good. I am terrified of the after life. I pray
that God carries me to heaven. If you don&#8217;t believe, I&#8217;m telling you
there are things you cant see but they can hurt you and make you so
depressed you want to die. They can touch youm hurt you and mock you
and laugh in your face. I know, it has happened to me more than I can
count.<br>
