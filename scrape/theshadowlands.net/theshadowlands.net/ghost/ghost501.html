Regarding your Haunted Places<br>
By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anonymous<br>
--BIOGRAPH THEATRE CHICAGO, ILLINOIS<br>
IN THE NINETY'S I WAS HAVING DINNER AT A PUB ACROSS THE STREET FROM THE
<br>
BIOGRAPH THEATRE.AFTER DINNER, MY FRIENDS AND ME CAME OUT FRONT AND I
DECIDED TO GO ACROSS THE STREET INTO THE ALLEY JUST TO LOOK AROUND.<br>
I TOOK OFF RUNNING SO I WOULD NOT GET HIT BY THE BUSY TRAFFIC.<br>
WHEN I GOT ABOUT 1/3 OF THE WAY DOWN THE ALLEY, ALL OF A SUDDEN I HIT A
<br>
COLDSPOT AND I GOT STOPPED AS IF&nbsp; I HAD HIT A WALL FULL FORCE. I
COULD GO NO <br>
FURTHER INTO THE ALLEY. IT WAS AS THOUGH I WERE BLOCKED BY "SOMETHING".
<br>
NEEDLESS TO SAY, NOBODY ELSE CAME WITH ME BUT JUST WATCHED IN AMAZEMENT
AS I <br>
WOUND UP ON THE GROUND, FEELING LIKE SOMETHING HIT ME.<br>
QUEEN OF HEAVEN CEMETERY-HILLSIDE ILLINOIS<br>
There was a lightening strike that hit a tree, near the huge bronze
crucifix <br>
that is in the south part of the cemetery in the late 80's.<br>
Since then there have been apparitions, voices, people go there daily
for <br>
healing. Rosaries are left on the crucifix that, once silver, turn to
gold.<br>
I have investigated that place since it happened and had a Class A
photograph <br>
of the Virgin Mary's face in the tree that it happened.<br>
However,the photo was stolen.<br>
As of late, the Vatican has now deemed the site a MIRACLE.<br>
I have been investigating it since it happened and continue to.<br>
The children, buried close to there together in a group,it is said that
they <br>
can be heard crying aloud at night.<br>
I have interviewed police officers and sheriff patrols that vowed they
had <br>
heard them also.<br>
The part of the school which was on fire is still a part of the real
school. <br>
When the fire broke out the nuns would not let the children exit the
building <br>
but kept them , kneeling at their desks praying for help and that is
how they <br>
died.<br>
It is a very political thing and there is alot of denial if
approached., by <br>
both the school board and the parents also have protected the incident.<br>
A local newspaper article did some stories on me as a Paranormal
investigator <br>
and that was one that I addressed. After it was printed, there was alot
of <br>
ruckus, still in the late 90's. <br>
I feel as though those children, having died that way, need to be given
the <br>
chance if they were unable to "cross over" but nobody is allowed to
address <br>
the issue or investigate the school itself.<br>
I go to the cemetery and say prayers over their graves for them
however, I <br>
feel there is still much more that might be able to be done. Time will <br>
tell.....<br>

<br>
Same as Luling Texas experience...<br>
By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mgroverjr@hotmail.com<br>
<br>
I've had an "encounter" with an INVISIBLE THING such as what was posted
in the first Luling Texas post.&nbsp; <br>
It was on one of my great uncle's farms (Uncle NUT, have no idea why
they call him that) out near Elgin <br>
Texas.&nbsp; We were visiting and I got bored of the "grownup talk" so
I went out past the barn and their dog went with me.&nbsp; We went out
about 50 yards from the back of the barn and we looking for bugs and
such.&nbsp; The dog was fine, I was fine and all was good.&nbsp; The
field/woods we were in had short grass and all the trees looked about
the same age and the trunks were maybe a foot around each.&nbsp; The
trees were spaced roughly 10-20 feet apart or more and you could easily
see thru and past them without any problems.&nbsp; More trees were
behind them about the same distance but there would be no way a person
could more from behind one tree to another without being seen. The dog
was fine, I was fine and all was good. Well, pretty soon all that
changed.&nbsp; I started feeling like something BIG was up ahead of me
and the dog.&nbsp; Maybe 100 feet or more.&nbsp; I looked, nothing in
sight...&nbsp; Shake it off... keep bug hunting... Nope, something is
there.&nbsp; Can't see it but somthing is there.&nbsp; Then a loud
grunt like noise from ahead of us.&nbsp; Sounded deep like a bull or
Buffalo...&nbsp; Still can't see anything but the hair is standing up
on my neck.&nbsp; I move my position to get a better view and as I do
the dog moves closer to me and let out a low growl with is answered by
another loud grunt but slightly closer.&nbsp; Now I can hear grass and
leaves being crunched and can definately tell where the sound is coming
from but still nothing but trees and grass ahead of us.&nbsp; Those
trees can't hide a bull/Buffalo and as I look forward I see some of the
grass moving but there is no wind.&nbsp; It's like I'm in a
vacuum.&nbsp; I look down at the dog, he looks at me and whatever is
ahead of us comes closer, this time not a step but a faster pace.&nbsp;
I'm still looking at the dog and he at me, we hear a gurgly, ugly
sounding grunt and whatever it is is coming on strong at a good speed,
I look up and see bark get knocked off the side of a tree and decide
I've had enough.&nbsp; I look down to the dog who is already hauling
you know what back to the barn.&nbsp; I took off and actually got to
the barn before the dog did.&nbsp; Neither one of us stopped at the
barn, as we both headed straight to the house.&nbsp; Whatever that was
in those woods was chasing after us, snorting and stomping as it was
running after us.( I've been chased by a bull before and vividly
remember the sounds asociated with that experience) but stopped before
it got to the barn (least I think so) But it still sounded like a
bulldozer crashing around out there when I turned back towards the
field/woods once I got to the house.&nbsp; It was something! <br>
&nbsp;I went in and told my Great Uncle about what happened and he got
all worried and said, "Oh, we don't go out there" and that's all he
said.&nbsp; I later looked and on the back of the barn was painted this
weird symbol.&nbsp; Like a pair of glasses (like an infinity sign) but
with some other marks as well. <br>
&nbsp;Nope, I didn't go out to the field again and press my luck (and
the dog spend the rest of my stay under the old house).<br>

St. Bonaventure, NY<br>
By: wagerpr@gmail.com<br>
<br>
<br>
While hunting for haunted areas in the Central NY region, I found your
site.&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to <br>
that, I actually attend St. Bonaventure University.&nbsp;&nbsp; There
were two places on your site that were <br>
mentioned:&nbsp; St. Francis Hall (not Fancis) and Deveraux
Hall.&nbsp;&nbsp; While I've heard a mutlitude of <br>
stories that can be questionable, St. Francis did have some stories
that have some validity.&nbsp;&nbsp; My <br>
mother worked on the first floor, which has a designated office
area.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While one night, she was <br>
leaving from working late, she was leaving the office and turned off
the lights.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She took a <br>
couple steps around the corner, then heard a click, with the lights
turning back on.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She thinks <br>
nothing of it, believing that she didn't flipped them completely down
and they snapped back.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
She makes sure the switches were in the "off" position and starts to
walk away.&nbsp;&nbsp; Once again, she <br>
hears the audible click of the switches flipping up, followed by the
lights turning on.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She knew <br>
of strange happenings in the building, and just quickly walked out. <br>
In addition to this, there was a friar named Fr. Alphonous Trabold, who
was a huge believer of <br>
the paranormal would actually work with the community in cases where he
has needed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here's <br>
the link:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<br>
Finally, thanks for the list!&nbsp;&nbsp; Its great!<br>

Strange Experience<br>
By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cardfan2781@gmail.com<br>
<br>
My name is Ryan i am from westcentral Illinois.&nbsp; I have always
been a believer in ghosts. I have&nbsp; <br>
experienced a few things in my 30 years. But i would like to share with
you what's Been <br>
happening to me recently. I moved back to my hometown in Warsaw year
and half ago with my <br>
fiancee and her 5 year old and my new born son. I rented a house in
town it was a older house. <br>
Anyways after living there for a couple months i would always get this
weird feeling that <br>
someone was watching me. I would get goosebumps and my hair would stand
up on my neck. I <br>
would ask what they want and never get a answer. Im a insominnac so i
would stay up late <br>
watching tv. And every nite around 3 i would get that same feeling like
someone was watching <br>
me. I would also see little green orbs floating in the hallway where
there was no lite. Well i <br>
would think nothing of it and go about my tv watching. Then one nite
before i was about to <br>
move into my new house i just bought. I was laying there and it felt
like a cold breeze blew by <br>
my ear then i heard clear as day two little girls laughing and talking.
So i sat up real quick and <br>
looked around and there was no one there. My fiancee has heard similar
things. So after we <br>
moved into our new house which was built in 1974. And no one has died
in i made sure to ask <br>
the agent. Everything was good for about a month. Then my fiancee said
one day that she thinks <br>
the ghost followed us to our new house which is in the same town. I
didn't believe her at first but <br>
then i started getting that being watched feeling again. And it seems
like the ghosts likes to hang <br>
out in the basement and my 9 month old sons room. Since feeling these
things my senses have <br>
become more heighten you cold say. Well i have all kinds of noises i
could tell you about. But ill <br>
save them for another time. But ill end this with the last thing that
just happened to me. My <br>
house has been flooding in the basement the last couple of days. So
last nite it rained again and i <br>
was sleeping cause i had to get up for work at 3 am. I was laying in
bed and around 230. I felt a <br>
tugging on the covers and then the cover was being pulled over my head
not hard but not soft <br>
either. Then it sounded like people talking in my ear. I couldn't make
out what they were saying <br>
and it felt like i couldn't move. When i was finally able to move i let
out like a half moan and half <br>
scream. I scared the hell out of my girl. When i looked around no one
was there So i got up to go <br>
check on my son and my pittbull was laying in the hallway which is
weird since he lives in the <br>
basement and the door is always closed. He was calm but didn't want to
go back down stairs. <br>
After takin him downstairs i found the basement door wide open and i
was the one who made <br>
sure it was closed before i went bed. Well that's it for now. Ill rite
more later<br>

THE RED-HAIRED GIRL<br>
By:&nbsp; depps962@gmail.com<br>
<br>
These incidents happened around 1984 or 1985 in Baltimore, Maryland. I
was in my early twenties and on my way to meet a shuttle bus that would
take me to my job in Washington, D.C. It was around 1 p.m. in the
afternoon. I was driving down Windsor Mill Road going towards Woodlawn,
Maryland. As you drive down that hilly road it feels kind of creepy
because you pass an old graveyard that sits across the street from a
small stretch of old single family homes. As I drove, I looked over at
one house in particular and I saw a young girl, she appeared to be
about 10 years of age. She was extremely pale and her hair was long and
bright red. She was alone, sitting on the steps. What really stood out
was the way she was dressed. She wore a long old fashioned dress and
black granny style boots that buttoned up. The clothes looked like
something people would have worn in the 1800&#8217;s. She just sat there with
no expression on her face, staring across the street at the graveyard.
I was really puzzled seeing her, first because of the clothes she was
wearing and second, because it was extremely hot that day. We were
experiencing a heat-wave; it was at least 85-90 degrees. I figured she
was just a kid playing dress up and maybe her parents weren&#8217;t aware
that she was outside in the oppressive heat, dressed in those heavy
clothes. I went on to work and didn&#8217;t think anymore about it. I took
the same route everyday and didn&#8217;t see her again until 3 to 4 months
later. I was driving down the same road and when I came upon that house
I noticed a group of kids in front of the house, playing a very lively
game of tag; laughing and chasing each other. I looked closely and
there was the red-haired girl running along as if she were playing with
them. I say as if, because it seemed like the other kids were not
playing with her. It looked like they didn&#8217;t know she was even there.
There was no direct interaction between her and the other kids. The
kids would run one way and she would run too, but not with them. She
looked like she was playing by herself. I can&#8217;t explain it any other
way, it was just weird. She wore the same old fashioned clothes that
she had on the first time I saw her. I honestly thought my eyes were
playing tricks on me. A year passed, I changed jobs and forgot about
the sightings until one day I was having a discussion about the
paranormal with my mother. She was born in the South and had
experienced her share of paranormal sightings. I began to tell her
about my sighting and she quickly interrupted me and described what the
girl looked like and what she was wearing. She told me that she had
seen the girl before and assured me that my eyes were not playing
tricks on me, that I had indeed seen a ghost. I&#8217;ve driven down that
road several times since then but I never saw the red-haired girl again.<br>

Denison Street<br>
By:&nbsp; depps962@gmail.com<br>
<br>
In the late 80&#8217;s I began dating the man who would later become my
husband. He lived in West Baltimore, Maryland in a two-story row-house
that had been converted into two apartments. He owned the home, and
lived in the first floor apartment. The second floor apartment was
rented out to another tenant. During that time I visited him often and
had never experienced any weird occurrences.<br>
One day I went to visit him while he was in the basement doing
renovations. While down there I began to feel really weird. I can&#8217;t
really describe the feeling, but it was a nervous, uncomfortable
feeling, like heaviness was upon me. I had to get out of that room as
quickly as possible and I told my boyfriend how I was feeling and left
the room immediately.<br>
In 1992 we decided to move in together. I moved in the day before
Halloween. My parents helped me move my things into the house. My
mother took one look at the house and told me that it was creepy. She
said that it was haunted and that it gave her a bad feeling. When we
moved some of my things into the basement she told me that she
especially didn&#8217;t like that room and she felt the same way I&#8217;d felt
years before. <br>
The first six months there I didn&#8217;t have any problems. I just noticed
that my cat, could not stand being in the basement. I would do laundry
down there and he would follow me and sit at the bottom of the stairs
staring at the basement door like he was watching someone or something.
Sometimes he would run up the stairs like the devil was on his ass. I
figured he was antsy because he wasn&#8217;t used to his new surroundings. I
became pregnant with my son and that&#8217;s when things really began to
happen. One day I was home alone and heard someone call my name. The
backdoor was open and I thought my boyfriend&#8217;s brother was at the door
because he lived a few houses down the street, but when I went to the
door no one was there. Another time, I was home on maternity leave
waiting to deliver my son. My boyfriend had renovated the newly vacant
2nd floor apartment and wanted me to go up and check out his handiwork.
I decided to check it out while he was at work. I went upstairs and
walked around and felt the nervous heavy feeling that I had experienced
in the basement. This time it felt like someone was standing close and
breathing down on me. I felt the hairs on my neck stand up. I was very
scared and made it my business to go back downstairs as fast as my
pregnant, awkward body would allow me. After that incident, my cat
disappeared after going upstairs. We found him days later limping down
the street. I believe something scared him and he jumped out of the
window trying to get away from whatever he saw in that apartment. <br>
Nearing the end of my pregnancy I prepared to go to the basement to do
laundry. I hated doing laundry there because the washing machine was in
the back room of the basement. It was even creepier in that part of the
basement, especially when you were down there alone. I tried to force
my cat to go down the basement with me but when he realized what was
going down he ran and hid from me. I left him alone and went to the
basement to do the laundry. I was hanging clothes in the front part of
the basement when I felt what I thought was my cat rubbing himself
against my legs. Imagine my surprise when I looked down and saw that
nothing was there. Again the hair rose on the back of my neck. The room
became ice cold and I froze. I could not move my arms, legs, anything.
I was so scared I almost couldn&#8217;t breathe.&nbsp; When I finally got
myself together, I began to walk up the stairs telling myself that it
was my cat that brushed against my legs. He had probably snuck down
when I wasn&#8217;t looking and ran away before I looked down, but when I got
to the top of the stairs I saw that the door was completely closed.
When I opened the door and saw my cat stretched out on the kitchen
floor fast asleep, I almost passed out. I called my mother and told her
what had just happened and she instructed me to recite a prayer and
tell the &#8220;visitor&#8221; that I didn&#8217;t want it there and to move on. I did so
and also sprinkled Holy Water throughout the basement. I didn&#8217;t have
any other experiences after that. Years later my husband admitted that
the house was a deal when it bought it because the owner&#8217;s husband had
been sick and passed away inside the house. <br>

A Terrifying memory of a Haunting that won't go away<br>
By: anonymous<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of my earliest memories is of being terrified
and convinced something was after me. My parents never really believed
but I swear our house was haunted. There was something besides a ghost.
It's been in my dreams since I was three. I'm twelve now. Just because
I'm young doesn't mean I'm lying or exagerating. I write only what I
recall. Anything I'm unsure if it was a dream or my imagination I won't
include. This is all as true as I remember. It's rather long but My
house was always a source of fear at night. My room was near the attic.
It terrified me. My cat hated the attic as much as I did. When she
passed it to go into my brother's room or go near it to go into the
bathroom or my room she'd instantly begin bristling. There was always
creaking noises as if someone was pacing back and forth. It scared me
to death to the point where I would run into my room to avoid seeing
it. At the end of the hall under the attic was a mirror that didn't
have much significance other than that it made the hallways seem even
eerier. Most of my experiences happened in that hallway I hated so
much.&nbsp; One night I was sleeping heavily, as usual. I could sleep
through almost anything so the fact that I just woke up from nothing
was odd. No nightmares, no noises at that point, no extreme cold or
heat. Just randomly woke up. My cat my asleep under the attic and woke
up at the same moment I did. My windows were closed and there was no
air conditioner or any reason but my closet began shaking very
slightly. I heard whispers that eventually got louder though I couldn't
make out what it was saying. It sounded male. I got so scared I threw a
pillow at the door and it stopped, for a moment. The next night was
just as scary. My cat had begun hissing at the door. There was an eerie
shadow that looked like a child about the age of six but I couldn't
make out any features besides long hair and what seemed like a smile. A
mocking type of smile. I began bursting into tears and it vanished. My
cat calmed down and sat at the foot of my bed, her back to the closet,
starring at the door. That was the first events and the only those were
that was severe and I don't think any of it had to do with each other.
I asked my mother the next days if she heard anything, she's a light
sleeper, and she said she never heard anything. In the months following
I heard footsteps in the attic, whispers from the closet and shadows
slinking across my walls. When my great-grandmother died it stopped for
a while. There was still the attic and shadows but it was less and less
often. I felt my Nana's presence strongly and still do. It wasn't
enough to stop it but it was enough to quiet the ghost or whatever it
was.&nbsp; A few years later we dug up the back yard to put in a pool.
That's when it stopped. I found an old-fasioned gun that was small and
rusty. I began to carry it around but one day I leftit outside. It
vanished and so did the whispers I believed to be a male's voice. Where
I grew up there were many battles which led me to believe that maybe it
was from one of those. It was too small to be a rifle they used and it
still puzzles me today. The little shadow girl I had seen before she
was a shadow and she still hasn't left me.&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the age of three I woke up with a nightmare. A
little girl about the same age as I at the time had visited me in my
dreams. Say what you want but this is a re-ocurring&nbsp; dream that
still bothers me. She always wears a nightgown with lace on the bottom,
besides that is just a solid color. Sometimes it's a pale yellow and
other times is lilac. The colors seem to be of no importance otherthan
that every time I see her it alternates. Every year since she aged with
me until I was seven. Then she stoped aging but things changed about
her. She has a long braid tied up in a black ribbon. Her hair is light,
dusty brown and now at waist length. There may not be anything
paranormal about this but it bothers me. In my dreams it's always the
same. I'll be with someone, a friend, family member or even pet. It'll
suddenly go dark and everything will disappear. I'll being in utter
darkness then an eerie fog with surround me. The only light source will
be her. I become unable to move or speak and she slowly comes toward
me. I'll be screaming in my head, trying to run but unable to do
anything but watch in horror as a little girl comes towards me. Most
the time she just watches me but occasionally she holds my head in her
hands. Her eyes are black, like the pupil and the iris are both black.
She seems to want something but everytime she begins to talk I wake up.<br>
My parents say I have an over-active imagination but think about it.
Who would imagine something so horrible it scared them for years and
causes them to still be afraid of certain places even though we've
moved?<br>

Weston WV Sanitarium<br>
By:TammyC.Hall@ky.gov<br>
<br>
I had the privilege of visiting the Weston Lunatic Asylum last
year.&nbsp; I went alone hoping to join the last <br>
tour of the day but to my delight, I was the only person for that tour
so I got a personal tour by one of the <br>
extremely nice guides that also included the paranormal tour.&nbsp;
Although I went mainly just to see the <br>
buildings, I was very surprised to encounter activity in the day light
hours.&nbsp; The main floor of the doctor&#8217;s <br>
residence (it is located directly over the main entrance of the
facility and has the walk out balcony) is <br>
where I SAW doors closing on their own, the sound of doors closing next
to me but no doors actually <br>
closed and the sound of foot steps.&nbsp; Of course this facility is
huge, with many wonderful stories of days <br>
gone by as well as wonderful architecture but the old nurse&#8217;s
facilities (the nurses that worked there were required to live on the
premises at that time) gave me the worst feeling.&nbsp; I felt as if I
was being watched and someone was looking over my shoulder the entire
time.&nbsp; Although after I discussed the fact that the nurses must
have had a very hard life, living at the facility and not being able to
take advantage of living so close to town (this place literally sits
right in the middle of town!!!!) I didn&#8217;t feel the presence bearing
down so hard on me from that point on.&nbsp; <br>
It is an awesome place to visit and the fact you drive right through
the arched gates lets you know what it must have been like for the
residence of such a facility.<br>

Englewood, MO <br>
By: OehrleN@missouri.edu<br>
<br>
<br>
; bridge over Cedar Creek at the bottom of Devil&#8217;s Backbone Road in
southeastern <br>
Boone County. <br>
About 12 years ago, my college friend and I skipped class at MU and
drove out to the Devil's Backbone <br>
road, east of Englewood (out past the airport south of Columbia,
Missouri). It was a warm spring day, <br>
middle of the week, maybe early afternoon. He wanted to try out his 4WD
on the backbone road. It is <br>
massively steep and narrow; just a crushed rock road. It leads down to
an old skeleton of a steal beam <br>
and girder bridge. This road used to be one of the few Cedar Creek
crossings between Boone and <br>
Callaway County back in early 1900's. The road is no longer used and
the only thing left of the bridge is <br>
the steel girders. We drove down to the part where the bridge meets the
road, parked, and got out to <br>
just enjoy the warm sun. We walked down the bank to just below the
bridge, almost to the creeks <br>
edge. We were just standing there shooting the guy talk back and forth
and we started hearing <br>
something coming down the gravel road we had just come down. At first,
it sounded like tires on <br>
gravel. As the sound approached it was heavier, and obviously we saw no
car. The sound eventually <br>
changed to what I have described to many as "the sound of an old
buckboard wagon on a plank <br>
bridge". You could hear the wooden wagon wheels as they hit the edge of
each plank. You could hear <br>
the clanking of the chains on the wagon. And I swear you could hear the
horses&#8217; hooves as they stuck <br>
the road and then the planks. Made my hair stand on end and still does
to this day. We saw nothing. <br>
We saw no one. We both heard it independently. We both just stood there
and looked at each other <br>
in disbelief for what seemed like 10 minutes. And just as soon as the
sound appeared out of nowhere, <br>
it was gone. Maybe lasted 10 seconds.&nbsp; <br>

The Many Faces of My Home<br>
By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dessirainexo@live.com&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<br>
This information takes place over many years and has only been an
occurence with myself, <br>
anyone else living in my home has either not shared information or has
never experienced any of <br>
this at all!<br>
I grew up with my brother and my parents in a fairly new home, about 40
years old now in a very <br>
nice suburban area. There is absolutly nothing strange or scary or
spooky about the place where <br>
we live, in Mississauga Ontario Canada on the outside that is! Ever
since I was very little I have <br>
had a wide fascination with the paranormal, and the unexplained has
taken over my life ever <br>
since&nbsp; I can remember,weither that be a good thing or bad thing im
not sure but I have never <br>
been physically harmed by any experiences. It all started when I was
about 10 years old and slept <br>
in the room next to my parents room. First off, I've always been afraid
of my closet and the normal <br>
things that go pump in the night that I slept with my door open. Now my
room is at the end of a <br>
short hall way,with the staircase on the right towards the end. This
night I was laying on my bed <br>
and I could not sleep no matter how hard I&nbsp; tried and I could see
nothing but dark shadows in the <br>
hallway moving around. I felt very compelled to move to my floor and
look out into the hallway <br>
where I saw a large figure of what appeared to be a slim tall man with
short hair on the far wall <br>
of the hallway, which I started to scream and cry and ran into my
parents room not saying a <br>
word about what I saw and they dismissed the crying and screaming to be
a nightmare or of <br>
course my imagination.&nbsp; <br>
Now my family has an amazingly interesting and compelling history that
goes back generations <br>
and generation and all these stories are fresh in my mind. Some of it
is very dark and a lot is <br>
secrets that my parents only share with our immediate family. But I
have always been aware that <br>
my grandfather, my mothers father had commited suicide and my
grandmother on my dads side <br>
( my fathers mother) was a very eccentric loving woman that always
shared stories of the <br>
paranormal and u.f.o's things she very wholeheartidly believed in. My
father is a disbeliever and <br>
my mother has passed away with cancer. The reason I am sharing this is
because I believe the <br>
amount of deaths that have been from horrible diseases and accidents is
what has caused the <br>
next series of stories and events that took place over a few years
recently. <br>
I am now 23 years old and live in my brothers old room that is directly
across from my older room <br>
from when I was ten years old. My father goes to work every morning
around 6:30 am and I am <br>
currently out of work as I am starting college next semester. After my
father leaves for work I am <br>
usualy up in my room on the computer chatting or doing random things to
pass the time as im a <br>
night owl and barely sleep because of the reasons Ill tell in a second.
At about 9:00 am every <br>
morning during the fall and spring ( it only happens during this time)
I can hear large thudding <br>
and banging in my attic and what sound like someone walking back and
forth and banging on <br>
the walls. Now my attic has never been used nor is it capable of
supporting weight or anything <br>
for that matter so I know for a fact it is not an animal or anyone
living as well there is no entrance <br>
to the attic from outside.This happens everyday until the beginning of
summer all through out <br>
spring and fall and I am unsure of what this is. Until one day around
10 am I awoke to an empty <br>
house my father at work and the sunshining through my window, to my
suprise there was a young <br>
man sitting at the foot of my&nbsp; bed on the floor wearing a red cap
on his head stareing out my <br>
window with his elbow on his knee as if this is something he did
everymorning let me please make <br>
you aware that he did not aknowledge me and if it were to be classified
as a haunting it would <br>
absolutly without a doubt be residual as he did not move and was gone
within a flash of a <br>
second but I can recall every detail of this man as if he was someone I
encountered everyday. He <br>
gave me no bad feelings and infact I now believe him to be a watcher or
what some call angels. <br>
&nbsp;I am one of those people that experience sleep paralysis and I
experience it very often about <br>
every three to four days to be exact and these experiences are not
without terrifying encounters <br>
with passed souls and are the cause of my sleeping disorder I have had
these for the past 6-7 <br>
years and Is where the majority of my encounters occur. I am going to
make this part short but a <br>
few of the people I have encountered during these paralysis's are an
old elderly woman that <br>
appears to be native indian wearing a large necklace attuned with
oddities that I cannot explain <br>
possibly skulls, or bone fragments, maybe she was a hunter or she was a
skinner Im not sure but <br>
she is always calmly sitting in the corner of my room over a large vent
in the floor and <br>
dissappears when&nbsp; the paralysis finally ends,recently we have
found that there is a giant water <br>
stain of a very odd colour on the ceiling below this vent downstairs
and nothing has ever spilled <br>
or leaked down from this area and we cannot find the source. The other
is a woman that has <br>
long black&nbsp; , straggly hair and I would call her a shadow person
as her features are <br>
unreconizable and she purposly scares me as she is always directly
beside my face hovering from <br>
behind my head and is only there for a split second she is the only
spirit that fills me with so much <br>
fear and anxiety that Im shocked I have not had a heartattack from her.
The other is a shadowed <br>
figure with a long cloak or&nbsp; dress, hood over his or her head that
is in the praying position <br>
standing beside my bed who is almost always accompanied by randoms
smaller figures floating <br>
in the air this spirit is not scary or intimidating but extremely
bizzare. Other strange occurences <br>
during sleep paralysis are things moving around my room that I can
witness just as if I were awake <br>
and stareing in the room, The move around spin around and go back to
their original place. <br>
Large dogs, small dogs and black dogs at my doorway, beside my bed or
on my bed. Aswell I <br>
often catch glances of photoframes and writings on the wall that have
never been there during <br>
my or my brothers time in this room and quickly dissappear as they are
sighted. I believe I am <br>
experiencing events that have taken place on the land or in homes
before this home was built. <br>
After doing some extensive research on the area, many of these lands
were filled with Aboriginal <br>
natives that used these lands for their own purposes, burial sites and
the river about 3 miles from <br>
my home as a major transportation and trading route to other areas of
Ontario, The credit River <br>
to be exact for anyone that would like to check themselves. As well as
a Large fire that took out <br>
an entire city back in the 1890's that used to be called Springfield
Ontario which is now called <br>
Erindale Ontario is about 4 min drive from my area, and Is a location
where alot of my friends <br>
went to school as it is just over the division line of the area. I
believe the history has alot to do with <br>
these encounters but If anyone can share their similar experiences I
would be really excited to <br>
hear their stories. thanks for reading.<br>
