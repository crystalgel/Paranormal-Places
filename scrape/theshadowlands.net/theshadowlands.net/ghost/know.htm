<P><B><FONT FACE="Arrus BT">This is the question I am asked most often.&nbsp;
Many people write me and share a few experiences with me and then want
me to tell them if their home is haunted.&nbsp; Unfortunately is not that
easy.&nbsp; Each situation and experience is unique and must be looked
at closely.&nbsp; Even then, without conducting an onsite investigation,
I am just making an assumption based on the events as they were explained
to me.&nbsp; Granted some people can clearly tell me symptoms and I can
feel pretty secure in my assessment of their situation, but others give
vague descriptions and make this difficult.&nbsp; Here are some tips that
may help you form some conclusions and allow you to get an idea of what
may be happening to you.</FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arrus BT"></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arrus BT">Can the events be explained naturally?&nbsp;
You may have to call out an electrician to see if your flickering lights
are just shorted wires or really something else.&nbsp; Maybe your HVAC
service tech can find the true source of that cold spot you feel.&nbsp;
You have to rule out all natural explanations before you can turn your
attention to the supernatural.&nbsp; Other symptoms like noises, objects
moving and other events can be traced to natural explanations so do a little
research before you get concerned about a spirit.&nbsp; I remember a case
in which a woman smelled roses at certain times and she associated the
smell with her deceased mother.&nbsp; She swore it was her mother returning
to visit her.&nbsp; Upon visiting her home, the investigator found the
neighbors did floral arrangements out of their home.&nbsp; The houses were
very close together and the scent was traveling between the two homes.&nbsp;
The woman also made the connection that the "visits" only occurred in warmer
months when the windows were open.</FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arrus BT"></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arrus BT">Keep a log of any strange events.&nbsp; This
will serve two purposes.&nbsp; It can be helpful in finding natural explanations
for events that are time related.&nbsp; It is even more helpful if you
do decide there is something more in your home and have investigators assist
you.&nbsp; They will be able to see patterns and other useful information
that will make their initial job easier.</FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arrus BT"></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arrus BT">Once you cannot find any explanations for the
events you are experiencing, you are ready to get some help.&nbsp; I recommend
you contact a local (if possible) research/investigation group to come
in and check out your home with their equipment to see if they can detect
any spirit activity.&nbsp; There are many people who do this for no charge
(travel and lodging for non local groups may be requested) and are professional.&nbsp;
Meet with them first just to discuss your case and make sure you feel comfortable
with them.&nbsp; Psychics can also be used but I recommend using them in
conjunction with the other detection equipment.&nbsp; If a psychic feels
a spirit in a particular room and the other investigators get positive
readings on the equipment and photos in the same room, that validates the
psychics impressions and will make you feel more confident in the abilities
of the investigators and psychic.</FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arrus BT"></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arrus BT">Remember, don't panic!&nbsp; There is rarely
any reason for concern if you do have a spirit.&nbsp; Take it slow and
step by step and you'll find the situation easier to deal with.</FONT></B>
