<b>Ghosts at Work</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Lina.litonjua@LOSANGELES.AF.MIL</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>For some reason ghosts like to hang around me at work.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;At least they did at my last two jobs.</b>
<br><b>The first place I worked at was a shipyard.&nbsp; I used to run
a technical</b>
<br><b>library there, dealing with technical manuals and blueprints of
ships that</b>
<br><b>were being worked on at the time, as well as handling the office
supplies.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;When projects were well underway or near completion things
would get</b>
<br><b>pretty quiet. For the most part I worked there by myself with only</b>
<br><b>occasional customers or visitors.&nbsp; These experiences happened
during lulls</b>
<br><b>in activity.</b>
<br><b>One day I was sitting at my desk in the office area of the library,</b>
<br><b>which faced the customer service window.&nbsp; Between the window
and my desk was</b>
<br><b>another desk that no one was sitting at that used to be mine and
in which I</b>
<br><b>still kept some files in a drawer.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;The desk was facing me, with the drawers facing the window
at knee</b>
<br><b>level.&nbsp; I only rarely would get into that desk.</b>
<br><b>I was busy sorting through a new pile of blueprints that had just
come</b>
<br><b>in, separating them by ship and classification, and then labeling
them for</b>
<br><b>filing in the back filing system.&nbsp; This was usually pretty
tedious work,</b>
<br><b>requiring not much brainwork on my part.</b>
<br><b>Suddenly, I felt a very cold beam (only way I can describe it) of
air at</b>
<br><b>my right elbow.&nbsp; It pulled me right to attention, believe me!</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;It was a comfortable temperature in the rest of the office,
but when I</b>
<br><b>would stick my arm in this one area to my right it would be freezing
cold.</b>
<br><b>I got the impression that there was some curious entity there who
was</b>
<br><b>hanging around seeing what I was doing and didn't mean me any harm..</b>
<br><b>I talked to it and commented that what I was doing was really dull
but</b>
<br><b>it was welcome to stay and watch if it really wanted to, which it
seemed to.</b>
<br><b>After a while I was finished labeling and picked up a large postal
tub with</b>
<br><b>the blueprints in it to take it in the back and file.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;The spirit followed me there too.&nbsp; This time as I was
filing the cold</b>
<br><b>beam was on my left, and as I moved around the office filing the
blueprints</b>
<br><b>it would always be right there, very close.&nbsp; I didn't feel
any fear, but I</b>
<br><b>was a bit amused by the activity, wondering who it was and why it
was there.</b>
<br><b>After a while it seemed to go away and I kind of forgot about it.&nbsp;
But</b>
<br><b>apparently it didn't forget about me!</b>
<br><b>A little later on a customer came to the window and I went up to
find</b>
<br><b>out what he needed.&nbsp; As I walked around my old desk my knee
bashed into an</b>
<br><b>open drawer.&nbsp; This was really strange as I hadn't been near
it all day and</b>
<br><b>hadn't opened it in a while.&nbsp; Plus, it was really heavy and
was latched</b>
<br><b>shut, although not locked.&nbsp; Since I had to take care of a customer
I just</b>
<br><b>rubbed my leg and pushed the drawer shut, figuring it must have
been</b>
<br><b>slightly open to begin with and had for some reason come out.&nbsp;
But I made</b>
<br><b>sure it was latched this time.</b>
<br><b>After the customer left, I went back to my regular desk and went
back to</b>
<br><b>what I was doing.&nbsp; A few minutes later another customer came
to the window</b>
<br><b>and again I got up to see what they needed.&nbsp; I wasn't even
thinking of the</b>
<br><b>drawer and again bashed my leg right into it, pulled almost completely
out!</b>
<br><b>OUCH!&nbsp; I started to think this was strange, as I knew I had
shut it well the</b>
<br><b>last time.</b>
<br><b>I closed it again and took care of the customer at the window.&nbsp;
I saw</b>
<br><b>the beginnings of a bruise on my leg where it had hit against the
drawer and</b>
<br><b>examined the desk again.&nbsp; I pulled out the drawer and saw that
there was no</b>
<br><b>way it could have come out on it's own, it was too heavy.&nbsp;
All I could do</b>
<br><b>was slam it shut again, making sure it latched.&nbsp; I pulled on
it to make sure</b>
<br><b>this time.</b>
<br><b>So I go back to my desk, get busy again.&nbsp; About 10 minutes
later another</b>
<br><b>customer came up.&nbsp; This time I was paying attention as I rounded
the desk</b>
<br><b>corner, and sure enough the drawer was out again!.&nbsp; I realized
that the</b>
<br><b>spirit was probably playing>&nbsp; a trick on me, and once the customer
was gone</b>
<br><b>I told it that fun was fun but enough was enough and my leg hurt
so could he</b>
<br><b>please cut it out?</b>
<br><b>I shut the drawer again and checked it and luckily the next time
a</b>
<br><b>customer came up the drawer remained closed.</b>
<br><b>There was another kinda nicer incident that happened at that job
that I</b>
<br><b>will recount in a later entry.&nbsp; But right now I will recount
what happened</b>
<br><b>at the job I had after the shipyard.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;The shipyard was being closed and they were trying to find
new positions</b>
<br><b>for those of us who remained and were too young to retire.</b>
<br><b>I was lucky enough to be one of the first to be picked up and began</b>
<br><b>working at an Army Recruiting headquarters.</b>
<br><b>At the time I started there, the original building that housed them
was</b>
<br><b>being renovated and we were operating out of some trailers for a
while.</b>
<br><b>Nothing really happened there, but a few months later the building
was</b>
<br><b>finished and we moved into our new quarters, along with the recruiters
for</b>
<br><b>the other military services.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I had become friends with another female coworker in my office,
and we</b>
<br><b>would discuss all sorts of topics as she was pretty open minded.&nbsp;
One time I</b>
<br><b>was talking about some of my paranormal experiences, and she asked
if I'd</b>
<br><b>seen the ghostly woman in the bathroom we always used there at work.</b>
<br><b>I hadn't seen anything, although all of us women who worked there
when</b>
<br><b>asked would mention that a lot of the time it felt and sounded like
someone</b>
<br><b>was in there, even if they happened to be the only one in there.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Usually what would happen was that you'd hear sounds like
soft sighing</b>
<br><b>coming from another stall ( I would always check all the stalls
before going</b>
<br><b>into a stall to make sure no one was there and there wouldn't be),
or it</b>
<br><b>would sound like someone would be walking into the bathroom but
there</b>
<br><b>wouldn't be anyone there.&nbsp; Also, a few times I heard what sounded
like long</b>
<br><b>skirts rustling as the footsteps made their way through the room.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;What my friend told me was that many times when she would
go into the</b>
<br><b>bathroom she would use the first stall nearest the entrance.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;When she would push open the door of the stall, for a split
second she</b>
<br><b>would see what looked like a woman crouching by the toilet bowl,
as if she</b>
<br><b>were sick.&nbsp; She described her as possibly blonde or white haired,
wearing a</b>
<br><b>light colored dress, and looking quite miserable.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;We continued to use the bathroom and even the haunted stall,
but never</b>
<br><b>really felt any fear.&nbsp; I was hoping to get a look at her sometime
myself,</b>
<br><b>actually, but never had up to then.&nbsp; Then, both my friend and
I ended up</b>
<br><b>getting new job offers at another facility within a week of each
other, and</b>
<br><b>were in the bathroom discussing it shortly before we both left for
the day.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;My friend was standing at one sink washing her hands, facing
me; I was</b>
<br><b>at a sink two removed from her, washing my hands, and was talking
to her so</b>
<br><b>I wasn't really paying attention to anything else.&nbsp; Directly
behind me was</b>
<br><b>the entrance to the bathroom, and to my right was this small corner
shelf</b>
<br><b>installed where you could put your purse down while washing your
hands.</b>
<br><b>Just above that shelf was the paper towel dispenser, and I turned
around,</b>
<br><b>still talking to my friend, to get a paper towel.&nbsp; I was suddenly
startled</b>
<br><b>to see this woman leaning over the shelf, peering at me very intently,
with</b>
<br><b>a kind of curious look on her face!&nbsp; I turned back around to
my friend,</b>
<br><b>thinking that somehow or other I must have missed someone walking
into the</b>
<br><b>bathroom, although that would have been impossible.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I did a double take and the woman was gone.&nbsp; I asked
my friend if she'd</b>
<br><b>seen anything, and she hadn't.&nbsp; So I told her I thought I had
just seen her</b>
<br><b>ghost.&nbsp; She was an older woman, but not very much older, possibly
in her</b>
<br><b>late 40's or early 50's wearing what looked like a tiny floral print
cream</b>
<br><b>or white blouse or dress (I didn't notice beyond her upper half
in that</b>
<br><b>second), and had either very light blonde or white hair, and gave
the</b>
<br><b>impression of being scared or confused, but not a threat at all.&nbsp;
When I</b>
<br><b>described>&nbsp; her my friend confirmed that yes, that sounded
like the woman</b>
<br><b>she'd been seeing.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;That incident happened about two weeks before we left our
jobs, and we</b>
<br><b>didn't experience anything more dramatic than the usual sounds and
feelings</b>
<br><b>in the time we were there.&nbsp; That happened at the end of Sept.
'97.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;So far nothing very interesting has happened at my current
position, but</b>
<br><b>give it time!&nbsp; ;-)</b><b></b>

<p><b>&nbsp;China Ghost</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:jq32645@csun.edu</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Hi my name is Amadeo. About four years ago(why is Pink Floyd playing</b>
<br><b>here?) I was going to school in China, Tsing Hwua University. Some</b>
<br><b>friends and I went to eat at a resturant called the, "Sunny City</b>
<br><b>Market". At the end of dinner, I got up to use the men's room, and
my</b>
<br><b>Chinese teacher asked if I would take her little boy Ma' with me,
as her</b>
<br><b>husband was not there to do it. I said sure and took Ma' by the
hand and</b>
<br><b>went to the boy's room. Inside I was surprized to find western</b>
<br><b>tolits(the common Chinese tolit is a ceramic hole in the floor one
must</b>
<br><b>squat over) on the wall were two urinals, but they had duck tape
criss</b>
<br><b>crossed over them so I assumed they were out of order. Ma' and I
walked</b>
<br><b>to the tolits which where seperated from one another by connected
metal</b>
<br><b>walls. I reached to pull open(restroom doors open inward in China)
the</b>
<br><b>metal door, and it suddenly flew open and hit me in the face. I
steped</b>
<br><b>back, and looked to find nothing was there, next bitterly cold and
dank</b>
<br><b>air blew over my shoes and lower pant legs. The air hit the wall
behind</b>
<br><b>me with enough force that climed upward and I could feel it hit
by back.</b>
<br><b>The next part happened fast. Ma' let out a scream, I picked him
up and</b>
<br><b>ran toward the door, I am still not sure if I opened the door or
ren</b>
<br><b>though it but next I was out in the restuant with Ma' going crazt
with</b>
<br><b>tears, and me so pale blue my friends thought I had been shot. The</b>
<br><b>Chinese women who had brought our food saw all this and went in
to the</b>
<br><b>kitchen, moments later out came the cooks and dish boys-banging
pots and</b>
<br><b>pans together(In front of the bath room door) and chanting something.</b>
<br><b>They must have said they were sorry a thousand times-and gave us
our</b>
<br><b>food for free. As we left the head cook told our Teacher(thing that
I</b>
<br><b>could not understand Chinese-Misstake!) "I am sorry, It has never
hurt</b>
<br><b>anyone."</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now I most likely would have blown this of, if
it were not for what</b>
<br><b>happend the next morning. I woke up after fitfull sleep to find
that the</b>
<br><b>tips of most of my hair had turned grey. I put on a cap and went
to</b>
<br><b>drink tea before class. I saw Ma' and my teacher in the tea room,
and</b>
<br><b>asked how they where. My teacher took off Ma' hat to reveal that
the</b>
<br><b>tips of his hair had gone white as well.</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will never forget this. What do you think it
was?</b>

<p><b>Cemetary Spirits</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By:melodycc@earthlink.net</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>My ex girlfriend used to rent an apartment in a complex that abutts
the</b>
<br><b>east wall of Fairhaven Cemetary in Santa Ana, California. Upon moving</b>
<br><b>in, we didn't notice anything really strange (some wierd noises
- but</b>
<br><b>that's it), but a friend who visited soon afterward mentioned that
she</b>
<br><b>felt "something", a distinctly male presence.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Anyway, we started to believe her as strange little things began,
and</b>
<br><b>then continued to occur. A large decorative glass, set way back
on a</b>
<br><b>shelf and full of heavy hematite pellets somehow ended up broken
on the</b>
<br><b>living room floor one afternoon, and at night we'd often hear loud</b>
<br><b>thunks, thuds and pops in the living room area, so loud and "real"
that</b>
<br><b>I would get out of bed to investigate if there was an intruder or</b>
<br><b>something. It sounded as though a heavy object had been dropped
on the</b>
<br><b>floor from up high, like a big book or something, but when I'd check
it</b>
<br><b>out, there was never anyhting out of place.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Her roommate also mentioned that she didn't like being there alone
at</b>
<br><b>night when my ex and I were out of town. She complained that she
heard</b>
<br><b>the kitchen cabinets slam behind her as she sat and watched t.v.
We</b>
<br><b>actually began to experience this with regularity as well. Also,
my ex's</b>
<br><b>cat would, sporadically in the middle of the night, sit by the patio</b>
<br><b>sliding glass door (three floors up and looking out over the cemetary)</b>
<br><b>and hiss, scratch, yowl and throw a mad fit at something outside
on the</b>
<br><b>balcony, but there was never anything there when we checked. Strange.</b>
<br><b>The presence wasn't always there though, and sometimes weeks would
go by</b>
<br><b>with no activity. But when "he" was around, we definitely knew it.</b>
<br><b>Eventually she moved to a different unit that didn't look out over
the</b>
<br><b>cemetary, and nothing ever happened there.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Other rumors surround this Orange County cemetary, I am curious who
else</b>
<br><b>out there has experienced anything there.</b>

<p><b>Auto-Matic writing and a Demon named Sam</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: girlyblue13@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Two of my friends were over last night(one of my friends and i are
both</b>
<br><b>phychic)she kept saying there was someone in my room,like a really
hostile</b>
<br><b>person. We just shruged it off b/c were aren't always right, afterwards
we</b>
<br><b>tried to meet at a beach (we were trying OBE) she had a weird feeling
to</b>
<br><b>open her eyes and when she did there was a figure of a man leaning
over</b>
<br><b>her.</b>
<br><b>It wasn't like a detailed one (I saw it too) we could only see a
grayish-</b>
<br><b>blackish shadow standing next to her.&nbsp; My other friend say
the shadow too.</b>
<br><b>We went somewhere afterwards b/c we got really creeped out. When
we came</b>
<br><b>back we tried automatic writing we all tried it at once and we got</b>
<br><b>different</b>
<br><b>ppl. My friend who saw the man first talked to him first. He said
his name</b>
<br><b>was Sam and that he was I demon (I asked him that for some reason)
He said</b>
<br><b>he was after me but didn't say why,(what he said)was just b/c he
doesn't</b>
<br><b>like me (when we finished talking to Sam our hands were really hot
and</b>
<br><b>looked like they had burned spots on them, but didn't stay for very
long).</b>
<br><b>We talked to alot of spirits last night.&nbsp; Another was alittle
girl that</b>
<br><b>didn't know what was going on. She said she was on a farm (a farm
was here</b>
<br><b>before my house was built) Then my friend talked to someone from
her past</b>
<br><b>life (her true love) but then we found out by him that we were best</b>
<br><b>friends</b>
<br><b>in our past life and we talked to alot of other ppl in our past
life.&nbsp; But</b>
<br><b>then all of a sudden Sam jumped in and said that he ate Nate (the
guy i</b>
<br><b>was</b>
<br><b>talking to) my friend said that we had to banish Sam in order to
get Nate</b>
<br><b>back (she's into wicca but i'm not, so I don't know what she means)
I know</b>
<br><b>that Sam took alot of our energy me and friends that were there.&nbsp;
I was so</b>
<br><b>tired today that i slept til noon and I hardly do that, and I was
still</b>
<br><b>tired!</b>
<br><b>Sorry this was so long but I don't know what this stuff means, like
I</b>
<br><b>don't know why Sam is after me and my friends</b>

<p><b>"A Memorable Coincidence"</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: Terence M. Mahoney</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Tonight I stumbled on your site by chance. I find it very impressive.</b>
<br><b>I'm not sure if the following anecdote qualifies as a ghost story,
but it is the closest thing to one that I claim from</b>
<br><b>personal experience.Back when the movie "The Exorcist" first played
in theaters, the news media didn't treat it so much as a movie but as some
kind of serious national problem.&nbsp; I recall a national news magazine
reported that there was a movie theater where the floors had to be swept
up after every showing because people kept vomiting during the movie.&nbsp;
There was also a story in the press about three young men who claimed to
have become possessed while watching the film.&nbsp; The studio probably
didn't mind this kind of publicity; on the contrary, it played up stories
about how members of the cast and crew had claimed to have weird, unexplainable&nbsp;
bad luck while the movie was being shot.&nbsp; (Stories of this kind were
later used to hype a number of other horror movies, including "Poltergeist"
and "The Omen II").&nbsp;&nbsp; Director William Friedkin even managed
to get a Catholic priest to perform a rite to purge the studio of any demonic
influences during the shooting.I also recall hearing an urban legend shortly
after the movie was released about how a "demonic face" had inexplicably
appeared on a frame of the film as it was being shot.&nbsp; I suspect this
derived from the presence of two real subliminal shots of a weird face,
lasting two frames each, which appear in the film.&nbsp; One is during
Fr. Karras' nightmare early in the movie,and one is during an exorcism
scene.&nbsp; A duration of two frames is generally just long enough to
make a shot clearly visible</b>
<br><b>to a viewer who is paying close attention.&nbsp; A one shot frame,
such as was used in the movie "JFK" to show a skeleton&nbsp; dangling in
the apartment of suspect David Ferrie, merely results in a rushing blur.</b>
<br><b>I was in high school then.&nbsp; Back when the film "The Exorcist"
was first released, it was treated in the popular press not so much as
a movie but as some kind of serious social problem.&nbsp; The film first
played in theaters during the Christmas season,oddly enough, and when classes
resumed it was the hot topic of conversation at the all boy school I attended.&nbsp;
Our interest was especially high as it was widely publicized that the story
was based largely on an anctual exorcism which was performed in the late
1940s in St. Louis.&nbsp; Our high school was in a Clayton, Mo., a St.
Louis suburb, and only a couple of miles from the neighorhood where all
of this was supposed to have taken place.&nbsp;&nbsp; There was one especially
impressionable young man in my class who claimed he had been unable to
sleep for two nights after seeing it.&nbsp;&nbsp; When I eventually saw
the movie at a film festival in 1980, I wondered just what all of the fuss
had been about.&nbsp; In any case, one night shortly after school started
again in January my family got to talking about the movie, and all of thehysteria
surrounding it, as we sat at dinner.&nbsp; The question was raised as to
whether any good could come of this--might people be brought to a sincere
appreciation of religion, for instance?</b>
<br><b>I thought it would not have that effect.&nbsp; After all, I said,
there is a parable in the Gospel According to St. Luke in which God says
that if people won't believe the prophets, they won't believe one who comes
back from the dead.</b>
<br><b>An instant after I quoted this, there was a tremendous bang.&nbsp;
It sounded as though it was coming from directly overhead, which would
mean it came from my bedroom.&nbsp; My parents and I rushed upstairs.&nbsp;
It had sounded to each of us as though my heavy wooden bed had suddenly
collapsed.&nbsp; I turned on the lights (this was January, remember, when
the nights get very dark very early), and saw that everything looked fine.&nbsp;
I walked across the hall and turned on the light in my parent's bedroom.&nbsp;
My mother and father slept in twin beds which they kept pushed together.&nbsp;
As I turned on the light, I found I was staring&nbsp; at an object on the
wall directly the crack where the two beds met.&nbsp; At first I couldn't
tell what it was; it looked to me as though a wooden board had somehow
thrust out of the wall.</b>
<br><b>Then I realized what it was.&nbsp; When my parents married in 1945
my parents had been given a present by his pastor: a large crucifix, consisting
of a heavy metal statue of Christ nailed to a wooden cross.&nbsp; We moved
into our house in 1958 and, with the exception of being taken down a couple
of times when the room was painted, that crucifix had hung on the wall
over their beds that whole time.&nbsp; Just as I said "they won't believe
one who has returned from the dead", that crucifix had come apart.&nbsp;
There was nothing left of it on the wall except the vertical piece.&nbsp;
We found the cross beam, the statue, and the nails all scattered on the

<p><b>A Couple of Experiences Concerning My Father</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By:&nbsp; rupertoc@qvsd.org</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I have had a few paranormal experiences. I come from a family that
is very well educated and rather skeptical in nature. My father was a USAF
Colonel and flew the most sophisticated, fastest airplane in service to
date - the SR71. He absolutely had nerves of steel. However, he ended his
life a member of MUFON, and an expert researcher of UFO sightings. He never
said he believed in UFOs, only that he researched the possibilities...</b>
<br><b>The two incidences I wish to tell you about concern my father, who
died of leukemia at age 64. He lived on a lake outside of Spokane, Washington.
I live in Pennsylvania. During the 10 months of Dad's illness, my husband
and I flew back and forth several times, last visiting with him at the
end of May. I somehow knew he had about 6 weeks to live. He was still fairly
active and hated discussing his illness, but I knew anyway. I was relieved
when my brother and then my sister came to see him and stayed to care for
him in his beautiful lake home. My brother lived an hour away, so he was
readily availabe; my sister is a nurse who had cared for terminally ill
people before and flew free through her pilot husband. It was summer, so
my sister (who teaches nursing) was on vacation - you can see this was
the best situation. My husband and I both work and the traveling was getting
rather expensive. The deal was that my brother and sister would call us
when my father's condition became such that death was imminent. We would
come for our final goodbyes.&nbsp; The call came one evening. My sister
said we'd better come as soon as possible. I found that the earliest available
flight was not the next day, but the day after that. We started laundry
and made the phone calls to arrange care for the pets and my son. Then,
exhausted, we went to bed.</b>
<br><b>I awoke around dawn. I went to the bathroom and came back to bed.
As I was trying to get comfortable, I heard my father's voice say, "Christy."
(He was the only person who called me this) I rolled over and my father
was standing next to the bed. He said, "I just want you to know that I
did my best." For some reason, I wasn't scared at all. The next instant,
he was gone.</b>
<br><b>I woke up again later and at the time attributed what had happended
to a dream, even though I really knew that although I was "out of it",
I had been awake.&nbsp; I didn't call my father's house the next day because
I knew phone calls would disturb them. My sister had sounded like they
had their hands full as my father's faculties began failing. But, she called
me that evening. I asked her how things were going. She said that Dad had
slipped into a coma at around 2:30 in the morning. They then tried to sleep
off and on during the day and evening, while keeping vigil.</b>
<br><b>I was really surprised, because he was still aware and coherent
when we last touched base. However, when I thought about it,the time coincided
with when he visited me, being in the eastern time zone. I think he came
to tell me that although he was often absent when I was young and rather
hard-edged and distant as I grew older, that he had done the best that
he could. Once upon a time I felt like he just didn't care. Now I understand
that all any of us can do is the best we can with the cards we are dealt
in life.</b>
<br><b>The next item is really, really strange. I don't know if it'll translate
well to print, however. My dad died a seven months after I married my second
husband. My ex-husband was still living in our old home and I still had
some things boxed up in the basement. Things like old Christmas decorations
that I didn't really need and what not.</b>
<br><b>Well, my husband Rick and I had just returned from the "good bye"
trip that turned out to be my father's funeral trip. We were still unloading
my Dad's Pathfinder (we drove back) and my ex called. He had finally (three
years after our divorce) cleaned out the basement. There were a couple
boxes that I might want. I told him to bring them on over, the house was
going to be full of "stuff" from my dad's a little more wouldn't hurt.
Two boxes came. Curious, I opened the first. Christmas junk. I set that
aside and opened the second. Sitting on top of everything else was a brand
new blue leather photo album. I thought, "What the hell is this?" All our
photo albums have been red leather - I didn't recognize it at all - and
thought I had taken all the albums that I should have.</b>
<br><b>I could not believe my eyes. Upon opening the book I came upon a
note on the back of one of my Dad's business cards. It read, "Christy's
book." Within it were all the old pictures from my childhood that my father
had been holding on to. Some I had never seen. Being in a military family,
we didn't keep much as we moved from place to place. We have very few truly
prized posessions, but photos are at the top of the list. I had, up to
this point, never seen the book. Yet, it had been packed away in a box
in my ex-husband's basement over three years, only to appear JUST as we
are coming from my dad's funeral.&nbsp; Another strange thing is that the
book contains pictures of my brother's grave. Stephen died in Africa before
I was ever even thought of. I believe it was 1958. The pictures of my brother's
grave are in color and look absolutely BRAND NEW. There are piles and piles
of flowers on the grave, so I know it was just after the burial. Also,
it's in Libya. Believe me, my father was a world traveler, but he wouldn't
have set foot in that country again. The pictures are in very stark contrast
to the faded, wrinkled, sometimes black and white photos taken of me -
and I was born in 1961. I've shown people the book</b>
<br><b>while I've told the story and it freaks them out pretty good. The
pictures look like they were developed yesterday.</b><b></b>

<p><b>A Bad Night's Sleep</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: jeff@mail.intlsensor.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>May 10, 2000: I'm new to this site, and am amazed that there are
so many people who have had otherworldly experiences. I had no idea! I
have always been interested in the paranormal, but not much in that regard
has ever happened to me, except for the thing I'm about to relate. I've
always felt that some people are more attuned to the beyond than others.
While I have been to many haunted places like Gettysburg, the Queen Mary,
and both Whaley house and the Hotel del Coronado in San Diego, I felt nothing
(of course, I didn't ask to stay in any of the haunted rooms in those places
either). But in March of 1986 something happened that scared me very badly,
although I'm not sure whether it was really a haunting or not. Here it
is:Single at the time, I was moving from Houston, Texas to Southern California.
I decided to take a leisurely drive along the I-10 all the way out. Leaving
in the evening, I stayed the first night in a Holiday Inn in San Antonio,
then set out the next morning across the state of Texas. It was a beautiful
drive and I was in a great mood. That night I stopped in a small town named
Van Horn, east of El Paso. I don't remember the name of the little motel
I stayed at, but it wasn't a chain; it was a family owned business with
rooms structured like garden apartments all strung together, and the adjoining
restaurant</b>
<br><b>had really good food.That night I kicked back and watched a Charles
Bronson movie while having a couple beers. NOTE: I was NOT drunk. By eleven
I was pretty tired and went to bed. I don't know if I dropped off right
away, but soon I was aware that I was lying there wideawake for some reason.
Slowly it dawned on me that I was hearing noises in the bathroom.The room
was pretty basic: You go in the door and the bathroom is on the right,
and the room itself is straight ahead, with the bed off to the side. At
first I thought it was just plumbing noises, but the more I listened, I
became sure it was the sound of someone moving around in there, puttering
around by the sink. I was sure that someone was in there. I figured that
somehow my door was ajar and someone had wandered in and was using the
bathroom by mistake. Slowly I got up and rounded the corner - the bathroom
was dark and no one was there; my door was locked securely.Well, I didn't
think my assumption about a stranger made any sense anyway, so I just stood
there frowning. The noises had stopped. Shrugging, I went back to bed.
I lay there for some time listening, but no further sounds were evident.
Just as I was dropping off to sleep again, those same weird sounds started
up again. I was starting to get the creeps. I tried to tell myself that
I was hearing someone in an adjoining room; you know how you can hear others
surprisingly loudly based on the local acoustics in motel rooms.</b>
<br><b>That's what I told myself, but I kept hearing it, and I didn't beleive
it. And those swishing and clattering sounds seemed to be repeating themselves
somehow, if that makes sense. Well, I got up again and went to look, and
again the noises stoppedimmediately when I rounded the corner. Once inside
the bathroom itself, all seemed normal.</b>
<br><b>This went on a few more times until about 2:00 or 3:00 AM, until
I was pretty flustered. Finally at about 3:30 AM I was lying there hearing
this crap and still telling myself that it was someone in another room.
Then suddenly I remembered what the proprietor at the check-in desk told
me - that I pretty much had the whole wing there to myself. It was off
season. Then I freaked out totally. I jumped upand packed furiously, muttering
to myself the whole time. Timidly I went into the bathroom (which quieted
down again naturally) and got my stuff. I took off out of there right away
at 4:00 AM. I was so rattled it didn't occur to me to ask anyone at the
desk what might have happened in that little room. The guy there just asked
if everything was OK, since I was looking pretty screwed up by that point.
But I said nothing and just drove off down the freeway.</b>
<br><b>By noon I started to calm down. By that evening I had convinced
myself that I was just being utterly stupid and a</b>
<br><b>scairdy-cat for no reason. But I've never forgotten those eerie
sounds, like someone just puttering around in the bathroom at the sink.
I didn't notice if anything had been moved around in there during the experience.</b>
<br><b>Well, that's it. Not very dramatic I suppose, but I was really unnerved,
and I still can't explain any of it. If anyone has any ideas or comments,
please e-mail me at jeff@intlsensor.com. I'd really like to hear from you.
Thanks for reading this.</b>
