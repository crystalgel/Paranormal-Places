<P><B>GREEN HAZE</B>

<P><B>By: soldy@optusnet.com.au</B>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B>G'day, my name is Kon&nbsp; &amp; after reading quite a few stories
on your</B>
<BR><B>site made me want to share an experience that both my wife and I
had back in</B>
<BR><B>October 1995.</B>
<BR><B>I live in the Eastern Suburbs in Melbourne Victoria, Australia and
other</B>
<BR><B>than this experience have never experienced any paranormal activity
before</B>
<BR><B>or after the following event.</B>
<BR><B>I have always remained opened minded about the occult, paranormal
activity</B>
<BR><B>and the like and I must say that it does fascinate me .........
each to</B>
<BR><B>his/her own I suppose.</B>
<BR><B>In mid October 1995 my wife was pregnant with what was to be our
first child</B>
<BR><B>at the time and the due date wasn't all that far away, so needless
to say we</B>
<BR><B>were both ecstatic and anxious at the same time.</B>
<BR><B>Late one night whilst my wife was sitting up in bed watching television
&amp; I</B>
<BR><B>being a shift worker was lying next to her trying to get some sleep,
she</B>
<BR><B>asked me to get up to turn the tv off as she wasn't feeling all
to well and</B>
<BR><B>wanted to get some sleep.</B>
<BR><B>A little while later I felt Vicky trying to sit upright complaining
that she</B>
<BR><B>couldn't sleep and she in turn woke me asking what that green haze
in the</B>
<BR><B>corner above our dresser was, to which I replied must be the light
from the</B>
<BR><B>street reflecting on the multi coloured stain glass lamp shades.</B>
<BR><B>Vicky didn't think much of it &amp; then proceeded to read, however
curiosity</B>
<BR><B>got the better of me so I got up out of bed closed the bedroom door
&amp; rolled</B>
<BR><B>down the roller shutter blinds &amp; turned off the light, but that
green haze</B>
<BR><B>was still there, so I closed the robe doors as the tv was in there
&amp; thought</B>
<BR><B>it may be the tv that was giving off that haze all to no avail.</B>
<BR><B>I actually put my hand through it &amp; felt nothing unusual, however
I was</B>
<BR><B>trying to come up with some sort of logical explanation for it when
I gave</B>
<BR><B>up &amp; went outside for a smoke and upon returning for bed again
the haze was</B>
<BR><B>still there &amp; if memory serves me correct was still there till
the sun came</B>
<BR><B>up.</B>
<BR><B>We both got up at about 6.00am did all the usual things one does
in the</B>
<BR><B>mornings like having a shower, breakfast etc, when Vicky complained
that she</B>
<BR><B>wasn't feeling well at all, so I rang in sick &amp; drove ourselves
straight to</B>
<BR><B>the hospital.</B>
<BR><B>After my wife having an Ultrasound and some other tests we were
both told</B>
<BR><B>that unfortunately we had lost our baby, and this all happening
the same</B>
<BR><B>time where my wife lost her father 5 years prior.</B>
<BR><B>Now to be quite honest I can only assume that what we saw was more
than</B>
<BR><B>likely attributed to our loss, however nothing out of the ordinary
has</B>
<BR><B>happened since &amp; we generally don't talk about this as it still
opens up old</B>
<BR><B>wounds eventhough we now have 2 beautiful daughters.</B>

<BR><B>Am I Crazy?</B>

<P><B>By: link120280@yahoo.com</B>

<P><B>I am a big fan of this sight. I never in my life</B>
<BR><B>believed that I would have a story to tell. Compaired</B>
<BR><B>to the stories posted here, mine is nothing. All the</B>
<BR><B>21 years of my life I had starnge things happen to me,</B>
<BR><B>but I never really accepted them as a haunting until</B>
<BR><B>this morning. Maybe is my wild imagination or just</B>
<BR><B>part of my dream I don't know. Maybe someone reading</B>
<BR><B>this now can suggest what it could be. Here is my</B>
<BR><B>story. This is my second year in college.</B>
<BR><B>Unfortunately I live in the dorms. Just this year I</B>
<BR><B>have been feeling like someones with me but when I</B>
<BR><B>look around... I am alone. My first experiance was</B>
<BR><B>when I was laying on my stomach on my bed (which is</B>
<BR><B>the top bunk)listening to my CD player. I literally</B>
<BR><B>felt as if someone sat by my side. You know... when</B>
<BR><B>someone sits next to you on a bed or couch and you</B>
<BR><B>kinda roll into the person that just sat down? It was</B>
<BR><B>no muscle spasm or anything that might of influenced</B>
<BR><B>this feeling. Not every morning, but its happened a</B>
<BR><B>lot to me that I hear noises of my roommate getting</B>
<BR><B>ready for the day. Granted... maybe it's just the room</B>
<BR><B>next door or noises coming from the vents, but when</B>
<BR><B>you live in the dorms for over a year... you can tell</B>
<BR><B>the difference of what noise is coming from where. But</B>
<BR><B>I swear I hear the noises of my roommate getting ready</B>
<BR><B>when she is not in the room. More than once I ask tell</B>
<BR><B>her she's going be late, or 'aren't you ready yet' and</B>
<BR><B>once I even said 'I thought you left already'. But I</B>
<BR><B>look around... and I am by myself. Okay... Until today</B>
<BR><B>I brushed those things off. My roommate has classes</B>
<BR><B>every day at 8am. So she has to get up early. Hence</B>
<BR><B>the reason I am still in bed most of the morning. I</B>
<BR><B>usually don't get out of bed until 10. This morning I</B>
<BR><B>heard her get ready for class... I saw her leave. I</B>
<BR><B>went back to sleep. I was having a dream and all of</B>
<BR><B>the sudden I hear a whisper of a girl (I assumed it</B>
<BR><B>was my roommate) and the whisper said "hey Jess, you</B>
<BR><B>still tired up there?" Because I thought it was my</B>
<BR><B>roommate I groggly responded and said 'What?'</B>
<BR><B>questionly because I thought she left for class. I was</B>
<BR><B>scared... my heart was racing because this sounded</B>
<BR><B>real to me... but I was having a dream so I was just</B>
<BR><B>thinking I'm just weird... and rest my head back down</B>
<BR><B>on my pillow..but I heard the whisper again "hey</B>
<BR><B>Jess..." With that... I couldn't take it anymore... I</B>
<BR><B>felt like my heart was going to jump out. I decided I</B>
<BR><B>couldn't stay in bed. I got out of bed and turned the</B>
<BR><B>tv on and started to clean the room. My roommate came</B>
<BR><B>in at 9am and was surprised that I was up and about so</B>
<BR><B>early. I dont' know how to explain it. It might of</B>
<BR><B>been a part of my dream... though (I) believe it's not</B>
<BR><B>because it doesn't go along with what I was dreaming.</B>
<BR><B>In my dream when I heard the first whisper, I was</B>
<BR><B>(don't laugh) climbing a wall of my friends house with</B>
<BR><B>suction cups..... that wouldn't fit because I was</B>
<BR><B>having too much fun in my dream and I was by my self</B>
<BR><B>.... Am I starting to go nuts? This part my have</B>
<BR><B>nothing to do with hauntings or maybe I just don't</B>
<BR><B>know what is going on but just recantly when I use the</B>
<BR><B>elevators to go down ( I live on the top floor #9)it</B>
<BR><B>always stops at floor #6. Now... yes it could be</B>
<BR><B>someone just at the floor that got on another elevator</B>
<BR><B>or just went somewhere else... but it's no just a</B>
<BR><B>certain elevator... it happens no matter which one I</B>
<BR><B>use... That's my story.</B>

<P><B>Michelle</B>

<P><B>By: malo95@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a story that spans over two years, roughly,
and has been my only identifiable experience with what seemed to me to
be the supernatural. Early in the morning, in mid February of 1999, I received
a phone call from my sister. Immediately I was alarmed. Although this doesn't
sound unusual enough to cause an uproar, everyone knows that the women
in my family don't roll out of bed until noon. After unusually succinct
pleasantries, Ce-Ce informed me that my best friend, Michelle, was dead.
She had heard it that morning from a friend of a friend who knew how close
Michelle and I were, before I moved out of my home town of Baltimore to
go to college in Florida. Michelle had been a very trouble soul all our
lives, and she succeeded in finding a man who ended hers for her. Since
she had been murdered, I suspected from the beginning that perhaps her
soul, as confused as it already was, may not have been able to pass on
easily, if at all. The last time we spoke, which was roughly two months
prior to her death, she sounded disoriented and slightly hysterical, only
the way someone who is desperately trying to avoid reality can. She was
telling about the voices that she has started hearing in her head and how
she liked inflicting wounds upon herself, lovely.&nbsp; I cannot say that
I was surprised to hear of her passing, although my pain was sharper knowing
that I could never tell her of the child I was expecting in 8 months.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fast-foward 6 months- my husband and I are living
in Illinois, just south of Chicago, strange things start happening. One
night, I'm in the kitchen of our rented home and I hear a deafening- I
tell you- deafening crash, upstairs, right above my head, where the 2nd
bathroom would be. I thought my husband took a flying leap off the toilet
and crash landed on the floor. (Why he would be doing that, I don't know,
but that's what it sounded like.)</B>
<BR><B>I called out "Honey, are you all right!?"</B>
<BR><B>He says "Ya, are you all right?"</B>
<BR><B>Apparently, he was in the bathroom downstairs, 15 ft. from me and
had though something had happened to me. We checked all over the house,
from attic to garage and found absolutely nothing out of place. It was
so weird that we just brush it off as a sonic boom or something equally
out of the ordinary. Then, I started being woken up from my afternoon naps
(pregnancy is very tiring) by loud noises, like a car door slamming, but
upon inspection, finding no one outside on our quiet street. One time I
was woken up by someone calling my name, once, loudly: TARA!&nbsp; Why
that, or any of these incidents, didn't scare me, I can't tell you, but
they didn't. Then the last occurrence, before we moved out of this house
and on to greener pastures, was at 1:30 in the morning. My husband and
I were laying in bed, talking, and all of a sudden, the sliding door that
covered the towel closet outside of our bedroom, came off it's tracks,
fell over and promptly slide down the steps that were directly in front
of it. The top of the door slamming against each step as it slid down sounded
like someone was firing a machine gun in our foyer.</B>
<BR><B>December, 2000. Now we're living in Cleveland, OH. Everything went
back to normal for a while, until my jewelry started disappearing and showing
up in really strange places, that I knew my daughter, that had finally
made her worldly appearance in November of 1999, could never have done.
I also felt the creeps many, many times as I was changing my daughter's
diaper in her bedroom; it felt just like someone was in the doorway staring
straight at the back of my neck. This was unnerving especially because
I was a stay-at-home Mom at the time and had wild fantasies about crazed
rapists and such. The last straw came when I found my wedding band rolled
up in dirty diaper in the trash can, whatever was trying to get my attention,
had it! Then one night, in February of 2001, I woke up, again, to the sound
of the front door slamming and in my half-awake mind, for some reason,
I imagined that it was someone leaving. Upon entering the living room,
I noticed that there was no cold air present, where there would have to
be if the front door had really opened on a painfully cold winter night.
After that, things went back to a decidedly sub-supernatural tone. I always
assumed it was Michelle sticking around after her untimely departure. After
all, she always said I was the only person she ever really trusted.</B>

<BR><B>Our Ghost</B>
<BR><B>By: Bobbi</B>

<P><B>I have an entity in my home in McGregor Iowa. It is very harmless
but</B>
<BR><B>mischievous...Tho at times very helpful also. My children named
it years</B>
<BR><B>ago when they were small. The house is 125 years old, well, thats
as far</B>
<BR><B>as the deed goes back to when it was named a town...Before that
they did</B>
<BR><B>not have to register it. It seems to become more active when I redo</B>
<BR><B>things or when everything becomes hectic.. The only one who didn't
get</B>
<BR><B>along with it was our dog and he would growl and his hair would
stand up</B>
<BR><B>on the his back when it roved...I think I am very lucky that it
is not</B>
<BR><B>destructive but it definitely is full of suprises...I have had this</B>
<BR><B>house since 1976 and would not trade it nor the entity for</B>
<BR><B>anything.....It is a large 2 story brick with a one story brick</B>
<BR><B>attached, seems that part must have been for servants as it has
a</B>
<BR><B>kitchen, dining room and bedroom and I conjoined the bathrooms for</B>

<BR><B>STRANGE OCCURRENCES</B>

<P><B>By: kbnra@starpower.net</B>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B>I am fourteen and have been living in my house for twelve years.
We built our house on property that&nbsp; we were told had never been built
on before.&nbsp; A couple of years ago my father was gardening in the front
yard. He uncovered a couple of bricks and a horse shoe.&nbsp;&nbsp; At
that time I was very into archeology, and decided to keep the horse shoe&nbsp;
in my room. About a month ago, I saw a bright white light in my neighbors
window early in the morning. (I saw this while waiting for the bus.) It
was not an ordinary light, it did not have the right color, and the light
was floating in the middle of the room. It was not a candle, because the
light was a constant, bright light. It did not flicker. I remembered that
he husand had died a couple of months ago.</B>
<BR><B>A few nights later&nbsp; I heard something like mumbling. My stereo
was up pretty high, so I decided to turn it down to see whether my mom
was talking to me or not. In fact, what I heard was humming. The voice
belonged to no one in my house.</B>
<BR><B>The next night, I was staring off into space, looking into my light.
I suddenly realized that my light was turning blue, then purple, then pink.
I was very frightened. I though maybe I had been staring at the light too
long, until I looked in the mirror and the lightbulb in the mirror was
different colors too. I then asked my sister to come in. She stared at
the light bulb, and saw it too.</B>
<BR><B>I then started talking to the ghost. Telling it that if it was really
there, I would like a sign. A looked around the room for a couple of minutes,
and saw that the clock, which ordinarily would have read 8:10, was flashing
the nubers 8 and 0. My sister saw this, too.</B>
<BR><B>A couple of days later, I was listening to music (Paula Abdule).
I was listening to one of the slow tracks, turned up really high. I heard
a man's voice. Unfortunatly, the music was up to much for me to hea what
the voice said.</B>
<BR><B>I have four porcelain dolls in my room. When I turned my head, it
seemed as though they were blinking. A few days later, the pretty one on
the end, whose mouth was painted on, smiled at me. Really. I thought I
was crazy. Not a smile that showed teeth, just a tugging upward of the
lips.&nbsp;&nbsp; Even now, a month later, the doll smiles at me. I find
it quite unnerving, and sometimes refuse to sleep in my room. ( Hey, I
saw Chucky you guys!)</B>
<BR><B>I then heard footsteps in my room, with my mother with me. She heard
them too. We heard them again downstairs, but that time it sounded like
they were above us. Where we were "above us" was my room.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;About a week ago, my mother wanted me to go get something
outside to get something. I am incredibly afraid of the dark.&nbsp; I was
standing by the door, when I saw in the reflection of a coat swaying. I
turned around to see if I sould use the coat to warm myslef while outside,
and also because I did not feel a breeze, and wondered why the coat ws
moving.&nbsp; I turned around to find no coat. I turned around and saw
the reflection again. I looked all around the surrounding area, but no
coat.&nbsp; I looked again at the screen door, but the image was gone.
About fifteen minutes later, while still pondering why I saw this, I realized
it is impossible to see a reflection through a screen door.</B>
<BR><B>Still today strange things are happenning. If anything similar has
happened to anyone out there, PLEASE write your story- I am desperate to
have some one reassure me that I'm not crazy.</B>

<P><B>Highland Park Highschool</B>

<P><B>By: mwolfr@mindspring.com</B>

<P><B>Hi. First Off - great site.&nbsp; I can sit and read these stories
for hours.&nbsp; Of course I find myself looking over my shoulder a lot
and making my dog stay in the room with me (cluck-cluck I'm a chicken).&nbsp;
Anyway.&nbsp; I was looking in your haunted places index and I noticed
that Highland Park Highschool was in there.&nbsp; My Dad attended school
there and after he retired from the Air Force he worked there for over
30 years.&nbsp; I happened to mention to him the info that I read on the
Haunted Index and he said he never heard about a little boy, but he did
tell me that there was a janitor that had worked there for a long time.
He was there when my Dad was a student and was promoted to dept. head or
King of the janitors (or whatever the title is) by the time my Dad started
working there.&nbsp; My Dad is very friendly to everyone and he said he
would try and strike up conversations with this man, but he was a loner
and never really spoke too long.&nbsp; He lived alone and had no family.&nbsp;
The story goes that this janitor fell in love with an elderly woman that
worked in the women's locker room and they had a stormy on again - off
again romance.&nbsp; After a while it was all over the gossip mill that
this relationship was o-v-e-r.&nbsp; A few weeks later someone noticed
that this guy had not been showing up for work and when they finally went
to his house they found that the poor guy had hung himself.</B>
<BR><B>My Dad told me that after that strange things started to happen
and there have been a few people who have said that they have seen him
walking down hallways.&nbsp; I don't have any specifics - but I thought
I would just pass on this little tale.&nbsp; I will be submitting another
HPHS story that happened to my Father while he worked there, but he want's
to write it himself.</B>
<BR><B>So look out for PART II.</B>

on</B>
<BR><B>base.&nbsp; The area we lived in had at one time been hit by a tornado
and</B>
<BR><B>several people were killed.&nbsp; The front door would open and
close by</B>
<BR><B>itself all the time.&nbsp; I was trying to wean my daughter from
her blanky,</B>
<BR><B>so I would put it on top of the fridge, there also was a child gate</B>
<BR><B>across the kitchen door.&nbsp; When I would come back in the room
she would</B>
<BR><B>have her blanky back.&nbsp; I once walked into her bedroom and as
I did a</B>
<BR><B>book fell from the air into the rocking chair that was rocking.&nbsp;
When I</B>
<BR><B>asked her what she was doing, she said nana was reading her a story.</B>
<BR><B>The final thing was when one night when our second daughter had
just</B>
<BR><B>been born.&nbsp; I woke up to the sound of voices on the baby monitor.&nbsp;
It</B>
<BR><B>was a woman and little child and they were talking about how beautiful</B>
<BR><B>the new baby was.&nbsp; I woke up my husband, he said that it was
probably</B>
<BR><B>picking up other transmissions.&nbsp; Then I heard the child ask
the woman</B>
<BR><B>the baby's name and she said Holly Nicole, my babies name.&nbsp;
I ran into</B>

<P><B>Another Tale of St. Louis, Saskatchewan, Canada.</B>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B>By:swomacks@ualberta.ca</B>

<P><B>I had an experience at this location similar to the gentleman who
shared his</B>
<BR><B>story, so I'd like to share mine as well.</B>
<BR><B>One evening out of the blue, my friend told me about this "haunted
track" just</B>
<BR><B>outside that small Saskatchewan town.&nbsp; We decided to take the
several hour</B>
<BR><B>trip just for fun, to see it.&nbsp; My friend who knew about it
had already been</B>
<BR><B>there several times, and told us exciting but scary stories about
it.&nbsp; Not</B>
<BR><B>knowing what to believe or what we'd see, I was very doubtful about
the events</B>
<BR><B>that were to come that evening..</B>
<BR><B>Two carloads of us made the trip that wintery night.&nbsp; We drove
our vehicles</B>
<BR><B>down the track, past some "no tresspassing" barcades, and parked.&nbsp;
We got out</B>
<BR><B>to look.&nbsp; So to speak, we "saw the light": this bright light
similar to a</B>
<BR><B>single headlight, slowly moving towards us.&nbsp; We then noticed
it would split in</B>
<BR><B>two, move fast, slow down, merge back into one, and repeat at fast
rates.</B>
<BR><B>Freaked out, we ran back into the cars to leave to notice the one
larger car</B>
<BR><B>got stuck in the snow.&nbsp; We tried to get out, the longer and
harder we tried,</B>
<BR><B>the brighter the light got.&nbsp; We couldn't move the vehicle away
from the light</B>
<BR><B>because of the snow, but the guys figured we could move it forward
(towards</B>
<BR><B>the light unfortunatley).&nbsp; Myself and another girl slowly walked
towards the</B>
<BR><B>light to see if there was a clearing so we could turn around.&nbsp;
When we did</B>
<BR><B>this, the light seemed to fade away.&nbsp; We walked quite aways
down, then decided</B>
<BR><B>to go back to the cars.&nbsp; We turned our backs to the light,
which was at this</B>
<BR><B>time, quite aways away.&nbsp; You just have to look back, and after
a few steps, we</B>
<BR><B>did.&nbsp; The light instantly grew in intensity and jumped what
was like 50-70</B>
<BR><B>feet towards us and was right behind us....we ran to the cars...it
followed</B>
<BR><B>just as fast.&nbsp; Something, it wasn't the snow, kept making me
trip.&nbsp; Over and</B>
<BR><B>Over agian... hurting my foot even more each time... i was in verge
of tears.</B>
<BR><B>Eventually somehow we got back into the cars, managed to get turned
around,</B>
<BR><B>and started heading back, then the car infront of us got stuck.&nbsp;
The light</B>
<BR><B>moved up the road with us, but at this time maintained a bit of
a distance.</B>
<BR><B>We got this car unstuck with less trouble than the first, and proceeded
a few</B>
<BR><B>meters more when we came back to the barracade.&nbsp; I don't know
how we got past</B>
<BR><B>it at first... it seemed impossible to get back.&nbsp; Big pieces
of metal in the</B>
<BR><B>middle of the path, ditch with trees on the side...maybe just enough
to get a</B>
<BR><B>car through...if there was light.&nbsp; One of the girls got on
top of the pile</B>
<BR><B>with a flashlight to show where the edge of that was, I got in the
ditch to</B>
<BR><B>show where the edge of it was.&nbsp; Turned on the flashlights,
and the most obsurd</B>
<BR><B>happened....</B>
<BR><B>The spotlight went crazy: fast, unpredicatble movements, sudden
duplications,</B>
<BR><B>merges, etc.&nbsp; Then little red lights surrounded it as it turned
into one huge</B>
<BR><B>glowing white light.&nbsp; Then the huge light went out, gone, instantly.&nbsp;
The red</B>
<BR><B>lights remained....and they flew towards us at high speeds.&nbsp;
I tried to get</B>
<BR><B>myself out of the ditch and run to the car, but my foot felt as
if it was</B>
<BR><B>being pulled back by someone.&nbsp; I yelled at the top of my lungs
for help, but</B>
<BR><B>everyone else was spooked by the red lights and they were running.&nbsp;
More</B>
<BR><B>resistance was felt on my ankle...and I looked back at it and noticed
the red</B>
<BR><B>little lights now about a meter from me.&nbsp; I yelled at them
to leave me alone,</B>
<BR><B>and for my friends to help.&nbsp; All of a sudden, i flew out of
the ditch...like</B>
<BR><B>playing tug of war when the other side suddenly lets go.&nbsp; I
got up and ran as</B>
<BR><B>fast as i could to jump in the car... we left and got away from
those tracks.</B>
<BR><B>I know I yelled... the scary thing was.. I asked my friends why
they didn't</B>
<BR><B>help me get out of the ditch.&nbsp; They said they didn t hear me
yell at all for</B>
<BR><B>anything.&nbsp; I know I did... did the ghost take away my voice
then and there?</B>
<BR><B>Discussing this event afterwards with the group, we concluded I
had the</B>
<BR><B>scariest experience of the 8 or so of us who took the trip.&nbsp;
Why?&nbsp; They aren't</B>
<BR><B>sure... but I think I know.. I was the one who didn't believe any
of it would</B>
<BR><B>happen.&nbsp; The ghosts had to prove me wrong...</B>
<BR><B>They did</B>
<BR><B>Trust me, believe....they are out there, and you don't want them
to have to</B>
<BR><B>prove it to you.&nbsp; Every time I tell this story to anyone, even
typing it, my</B>
<BR><B>body stiffens up like it did that night, I feel a cold sweat, and
every shadow</B>
<BR><B>scares me.</B>
<BR><B>It scared me to tears that night.&nbsp; I returned another time
with other</B>
<BR><B>friends...they all believed at first, so they ventured out down
the path...ran</B>
<BR><B>back within seconds, scared out of their wits.</B>
<BR><B>I got as far as 5 steps from the car when I jumped back in and locked
the</B>
<BR><B>doors.&nbsp;&nbsp; Something felt wrong..like I wasn't supposed
to be there.&nbsp; I couldn't</B>
<BR><B>even look down the path.&nbsp; I travelled 4 hours.&nbsp; Didn't
even look again just to</B>
<BR><B>travel another 4 hours back home</B>

<BR><B>Cold Ghost</B>

<P><B>By: KHeil@grainbelt.com</B>

<P><B>This is the first time that I have ever written in about a ghostly</B>
<BR><B>experience. I hope it is enjoyed.</B>
<BR><B>My fiance and I used to live in an old 2 story house in St.Paul,
MN.</B>
<BR><B>This house belonged to his uncle. Many people had stayed in this
house</B>
<BR><B>as it was across the street from the bar his uncle owned. This house
had</B>
<BR><B>bad vibes from the beginning. When we first moved in we used to
joke</B>
<BR><B>about the eerie feeling we both had while separated from each other
in</B>
<BR><B>different rooms in the house. I was doing laundry in the basement
one</B>
<BR><B>day and I felt and heard someone come down the stairs. I assumed
it was</B>
<BR><B>my fiance and started talking to him. When I received no answer,
I</B>
<BR><B>thought he was playing a joke on me and trying to scare me. I finished</B>
<BR><B>what I was doing and looked through all the rooms - No on was there.</B>
<BR><B>When I got to the foot of the stairs, I walked into this spot that
was a</B>
<BR><B>good 10-15 degrees cooler than the rest of the basement. Living
in</B>
<BR><B>Minnesota in the winter you would think a door or window was open.Nope.</B>
<BR><B>I went upstairs and Scott was asleep on the couch. I woke him up
and he</B>
<BR><B>said he had been asleep for quite some time and never came downstairs.</B>
<BR><B>On other occasions, when we got up for work in the morning, the
kitchen</B>
<BR><B>window would be open about 3 inches. This window was locked by one
of us</B>
<BR><B>at night and in the morning it would be open again. It got to the
point</B>
<BR><B>we would joke about our hot-blooded ghost. When we would be asleep</B>
<BR><B>upstairs we would hear someone in the cupboards and walking around</B>
<BR><B>downstairs. Upon investigation, No one would be there.This presence
was</B>
<BR><B>not scary or mean. It just wanted someone to know that it was there.</B>

<BR><B>Night Demon?</B>

<P><B>By: EchoCo25@cs.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>

<P><B>Over 35 years ago, in our farm neighborhood there was a farm where
an old</B>
<BR><B>woman lived alone. It was said around the neighborhood that the
old lady was</B>
<BR><B>a witch. I don't know if she actually was a witch...but she was
pretty scary</B>
<BR><B>looking. She wore long dresses and always had a scarf tied over
her head. She</B>
<BR><B>walked with a cane and was kind of stooped over looking. She didn't
own a car</B>
<BR><B>and we would see her walking up and down the roads picking up cans
and</B>
<BR><B>bottles which I guess she sold. We would pass her in the mornings
on the</B>
<BR><B>school bus and whenever the bus went by her all the kids would quiet
down and</B>
<BR><B>sit silently in their seats..we wouldn't admit it...but we were
scared of her.</B>
<BR><B>As I said, she lived on a farm. She did not farm the land, but rather
cash</B>
<BR><B>rented her ground to another farmer. The land was a mix of ridge
land and</B>
<BR><B>rich bottom ground...prime farmland. There was a nice large woods
which held</B>
<BR><B>an abundance of wildlife. The farmstead itself consisted of a large
two story</B>
<BR><B>farm house, two barns and a spring house. Large old pines surrounded
the</B>
<BR><B>house. It actually was kind of a pretty farm.</B>
<BR><B>In 1963 the old lady died alone and her land was bought by a neighbor
in a</B>
<BR><B>sheriff's sale. The neighbor was never successful in finding a tenant
for the</B>
<BR><B>house...it seemed that nobody would live there very long. Then in
1966 the</B>
<BR><B>house and all outbuildings burned to the ground one night. The ensuing</B>
<BR><B>investigation never did turn up much, but to this day the rubble
of the fires</B>
<BR><B>is still there, and the site is slowly going back to nature...just
the large</B>
<BR><B>pines still mark where the farm stood.</B>
<BR><B>Along came 1967, and for me life changed, graduation, The Marines,
and Viet</B>
<BR><B>Nam...thoughts of "witchy" looking old ladies were furthest in my
mind.</B>
<BR><B>Presently after two tours, I returned to the good old USA and for
a while</B>
<BR><B>traveled around seeing the country. Soon, I became homesick and
moved back</B>
<BR><B>home to Indiana.</B>
<BR><B>Having lived in the bush for a couple of years, I guess I had a
hard time</B>
<BR><B>adjusting to life among people, so I would spend a lot of time in
the woods</B>
<BR><B>hunting, or just sitting alone in the quiet. Upon my return home
I asked the</B>
<BR><B>owner of the old witch farm if I could hunt on the ground he owned.
He</B>
<BR><B>responded affirmative...as the ground was no longer good for farming.
It</B>
<BR><B>seemed that a couple of years after the old woman died springs burst
forth</B>
<BR><B>out of the hill sides on the farm and saturated the bottom ground
ultimately</B>
<BR><B>turning the farm into a marsh. Today you can slog through the marsh
and find</B>
<BR><B>the tops of fence posts sticking out of the ground for about 10-12</B>
<BR><B>inches...fence wire still attached to the post disappearing into
the ground.</B>
<BR><B>Now I started hunting on this ground, but I was always uncomfortable
while I</B>
<BR><B>was there. I constantly felt as if I were being watched. It was
kind of</B>
<BR><B>creepy...you could just feel that something unnatural was there
with you.</B>
<BR><B>However, having survived the NVA I was not afraid of any creepy
Indiana</B>
<BR><B>woodland.</B>
<BR><B>One rainy night, in the late 70's I decided to go fox hunting. I
left my</B>
<BR><B>uncles home and ventured out into the woods with a light, a fox
call, and a</B>
<BR><B>shotgun. I knew the best hunting would be in the field behind the
old witch</B>
<BR><B>woman's farmstead, so I crossed the creek and went up the ridge
to the old</B>
<BR><B>farm. I set up and began to use my fox call. I was not afraid...I
had learned</B>
<BR><B>long ago to not let my mind get the better of me. After a while
I called in a</B>
<BR><B>gray fox, but I was not able to get a good shot at him so I held
my fire. It</B>
<BR><B>was very quiet, just the sound of the rain falling. Now I need to
explain</B>
<BR><B>that when fox hunting, a call is used to call in the fox, and a
powerful</B>
<BR><B>light with a red or amber lens cover is used to "shine" or reflect
the foxes</B>
<BR><B>eyes revealing the animals position. This is a common method used
by hunters</B>
<BR><B>everywhere.</B>
<BR><B>After I was convinced that the first fox I called in was not going
to present</B>
<BR><B>a shot, I resumed calling. After several minutes, it seemed that
I was</B>
<BR><B>hearing a noise coming from the old farmstead area. I shined my
light in the</B>
<BR><B>direction of the piles of rubble that had once been the farm buildings,
and</B>
<BR><B>suddenly I realized that my light was reflecting back a pair of
eyes...that</B>
<BR><B>seemed to be 8 - 10 feet off the ground! Okay, no need to panic...probably
a</B>
<BR><B>raccoon up in a small tree trying to get a better view of the animal
that was</B>
<BR><B>in distress. (The noise my call makes) Regardless of what it was,
this</B>
<BR><B>incident spooked me and I decided to leave. I "blew" my cover and
removed the</B>
<BR><B>red lens cover from hunting light and turned it in the direction
of the</B>
<BR><B>elevated eyes. Now an animals eyes will reflect "red" in red light...but</B>
<BR><B>normally reflect with a greenish tint in white light...however the
eyes of an</B>
<BR><B>opossum will still reflect with a reddish tint.</B>
<BR><B>The eyes that were being reflected in my light stayed red. No big
deal, just</B>
<BR><B>a possum. I gathered my gear and started across the field for the
wooded</B>
<BR><B>slope to go home. Turning my light in the direction of the red reflecting</B>
<BR><B>eyes...they were still there...unmoving...but closer! Now any animal
who's</B>
<BR><B>eyes are being reflected in light will eventually move their head
causing a</B>
<BR><B>momentary break in the reflection. These eyes were unblinking,</B>
<BR><B>unmoving...except they appeared to be following me towards the woods.
The</B>
<BR><B>scariest thing was the fact that the eyes were still about ten feet
off the</B>
<BR><B>ground! It was then I realized that there were no trees in the field
for an</B>
<BR><B>animal to be in...and no Indiana Owls can hover like a Harrier Jet!</B>
<BR><B>Suddenly this battle tested Marine panicked, and started double
timing</B>
<BR><B>towards the woods. I found the foot path that went down to the creek
crossing</B>
<BR><B>and started down it. After going about 40 meters into the woods...I
stopped</B>
<BR><B>dead in my tracks...I was suddenly paralyzed with fear! I knew if
I turned</B>
<BR><B>around that the pursuing eye shine would be behind me. Mustering
my courage I</B>
<BR><B>slowly turned, shotgun at the ready and sure as hell, the reflection
was</B>
<BR><B>there at the tree line...still about 10 feet off the ground. In
the powerful</B>
<BR><B>beam of my hunting light I should be able to see the body of whatever
was</B>
<BR><B>following me...but all I could see were the eyes, staring, almost
seeming to</B>
<BR><B>glow red.</B>
<BR><B>I was toying with the idea of shooting at what I was now sure was
an</B>
<BR><B>apparition...but a low guttural sound which came from the same location
of</B>
<BR><B>the eyes convinced me that this was not a good idea. I was overwhelmed
with a</B>
<BR><B>feeling of "get the hell out of here" so finding the feeling in
my legs, I</B>
<BR><B>broke and ran like I had never ran before. I did not even use the
stepping</B>
<BR><B>stones at the creek crossing...I just splashed through the water.
I continued</B>
<BR><B>my pace through the scrub timber until I finally found safety in
my uncles</B>
<BR><B>farm yard. At this time I heard a cry come from the timber that
I cannot</B>
<BR><B>duplicate or describe accurately...but it had a mocking quality
to it.</B>
<BR><B>What did I see in the woods that night? I don't know, it wasn't
anything</B>
<BR><B>indigenous to the Indiana woods. It was something that scared the
hell out of</B>
<BR><B>me more than an NVA B-40 rocket ever did. I know that I will never
go into</B>
<BR><B>the woods again at night. This incident happened over twenty years
ago, but I</B>
<BR><B>can't shake the image from my mind.</B>

<BR><B>GHOST STORY...The statue in the cemetary</B>

<P><B>By: guajardojm@uthscsa.edu</B>

<P><B>I was reading the many accounts of ghost hauntings and appearances
and i thought I would share mine.</B>
<BR><B>My senior year, my sister, my friend Mindy, George, Joey an myself
decided to go and search for ghost in a place that is known for many ghost
hauntings.&nbsp; I am from San Antonio and some of you may be familiar
with the tracks (school bus crash that killed several children and bus
driver) and the surrounding Espada park. On the way to the tracks there
is a cemetery about a couple of blocks off the main street that leads you
to the tracks.&nbsp; It was about 11:30 at night and we had&nbsp; heard
about the stature of the Virgin Mary that if you stare and her long enough
she starts to rock back and forth.&nbsp; This whole area is know for many
ghost because it is also an old battle field.&nbsp; The statue is located
in the cemetery near the small road that leads into the cemetery. (the
cemetery has a gate surrounding it and a chained entrance)&nbsp; Well anyway
we parked outside the fence and sat in silence to see if this was true.&nbsp;
Sure enough, slowly at first the stature started rocking.&nbsp; She sits
with her head bowed and is holding her arms as if she is caring a baby.&nbsp;
to our surprise the statue started throwing her head back.&nbsp; We started
freaking out but weren't to scared because we had seen a ghost about 15
minutes ago but that's another story.&nbsp; We sat there and my friend
noticed that the gate was completely open.&nbsp; I dont know how we would
have missed an observation like that since we have to pass the entrance
to get to park outside the gate to see the statue.&nbsp; We all decided
to go in and get a better look. (we were being stupid and just weren't
scared enough i guess)&nbsp; Slowly George began driving and as we kept
getting closer to the stature the harder she would rock.&nbsp; When we
got to where we were aligned with the statue about 10 feet, the most horrifying
thing happened the statue lifted her head and stared at us but with no
eyes and no face, it was completely black and what made everything worse
was that as soon as she looked at us, the car shut off entirely.&nbsp;
We were in histarics screaming as if we were being murdered, even George
and Joey to 18 year old&nbsp; "men"&nbsp; were screaming like girls..&nbsp;
The car was a year old and had no problems with it .&nbsp; George continually
tried restarting the car and it just would not turn on...the rest of us
are looking away from the statue trying to look and i was praying to god
to start the car.finally what felt like eternity it started and&nbsp; we
hauled ass out of the cemetery and took a right out of the entrance which
leads us further away from the main road towards the tracks.&nbsp; We were
in shock and decided to skip going to the tracks and go home and pray.&nbsp;
Not even a minute had passed since the incident occurred that we passed
the cemetery and the entrance was completely locked with chains and all.&nbsp;
as if it never happened.&nbsp; Before i wrote this story and verified it
with my sister and mindy to see if i didn't imagine any of the things i
saw.&nbsp; I didn't.&nbsp; I have several more personal experiences about
the tracks and park that i will share later.</B>

<BR><B>Premonition</B>

<P><B>By: hannahmcclutchie@xtra.co.nz</B>

<P><B>Hi my name is Hannah and I am from Hamilton ,New Zealand. I have
been reading all the ghost stories that others have experienced.I too like
every-one have many to tell,some that I have experienced personally and
others that family and friends have had.</B>
<BR><B>One such story I would like to share happened when I was about 14,It
was a Saturday night,so we were allowed to stay up late.As our parents
had already gone to bed,we decided to go to bed as well.We laid in bed
just talking when all of a sudden we saw a figure emerge from our closet.We
watched as it moved out into the hall and got up and followed,because the
lights from the street shone in we could see a figure of a woman,who had
no features but was all black like charcoal.As we watched her glide down
the hall towards our parents bedroom door which by the way was closed she
just passed right through it.Well we were so scared that we bolted straight
through the door and dived straight on top of them.They got such a fright
that they were wandering what was wrong.After we told them what we had
seen,we all got up and mum made us a milo as my sister and I refused to
go back to sleep.</B>
<BR><B>Then about 7am that morning my parents got a phone call to say that
an aunt ( whom I was very fond of ) had died tragically in a house fire.It
appeared that my uncle John was out at the time and my aunt Maria was home
with the children.Because the house was quite old the fireman said the
fire was caused by a faulty wire.Apparently when the fire started my aunt
was able to get herself and the children out but my 4yr-old cousin ran
back in to get her doll and as my aunt went in to get her the house collapsed
on them and all every-one could do was look on helplessly.They were both
burned beyond recognition and I think that what my sister and I saw that
night was her ghost as that was the same time as the tragedy was occurring.</B>

talking</B>

<P><B>Ghosts Galore and the Silver Face</B>

<P><B>By: jakicook@ozemail.com.au</B>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B>I was living in a house which had been built in the 1920's in Brisbane,</B>
<BR><B>Australia.&nbsp; It was owned by an old schoolfriend of mine who
lived up north</B>
<BR><B>with her husband. It certainly had a 'style' all it's own with casement</B>
<BR><B>windows and strange colour scheme - duck-egg blue ceiling and faded
pink</B>
<BR><B>walls.</B>
<BR><B>This house was a veritable 'Spook Central'.&nbsp; When a female
friend moved in</B>
<BR><B>to share the house, she inadvertently brought along the spirit of
her</B>
<BR><B>deceased grandmother.&nbsp; The old lady made her presence felt
by nicking off</B>
<BR><B>with her grand-daughter's key set, just to get her attention.&nbsp;
It worked.&nbsp; A</B>
<BR><B>psychic finally played as intermediary between the two. The grandmother</B>
<BR><B>didn't actually 'live' there as such - she went where her grand-daughter</B>
<BR><B>went and had a great old time reeling off names of family members
to the</B>
<BR><B>pyschic, who then relayed them to my housemate.&nbsp; Accurately,
I might add.</B>
<BR><B>Not only names, but how they were related to my housemate.</B>
<BR><B>Then there was Bob.&nbsp; A lovely old ghost who told me his name
by saying,</B>
<BR><B>'Robert, but known as Bob'.&nbsp; He was very clear that he preferred
the</B>
<BR><B>shortened version of his name.&nbsp; I never saw him with my eyes,
but sensed his</B>
<BR><B>presence. He was very protective of us two girls living in the house.&nbsp;
I</B>
<BR><B>guess he was just a gentleman.&nbsp; When my friend moved out and
a male friend</B>
<BR><B>moved in, he didn't like that one little bit.&nbsp; A photo of my
male friend sat</B>
<BR><B>in a frame on a shelf - often I'd come in and find that the photo
had been</B>
<BR><B>turned around to face the wall.&nbsp; I admonished Bob many times
for this, but</B>
<BR><B>he was stubborn and old-fashioned.&nbsp; I don't think he felt it
was appropriate</B>
<BR><B>that an unmarried woman should be living with a man in the same
house - an</B>
<BR><B>attitude which harks back to a bygone era. Sometimes the TV would
turn its</B>
<BR><B>volume up spontaneously, but I can't prove that Bob had a hand in
that.&nbsp; The</B>
<BR><B>TV repair guy said he'd never heard of it happening before. Perhaps
it was</B>
<BR><B>just a technical fault, but when I moved from the house, the TV
never did it</B>
<BR><B>again. I never felt afraid of Bob, but in the end, we thanked him
and</B>
<BR><B>encouraged him to leave and 'go towards the light', as we felt that
his</B>
<BR><B>sense of responsibility to us was misplaced and unnecessary.&nbsp;
We didn't want</B>
<BR><B>to be the excuse he used not to move on.</B>
<BR><B>I also had an encounter with a spirit, which is something different
to a</B>
<BR><B>ghost.&nbsp; A ghost is an earthbound entity that hangs around a
familiar place,</B>
<BR><B>either hoping to be noticed or refusing to believe that he/she is
dead in</B>
<BR><B>the first place.</B>
<BR><B>A spirit has passed through to 'the Other Side' and returns to interact
with</B>
<BR><B>the living, to aid as helpers and guides.</B>
<BR><B>The next part of my story occurred a couple of years ago, in that
same</B>
<BR><B>house.&nbsp; Several mornings in a row, I inexplicably snapped awake
for no</B>
<BR><B>apparent reason at the same time each morning: 1.40am.&nbsp; By
the fourth or</B>
<BR><B>fifth morning, I was pretty ticked off with the whole routine, as
I'm one of</B>
<BR><B>those people who needs their sleep, or it's Grump City.</B>
<BR><B>Anyway, I popped awake again the same time one morning and in an
exasperated</B>
<BR><B>huff, I flipped over on my other side to get comfortable in the
hope I'd</B>
<BR><B>fall asleep again quickly.&nbsp; As I flipped over, I couldn't help
but notice</B>
<BR><B>the huge face of an old woman suspended between my wardrobe and
door (a</B>
<BR><B>space of about five or six feet).&nbsp; The whole image was sparkling
silver,</B>
<BR><B>like those 'sparklers' one puts on a birthday cake - the silver
was sparking</B>
<BR><B>and radiating, with the image of the woman's face in the centre,
molded in</B>
<BR><B>3-D from the silver energy.</B>
<BR><B>She was just looking at me.&nbsp; We kind of eyeballed each other
for a few</B>
<BR><B>seconds and when my brain finally conceived of what I was seeing
(about a</B>
<BR><B>nano-second), I wasted no time in bellowing in shock.&nbsp; I flipped
back over</B>
<BR><B>again, just as the image collapsed upon itself (like water whirlpooling
down</B>
<BR><B>a plughole) and it streaked over my head like a shooting star.</B>
<BR><B>My heart was thumping so hard, I thought I'd give myself a heart
attack.&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>thought the hammering would never stop.&nbsp; By this time, I had
disappeared</B>
<BR><B>under the covers and even though I was quite warm in there, didn't
dare come</B>
<BR><B>up for air the whole night. I fell asleep quite quickly, but I think
that it</B>
<BR><B>was a protective mechanism more than anything.</B>
<BR><B>For the next few nights, I kept the light on, as well as the little
TV in my</B>
<BR><B>room.</B>
<BR><B>I felt a bit sheepish a fortnight later.&nbsp; Spirits surrounded
by silver</B>
<BR><B>indicate a positive and spiritual presence - she was not there to
do harm.</B>
<BR><B>I probably scared her more than she scared me - you should have
seen the</B>
<BR><B>pyjamas I was wearing that night!</B>
<BR><B>She was probably my protector and I behaved very badly.</B>

<BR><B>Ghosts to be?</B>

<P><B>By: Dudley1@pacbell.net</B>

<P><B>I have had a few experiences with ghosts over the years.&nbsp; Nothing</B>
<BR><B>frightening but quite startling sometimes.&nbsp; I have also had</B>
<BR><B>premonitions, so maybe this story belongs somewhere besides under</B>
<BR><B>ghosts.</B>
<BR><B>My husband and I had planned a vacation/2nd honeymoon beginning
on the</B>
<BR><B>26th of August.&nbsp; July 26th, during the day I was walking through
my</B>
<BR><B>living room when a crowd of people, and two small dogs appeared.&nbsp;
The</B>
<BR><B>people were all ages, and dressed in various outfits, like business</B>
<BR><B>suits, casual clothing, jeans and tee-shirts.&nbsp; The dogs looked
like they</B>
<BR><B>had little blankets on their backs.&nbsp; This is the first time
I had ever</B>
<BR><B>seen more than two people at a time or any animals.&nbsp; Everyone,
including</B>
<BR><B>the dogs, was wearing black.&nbsp; It looked like they were just
walking</B>
<BR><B>about somewhere, like they were some how going about normal activities.</B>
<BR><B>No seemed to particularly together with anyone else.&nbsp; It was
a</B>
<BR><B>surprising thing to see.&nbsp; For the next month, until we left
for</B>
<BR><B>vacation, I would see them every morning around 11 a.m.&nbsp; It
started</B>
<BR><B>getting pretty scary as it happened so regularly.&nbsp; For some
reason, the</B>
<BR><B>dogs frightened me the most.</B>
<BR><B>I figured maybe something was going to happen on vacation, but went
any</B>
<BR><B>way, and did not mention this to my husband.&nbsp; He would have
cancelled</B>
<BR><B>our trip until we figured this out.</B>
<BR><B>Although I did not see the people and dogs on our trip, I could
'feel'</B>
<BR><B>them near me around the same time every day.</B>
<BR><B>We got home the 10th, late afternoon, exhausted and went straight
to</B>
<BR><B>bed.&nbsp; I woke up once thinking I heard people crying.&nbsp;
The 11th my</B>
<BR><B>daughter paged me shortly after I had awakened to the crying,&nbsp;
to turn</B>
<BR><B>on the TV.&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the 11th I have not seen these people
or the dogs.&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>believe somehow I was having a premonition of what was going to
happen.</B>
<BR><B>The hardest thing about this is that I will always wonder if I could</B>
<BR><B>have saved anyone, had I figured out what I was seeing.&nbsp; I
don't think</B>
<BR><B>anyone would have believed me had I known and tried to warn anyone.&nbsp;
But</B>
<BR><B>I can't help but wonder.</B>

<BR><B>Ghosts</B>

<P><B>By: lossie877@hotmail.com</B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; I have always been intrested by ghosts, but I never
really wanted to see</B>
<BR><B>one, I just likes reading about other peoples expeirences. My first
school</B>
<BR><B>was meant to be haunted by the wife of the founder of the school,
Mr</B>
<BR><B>Huntinson. Certainly when I was there a lot of weird things happened,
though</B>
<BR><B>I myself never actually saw her, I did expeirence happnings. I can
remember</B>
<BR><B>one afternoon in class we heard a knock on the door and my teacher
called</B>
<BR><B>"Come in!" with that the door opened and the partition on the other
side of</B>
<BR><B>the room&nbsp; opened and closed as if an invisible person had walked
through the</B>
<BR><B>room. She seemed to appear when somthing was being done to the school,</B>
<BR><B>workmen saw her when they were doing the exstension and she has
been sighted</B>
<BR><B>many a time by dinnerladies. I never saw her when I was there, but
when one</B>
<BR><B>day [when I was about 12] me and my friend Issy were playing in
the village</B>
<BR><B>park with issy's dog Cloe. We were running around the back of the
community</B>
<BR><B>centre [which is by the school] when suddenly cloe started acting
strange,</B>
<BR><B>wimpering, seeming very cautious. I told issy and we looked towards
the</B>
<BR><B>school... there was a woman staring out at us from a class window.
She looked</B>
<BR><B>familar, then I gulped it was the same face that I had seen in a
photo of Mrs</B>
<BR><B>H. years back. She was in negetive [black&amp; white] I turned to
Issy and she</B>
<BR><B>must of been thinking the same as we both just ran! We diden't stop
till we</B>
<BR><B>were past the school, I am pretty sure it was her, no-one was in
the school</B>
<BR><B>then there were no cars nothing! It was so strange! Mrs H. is also
suppposed</B>
<BR><B>to haunt the old rectory as well so she is very much a village ghost!

<BR><B>Goings on at our House...</B>

<P><B>By: Reynestorm10@cs.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>

<P><B>We have lived in our house for 3 years last month and have had many</B>
<BR><B>"expierences". Right after we moved in my son who at the time had
just turned</B>
<BR><B>one the week before was playing and had that "spaced out" look on
his face,</B>
<BR><B>so I picked him up and said what's wrong Sage and he looked past
me and plain</B>
<BR><B>as day said,"monsters". That was the beginning.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; The next major occurance happened with my daughter. Kayli
was 5 when we</B>
<BR><B>moved in and I went through heer closet to pick out the things that
she had</B>
<BR><B>outgrown to bag up for Goodwill. One&nbsp; of the outfits that I
put away was a</B>
<BR><B>little pink dress with flowers on the front that had became too
small. I put</B>
<BR><B>all of the clothes in plastic garbage bags in our utility room.
A couple of</B>
<BR><B>weks later, I woke up to get Kayli ready for school. I went upstairs
into her</B>
<BR><B>room. She has a toy box beside her door. On top of the toy box neatly
folded</B>
<BR><B>was the pink dress and a pair of white sandles. I woke her up and
asked if</B>
<BR><B>she got them out of the&nbsp; bag and she had no idea what I was
talking about, so</B>
<BR><B>I asked my husband and he also said he didnt do it. Later I went
to put them</B>
<BR><B>away again and they were gone. Again, I asked if anyone had moved
them,</B>
<BR><B>again...no. Several days later I was vacuming in her room and something
was</B>
<BR><B>in the way under the bed..I looked and there was the dress and shoes!</B>
<BR><B>Again...no one knew how they got there!</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; We have always heard noises like people walking upstairs,
when everyone is</B>
<BR><B>downstairs. Things get "misplaced" and then suddenly appear where
they</B>
<BR><B>belong. Several times if anything is lost it has almost become a
joke, we</B>
<BR><B>will say, "I sure wish I knew where ---- is"...and then it always
appears!</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; Last Christmas we were all sitting in the living room watching
t.v. Our</B>
<BR><B>Christmas tree was in the corner and all of a sudden an ornament
flew off</B>
<BR><B>about 6 feet through the air soon followed by another one. The next
week we</B>
<BR><B>had friends over and we were telling them about that incident and
while we</B>
<BR><B>were telling the story 2 more flew off, in front of everyone!</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; Last year on Sept.26th we were at the lake looking for arrowheads
and we</B>
<BR><B>found the body of a murdered man. Two weeks earlier we were at the
same spot</B>
<BR><B>but the water was up much higher and I found a watch. I gave it
to my</B>
<BR><B>husband, he got a new band for it and proceeded&nbsp; to wear it.
when we found</B>
<BR><B>the body, it was in the spot I had found the watch.(the police say
that he</B>
<BR><B>had been there for about 6 weeks, since he was under the water he
was very</B>
<BR><B>well preserved) After we found the man the initials PRG started
showing up on</B>
<BR><B>our computer. the man we found name was Wallace Ray Guthrey, my
mother and</B>
<BR><B>Dad both went to school with him and my mom told me his nickname
in school</B>
<BR><B>was Possum. That would explain the P and then R and G I think are
the Ray and</B>
<BR><B>the Guthrey. So he is added to the house.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; Yesterday I woke up with my husband at 4:20am for him to
go to work. He</B>
<BR><B>went into the bathroom and I went to the kitchen to get a drink.
When I</B>
<BR><B>turned on the light I realized all of our cabinet doors and drawers
were</B>
<BR><B>open. All of them! Now these cabinets have child safety locks on
them that</B>
<BR><B>the kids CANNOT open. Not only were they all open, they were all
opened the</B>
<BR><B>same exact distance. All the drawers were opened exactly the same
amount. Now</B>
<BR><B>this freaked me out!!! Even the island in the middle of the kitchen
cabinet</B>
<BR><B>doors were all open!</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;This morning my husband was outside burning leaves and I walked
by the</B>
<BR><B>bathroom to see the closet doors both close at the same time!</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;The other night my husband was outside feeding the dogs (without
a shirt)</B>
<BR><B>and he felt something lick his back!!!!!! I hear my name all the
time being</B>
<BR><B>called when nobody else is home. My husband has also seen the outline
of what</B>
<BR><B>he says looks like a man in a tophat. I have seen a black figuire
floating on</B>
<BR><B>the stairs.This very moment the dust on the top of my tv in our
room says</B>
<BR><B>Celeste??!!!! I dont know anyone by that name!</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; We are not sure how many different spirits we have, but they
dont seem to</B>
<BR><B>be doing anything "bad", they are just being. Historically the property</B>
<BR><B>behind our house is the Spainish Trail where the settlers drove
their wagons</B>
<BR><B>to settle in this area. You can still see the indentions in the
earth....</B>

<BR><B>Good Spirits</B>

<P><B>By: momo@ihug.co.nz</B>

<P><B>I am a 21 year old female from Wellington, New Zealand. As far as
I am aware, none of my family can see or hear spirits (my father is especially
skeptical), and so I have not really shared my experiences with them.</B>
<BR><B>Since I was 14, I have had a best friend called Joann. Now Jo, has
always been able to see spirits, and speak to them also - her first experience
was when she was about 4 years old. Her beloved pet rabbit had just passed,
and as she lay awake in bed that night, she clearly saw the image of her
pet rabbit jump through the closed window, hop across the floor, and jump
into the picture of himself that Jo had drawn that afternoon. She claims
she felt a wonderful happiness at seeing her rabbit - even though she knew
he was dead.</B>
<BR><B>Joann and I are pretty tight, and when she first told me about all
of this I was fascinated..... I wanted to speak to them too! Joann told
me that the spirits felt I wasn't ready, but when I was I would have the
ability. You can imagine my impatience!</B>
<BR><B>About 2 years ago when I had just moved to Wellington, from my hometown
Wanganui, I got a job at the local Burger King. The first two shifts went
well, but one night when I was on closing shift (there are usually 5 of
us on a close, and this is when the hard work really takes place - ever
wonder why all that chrome looks so shiny?!) I was sent upstairs to clean
the bathrooms. The building that this Burger King was in was an old building
- large and made of concrete bricks. It echoed horribly upstairs, and as
I was cleaning the men's toilets, I felt as if someone was watching me.
I turned around, and couldn't see anyone but I couldn't shake the feeling
that someone was watching me. Well, the spirits must have finally decided
that I was ready..... and their timing couldn't have been worse. I turned
back around, and whilst I couldn't see anything with my eyes, with my mind
I got the impression of a man in his late 30's dressed all in black wearing
a bowler or top hat of some description. He wasn't saying anything, or
moving in any way, but I got the distinct impression that he was aware
of me, and he was having a good old look. Then I had a mental flash of
horses and carts, dirt roads and busy streets. My conclusion? He was trying
to communicate with me on some level and I feel that he was alive in the
late 1800's of early 1900's - before the invention of motor cars anyway.
He was unmarried, and lonely - I know this but don't ask me how. He was
also a businessman, maybe a banker or something. He was accidentally killed
somehow, and I feel that for some reason he was connected to the building
that we were in.</B>
<BR><B>He never scared me (apart from giving me a bit of a shock), but
I was sure he did not approve of people invading his "space". I never did
offer to clean those toilets again....</B>
<BR><B>After this first one, the floodgates seemed to open. On transferring
to another Burger King in the region, I had disturbing emotions of hopelessness
and anger at work and later found out that the house that was on the site
before BK grabbed it, was the scene of a violent murder. The house was
destroyed soon after the murder took place.</B>
<BR><B>I would suddenly start talking to a particular girl at work about
"Telling J". I had no idea what this was about. This was followed by "tell
mum to stop crying. I'm fine" and "get rid of that man of yours - he's
no good". As I was the new girl, and didn't really know anyone, there was
no way I could have known what this was about in relation to this particular
girl. She dragged me outside one time on our break and started crying,
saying that her brother had died in a car crash years ago, and that this
was him, because he called her by his special nickname. The spirit of her
dead brother was actually telling me what to say to her in relation to
his death, and messages that he wanted to pass on to his family. Initially,
I was upset, and worried that somehow, I was making it all up. But this
girl was sure that I wasn't as I was saying things that only she and her
brother would know about. To say I was honored would be an understatement.</B>
<BR><B>I have since talked to my dead great-grandmother (she was a wonderfully
sarcastic woman - I love chatting to her), and the grandmother and relations
of various friends. I have only occasionally seen random spirits... the
scariest of which was what seemed like a shadow on the wall of a building
in the dead of night. A group of us had wandered up to our old intermediate
school, and as we got nearer and nearer, a terrible feeling of dread seemed
to envelop both Jo and I. No one else seemed affected at all, but when
we got to the gate of the school, we saw a large black shadow on the wall
in the shape of a person - Jo and I would later tell each other that we
felt a feeling of total hatred surround us. This had some effect on the
others apparently, but being typical Kiwi males, they "Weren't scared of
no shadow!"..... that was up until a car drove past, and as the headlights
shone onto the wall, all the shadows disappeared - except the one shaped
like a person. I've never seen a group of hard kiwi men run as fast and
as scared as we all did that night.</B>
<BR><B>When I moved into a bedsit in a group of council flats, I had many
strange experiences. The first of which was on my first night in the new
bedsit. I woke in the middle of the night and at the back of my mind was
an impression that something wanted me out. From the bathroom strange tapping
noises were heard, and I slept fitfully that night. This continued for
a couple of weeks, and after a particularly bad nights' sleep, I sat up
in bed and said "Now look here. I am paying the rent on this room, and
I am not about to be scared off. I respect you for what you are, and I
realize that you may want the place to yourself. But for now, I live here
aswell. One day I will move out and you can have the room to yourself again.
Until that day, I ask that you respect me just as I respect you. I am more
than happy to share with you, and I will not attempt to remove you. All
I ask is that you do not try to hurt me or my pets, and to let me sleep."
As strange as this speech may seem, it worked, and I was not bothered again,
although I still felt the presence of the old man. But this time it was
a tolerant presence. Upon telling this story to the old lady next door,
she told me that the man who used to live there had been there a good many
years until he had died in hospital of pneumonia. She told me that he was
a nice old man, but he had liked his privacy.</B>
<BR><B>Another was when I was visiting a friend on the floor above me.
We were out on the balcony talking and it would have been about 10 at night.
My mind saw a man standing at the other end of the balcony, staring at
us. I couldn't sense his facial features except for his eyes. They were
hard and cold and an overwhelming feeling of hatred and anger rushed through
me. I was so shaken, I had to go inside. I had a horrible feeling that
if we had stayed out there any longer, he would have harmed us in some
way. Once again the old lady next door confirmed that a man had died in
the flat where this spirit was standing outside of, and that he was a hateful,
spiteful person when alive. He also hated women and would scare them for
fun. I have never forgotten that feeling of hate, and I don't think I ever
will.</B>
<BR><B>On the whole, through both my experiences, and the experiences of
my friends I believe that yes, evil spirits exist. But I also feel that
the good ones far outweigh the bad ones. And to have a perfectly 'normal'
conversation with one is a very humbling experience. I will never stop
believing, and when I have children of my own, I will teach them to respect
and honor those that have passed - because one day we will join them.</B>

<BR><B>Grandmothers has Passed but I can Still see Her</B>

<P><B>By: TOMAAlexdiane1@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>The day my grandmother died I was very sad.I was also very young.Not
more than eleven years old.I had a cousin who was about one month at the
time.I did not know that my parents would be so busy for the entire week
following her passing.My mom arranged for a sitter to watch my cousin and
I in our own neighborhood.She thought this would make things easier for
the both of us to accept.My cousin had never gone to sleep anywhere other
than my grandmothers house.So when it was time for her nap she began to
get quite fussy and very unruly.Our sitter suggested that I take her to
our grandmothers and try to get her to take a nap and maybe take one myself.I
thought the idea was pretty good and walked with my cousin the short block
back to the familiar house.While I sat on the sofa rocking her back and
forth she started to dose aff and soon so did I.I am not sure how long
I was asleep or exactly what woke me but when I opened my eyes my cousin
was not lying beside me where I had lay her before drifting off.I became
panicky and began running through the house looking for her.I finally found
her lying on my grandmothers bed covered up with the quilt that my grandmother
had made for her.Now this would not be odd if it were not that she was
upstairs and that she was only one month old so she could not walk yet.Well
needless to say no one believed me when I went home that night and tried
to tell my parents.They all laughed at me and said I was crazy.I gradually
forgot about it and did not think anymore about it until I grew up.I found
it quite hard to swallow myself.I finally got married had a few children
of my own.I thought I had turned out to be pretty normal.I had put all
of the scary things behind me...or so I thought.I was celebrating my husbands
birthday one year and to be honest I had been drinking a little.I do not
think this is what caused me to see what I saw though.I was going into
the house to get my husband another beer and happened to look out into
the woods that surrounded our home.I sobered up immediately.I saw my grandmother
walking in the woods and she was laughing and dancing just as if she were
there enjoying the party with the rest of us.I thought I was going crazy.I
maean lets be honest...Would my husband have believed me if I had gone
running yelling that I had seen my dead grandmother in the woods?Of course
not he would have locked me up in an assylum for sure.I did not say anything
until later that evening.Since then I have not seen her again and to tell
the truth I would not mind seeing her.I loved my granny very much and never
really was afraid when these things happened.I knew that if it were her
that she would not hurt me.If she is still watching me I want her to know
that I am going to be okay and if she feels that she has to come back and
check on me every now and then I will always leave my door and my heart
open and unlocked.</B>

<P><B>Haunted College Dorm</B>

<P><B>By: Damia433@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>I attended SUNY College at Oneonta. It was 9 years ago. I was 19
at the time.&nbsp; Some of it's buildings were built in 1948.&nbsp; I lived
in two of them, Tobey Hall and Wilbur Hall.&nbsp; They were both haunted.</B>
<BR><B>The right hand side, first floor of Wilbur Hall was haunted.&nbsp;
The lights were always too dim, flickered on and off, the hallway was too
cold.&nbsp; Anyone who walked or lived on that hall felt hairs go up on
the backs of their necks; they felt people standing by them when there
was no one visibly there; noises and thumps were heard constantly.</B>
<BR><B>I lived on the Third Floor, right side of the building.&nbsp; My
roommate was known to frequent other friend's dorms, leaving me by myself
most of the time.&nbsp; I liked the peace and quiet until one winter night.&nbsp;
I was getting ready for bed, brushing my hair in the mirror and saw a silver
orb floating next to me.&nbsp; When I looked behind and next to me, there
was nothing there.&nbsp; I looked in the mirror, and there it was, floating
again.&nbsp; I ran screaming from the room and slept in the Lounge for
the night.</B>
<BR><B>I went back to the room the next day, feeling no presence of what
was there the night before.&nbsp; I went about my business as usual, and
when nightfall came, I didn't think of the previous night's encounter.&nbsp;
I didn't know how sorry I'd be for going back into the room to sleep.</B>
<BR><B>I woke up in the middle of the night feeling someone kneeling over
me (My bed was turned over so I was up higher than a normal bed.&nbsp;
I needed a stool to climb into bed and I'm average height).&nbsp; I felt
a cord go around my neck and tried to pull it away.&nbsp; I felt it cutting
into my fingers, but wasn't strong enough to pull it away completely.&nbsp;
I thought someone had broken into my room and was strangling me.&nbsp;
The more I struggled, the more pressure I felt go around my neck.&nbsp;
I screamed, managed to finally break free of the cord around my neck, in
the process spraining my hand.&nbsp; The pressure of someone kneeling over
me was gone.&nbsp; I sat up, breathing hard, looking for someone hiding
in the shadows.&nbsp; I thought I'd scared away whoever was attacking me
when I screamed.&nbsp; I reached for my TV remote, turned on the TV, which
shed enough light to see by.&nbsp; No one was in my room.&nbsp; The door
was still locked, and my hand hurt like crazy.&nbsp; I realized then I'd
been attacked by a ghost.&nbsp; What else could it be?&nbsp; At that point,
I was elated that I won, but also frightened beyond belief and wanted out
of the room, but was too chicken to run to the lounge, as it was around
3 am and anyone could be lurking outstide.</B>
<BR><B>Before these two incidents, I was visited by a man, who stood in
the middle of the room, bathed in a soft light.&nbsp; He wore a brown leather
jacket and light colored pants.&nbsp; He was talking to me, but I couldn't
hear what he said, other than he wanted me out.&nbsp; I screamed at him
to speak louder, in the process waking my roomate up.&nbsp; The man disappeared.</B>
<BR><B>I don't know if it was the same man who appeared to me as the silver
orb and then again as my attacker.&nbsp; I will never know.&nbsp; Christmas
break came and when I came back, the apparitions were gone.</B>
<BR><B>My biggest problem at the time was explaining to the Wellness Center
nurses how I sprained my hand.&nbsp; I told them I hit it against the wall
in the middle of the night.&nbsp; I wasn't ready myself to admit I had
been attacked by a ghost.</B>

<BR><B>Haunted House in Banida</B>

<P><B>By: CalicoRose2112@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>In the late summer of 1988 my husband and I had to move from the
house were were renting because our landlord had sold his house and would
be moving in the house were in. We had been looking for a house to rent
and had just about given up when we heard about a house that was for rent
in Banida, just fifteen minutes up the highway from us. I contacted the
people who owned the house and made arrangements for my husband and I to
go and take a look at it. That afternoon we drove up to Banida to see the
house. It was a large old house that had been added onto over the years.
The house was surrounded by a grassy yard and had several large trees around
it. It had a very large, long living room with a huge picture window that
looked out over the yard. The house had once been the Banida post office
and the old mail boxes were still there in the front entry way. There were
three bedrooms, one which the owners were using for storage and a very
large kitchen and laundry room.&nbsp; Where the kitchen was had originally
been a log cabin where the owners family had lived many, many years before.
There was a long narrow hall next to the kitchen which led down to a small
basment that was unusable. In the spring when the snow melted the basement
always got flooded. There was a musty smell that drifted up from the basement.
We loved the house and the rent was really cheap so we rented the house
and moved in about a week later.</B>
<BR><B>As soon as we moved in I began experiencing unusual things. Whenever
I was alone in the house I would hear a door opening and closing and the
sounds of footsteps walking down the narrow hall that led to the basement.
When I went looked down the hall nobody was there and the door that led
out into the driveway was shut and locked as I had left it. As soon as
I walked away and sat back down in the living room I'd hear it again. There
were times when I would hear what sounded like a ball bouncing across the
roof. When I'd go outside to see if someone was there...I'd find nothing.
One afternoon I heard the sounds of children playing outside in the back
yard. The owners have eight children and figuring it was them I was hearing
I went outside to say hello. As soon as I opened the door the sounds stopped
and there wasn't anybody there. This happened many times. I heard these
things every day and got used to hearing them and soon didn't pay much
attention to them. In the spring of 1989 my mother died after a battle
with cancer. The owners had gone out of town for the weekend and not having
a telephone we depended on them to recieve messages for us. My mother had
passed away that afternoon about 1:30 and I didn't learn about it until
the next day when the owners came home and recieved a phone call from my
father. The night before I learned of her death, I woke in the middle of
the night. Except for the night light that was shining across the livingroom
and into the bedroom the house was completely dark. I became aware that
somebody was standing next to the bed on my side. I could make out a black
silhouette of someone standing in front of the bedroom window. I wasn't
alarmed and rolled over and went back to sleep thinking "It's just mom."
The next afternoon the owners came over and gave me the news concerning
my mother. I knew right away that it had indeed been mom in my room the
night before.</B>
<BR><B>That summer, some really strange things began happening in the house.
Things I had no explanation for. That summer my husband and I left for
a three day family reunion up St. Charles Canyon near Bear Lake. We had
two house cats and two cats that lived outside and two dogs and we left
our landlord's daughter Cindy to take care of them while we were away.
When we left, except for a pile of clean laundry I had left on the couch..the
house was clean. When I came home I found a mess. When I walked into the
kitchen, a large tupperware container full of brownies, that I had put
on the top of the refrigerator was tipped upside down in the middle of
the kitchen floor. The floor was covered with kitty litter making the floor
dusty and gravelly. When I walked into the living room my mouth dropped
open at what I found. Flies. Thousands and thousands of them. They filled
the air and were all over the curtains and furniture I found several of
my pictures knocked off the walls. A few pictures remained on the walls
hanging at odd angles. I found my big black tom cat pepper, who lived outside,
hiding under the couch with a look of sheer terror on his face. I had no
idea how he had gotten in the house. When we left I saw him playing in
the grass with my other tom cat beside the house. I grabbed him and put
him outside and hollered at my husband to come in the living room. He couldn't
believe his eyes when he saw all the flies. I threw open the windows and
they flew to the windows in huge mounds where I trapped them and killed
them. I had to pull the screens out and when I did they fell out in huge
ugly black mounds to the ground below. When I got the house cleaned back
up and had gotten rid of the last of the flies, I went over to my landlords
house and told them what I had found when I came home. Cindy didn't have
any idea how Pepper had gotten in the house and told me the house was fine
when she was there. When I asked if they had ever had fly problems before
they said no. A few laters the event would repeat itself.</B>
<BR><B>I was home alone and baking some cookie bars. The oven had a tendency
to cook hot and I had to keep an eye on it whenever I did any baking. Well
I was watching t.v. and had forgotten that I had something baking in the
oven when I smelled something burning. Remembering my cookies I jumped
up and ran into the kitchen and pulled my cookies out. They were slightly
burned but not a total loss. Well I put them out to cool and returned to
finish watching my t.v. program. When I walked into the living room I stopped
dead in my tracks. Where there had been no flies a moment before, suddenly
there were thousands of them, stuck to the walls, windows and curtains
and circling the room. Once again I threw open the windows and once again
they flocked to them and I trapped them and killed them and they fell in
huge black clumps to the ground when I pulled off the screens. When I told
my landlord that it had happened again she didn't know what to make of
it. We moved from there two months later into a trailer house a few miles
away when the landlords told us we had to move because their cousin and
her family were moving into the house. That move was difficult because
at the time of the move I was recovering from major surgery. But I was
glad to be out of the house. Now the landlords son and daughter in law
live there with their three boys. I have asked her if she ever had problems
with flies or experienced anything odd in the house. She told me no. I
don't know what brought those flies into the house but I hope I never experince
that kind of thing again. It was digusting.</B>

<BR><B>Haunted House in Yorkshire</B>

<P><B>By: Garrymarshall7@aol.com</B>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B>These incidents I am about to tell you about happened to my sister
and her</B>
<BR><B>family when she bought her new house three years ago. They needed
a bigger</B>
<BR><B>home due to the family growing and after a short while looking,
found their</B>
<BR><B>ideal home in a nice cul-de-sac that dated to the 1920's and ended
up buying</B>
<BR><B>it off an old lady who lived alone. Andrew, my sisters husband,
at that time</B>
<BR><B>worked regularly away from home because he was a heavy goods driver
for his</B>
<BR><B>fathers company so my sister was often left on her own in the house
with the</B>
<BR><B>kids. It started off with noises in the house she could not explain,
but it</B>
<BR><B>was with andrew that the sightings started to occur. He was home
one evening</B>
<BR><B>watching the T.V. sitting&nbsp; on the coutch, when occording to
my sister, he</B>
<BR><B>suddenly sat bolt right up staring at the T.V.&nbsp; When she asked
him what was</B>
<BR><B>wrong, he just kept shaking his head saying nothing was the matter.
He kept</B>
<BR><B>staring so she asked him again where upon he told her to put the
kids to bed.</B>
<BR><B>When she came down, he said that as he was watching the telly, a
face of an</B>
<BR><B>old man just appeared next to the T.V. set and stared at him.My
sister</B>
<BR><B>laughed it off, but after a while could tell he was serious. The
next</B>
<BR><B>incident was when andrew was putting down a new floor covering in
the</B>
<BR><B>kitchen. He was stood with his back to the kitchen sink when he
said he was</B>
<BR><B>pushed from behind, when he looked around there was no one else
in the room</B>
<BR><B>with him. The third incident involved her five year old son who
had gone to</B>
<BR><B>bed one evening. He hadn't been in bed more than 10-15 minutes when
she heard</B>
<BR><B>him come "flying" down the stairs and burst through the living room
door.</B>
<BR><B>Thomas was crying badly and it took her quite a while to calm him
down and</B>
<BR><B>get him to talk, where upon he told her that an old man had walked
into his</B>
<BR><B>bedroom and just stood and stared at him. My sister by now was a
bit shook up</B>
<BR><B>over it and a few days later was out in the garden talking to her
new</B>
<BR><B>neighbour, an old lady&nbsp; in her late 70's.During the conversation
she asked</B>
<BR><B>the old lady if she knew of anything "odd" about the house's history
where</B>
<BR><B>the lady replied she didn't and what did she mean by odd. My sister
told her</B>
<BR><B>about the incidents in the house and then described the face of
the old man</B>
<BR><B>that andrew had seen. This caused the old lady to stagger back a
bit and then</B>
<BR><B>tell my sister that she had just described "George". Apparently,
he lived in</B>
<BR><B>the house for many years but in the mid 1970's had died in there.He
had come</B>
<BR><B>down to the kitchen sink in the early hours of the morning to get
a drink of</B>
<BR><B>water due to chest pains but whilst down stairs, suffered a massive
heart</B>
<BR><B>attack and died on the kitchen floor.</B>
<BR><B>After a while they had a burglar alarm fitted with "motion detectors"
in</B>
<BR><B>every room but not long after, they had to have it disconnected
because the</B>
<BR><B>alarm would go off regularly in the early hours of the morning and
the</B>
<BR><B>neighbours started to complain.</B>
<BR><B>Many times my sister was alone in the house when the alarm went
off and on</B>
<BR><B>going to the consul to turn it off, the light of the "motion detector"
in the</B>
<BR><B>kitchen would be flashing to tell her it had been activated. The
final straw</B>
<BR><B>was when andrew decided to put some new radiators in the kitchen
and was</B>
<BR><B>under the floor. He said as he worked away he suddenly felt cold
and stopped</B>
<BR><B>work because he had the feeling someone was behind him. He wouldn't
turn</B>
<BR><B>around but just started to crawl back towards the trap door. As
he did this,</B>
<BR><B>he said he distinctly heard a voice say " you have done a good job
there"</B>
<BR><B>which obviously caused him to panic. My sister said she was at the
other end</B>
<BR><B>of the room when he came out of the trap door like a bat out of
hell and very</B>
<BR><B>shaken. Due to other things happening in the house they decided
to sell it</B>
<BR><B>and move.</B>
<BR><B>Andrew has recently told me that the single mother who bought the
house from</B>
<BR><B>them has put it back on the market to be sold after only been in
there one</B>
<BR><B>year.</B>

<P><B>Haunted House</B>

<P><B>By: JENKS1960@aol.com</B>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B>We moved into a house that was about 100 years old and had not been
lived in for about 20 years.&nbsp;&nbsp; The rumor around town was that&nbsp;
it was haunted.&nbsp; I did not believe this, even though I had grown up
with people that had spent nights in the house and said that they experienced
it first hand.</B>
<BR><B>We moved in to the house when my children were ages 5 and 8 yrs.&nbsp;
The first night in the house I was very nervous.&nbsp; I could not go to
sleep.&nbsp; When&nbsp; I did almost fall asleep, I heard a man's voice
in my head.&nbsp;&nbsp; I know this sounds very strange,&nbsp; but it was
like someone else's thought was in my head, and it said a man's name.&nbsp;
I can't remember the name, only that it started with a "B".</B>
<BR><B>We finally settled in.&nbsp; The girls complained of doors locking
them in rooms.&nbsp;&nbsp; We had gone out of town for the weekend.&nbsp;&nbsp;
My youngest daughter got a virus.&nbsp; When we got home , she went to
bed.&nbsp;&nbsp; About 5:30 am I heard what I thought was one of my children
calling out for me.&nbsp; when&nbsp; I checked on them they were sound
asleep,&nbsp; not even stirring.&nbsp; I went from my youngest daughter's
room into the hall to go to my room and I saw what I thought were car lights
refleckting in my window on the stair landing.&nbsp; But as I watched the
two lights were bobbing up and down independent of each other.&nbsp; They
went down the steps, turned at the landing and continued down the steps
until they disappeared through a door.</B>
<BR><B>Another time, at about 5:30 am again,&nbsp; I was awakened by someone
touching my leg,&nbsp; I thought it was one of my children, but no one
was there.&nbsp; I also experienced the man's voice in my head one more
time.</B>
<BR><B>Near Halloween&nbsp; of the same year, I was in the car with my
children when my 5 yr old complained that she always felt that someone
was watching her when she was in bed.&nbsp;&nbsp; This scared me,&nbsp;
it was time to get out.</B>
<BR><B>We bought a brandnew house and moved out.&nbsp;&nbsp; When we had
moved in the old house I had 2 cats.&nbsp; They were so scared in the old
house they didn't come out from under the couch for a week.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I thought this was a reaction from moving.&nbsp; When we moved into the
new house they were at home right away.&nbsp; I feel that they senced something.</B>
<BR><B>After we moved out,&nbsp; my mother in law confided that she had
an experience in the house while getting my children off to school.&nbsp;&nbsp;
It was a foggy moring and not yet light out.&nbsp; She heard someone come
in the house.&nbsp; She walked into the dining room and could see some
one in what was called the parlor.&nbsp; She thought it was my mother,
who liked to get up early and walk every morning for exercise.&nbsp; When
she spoke my mother's name the presence went up the steps.&nbsp; She thought
my mother had gone up to check on my children, but when she never came
down, my mother in law went up looking for her and no one was there.</B>
<BR><B>She became concerned and called my mother to make sure she was alright.&nbsp;&nbsp;
My mother confermed her calling.&nbsp; She said she wondered why she called
so early for no apparent reason.&nbsp; My husband also experienced hearing
what he thought was the children calling out for him and they were asleep.</B>
<BR><B>For about 6 months after this I had night mares about the house.&nbsp;
I hope I never experience this again.</B>

<P><B>My House is Haunted</B>

<P><B>By: kcwea@juno.com</B>

<P><B>Some people think that we are crazy, but I believe you will believe
that</B>
<BR><B>it is real.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;In 1972 my parents purchased a house and we moved in.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I was 5 at that</B>
<BR><B>time, during the 5 years that we lived there so many stange and
terrible</B>
<BR><B>things happened.&nbsp; right after moving in, we had a sense that
we were not</B>
<BR><B>alone.&nbsp; Late at night my sister and I would see a man standing
over us</B>
<BR><B>while in our beds. ( I got accustomed to sleeping under the bed
for</B>
<BR><B>years.) We would lock our door and he would unlock it,&nbsp; we
would put</B>
<BR><B>things away and he would take them back out.&nbsp; He was always
taking things</B>
<BR><B>and placing them in the exact same spot a week later.&nbsp; We asked
neighbors</B>
<BR><B>about the house shortly after moving in when we arrived home from</B>
<BR><B>shopping and it sounded like there was a party&nbsp; going on inside,
when the</B>
<BR><B>door was opened there was nothing,&nbsp; just silence.&nbsp; That
was when we</B>
<BR><B>started asking questions about the property.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; One neighbor, who had lived next door for over 50 years,
told us a</B>
<BR><B>heart wrenching story.</B>
<BR><B>It seems that a family of 4 had lived in the house in the late 60's
to</B>
<BR><B>the early 70's.&nbsp; Man, wife and two sons.&nbsp; In 1969&nbsp;
one of the boys was</B>
<BR><B>crossing the street and was hit and killed by a speeding car,&nbsp;
the other</B>
<BR><B>child was also killed in the same spot, same time,</B>
<BR><B>same way one year to the date.&nbsp; The mother was so upset, that
a few days</B>
<BR><B>later she hung herself in the living room.&nbsp;&nbsp; The father
came home found</B>
<BR><B>his wife and he&nbsp; shot himself in the kitchen.&nbsp; This was
2 years before we</B>
<BR><B>purchased the house, and it had been on the market since the tragedies.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; I can not say as to whether this spirit was content with
us or not.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;For instance, at the age of 8 and my sister 11, she got sick
and was</B>
<BR><B>admitted into the hospital as D.O.A. . Thank god the doctors did
not give</B>
<BR><B>up, they saved her life and gave her back to us.&nbsp; She was diagnosed
with</B>
<BR><B>Encephalitis, a deadly disese during that time and still is.&nbsp;
She was in</B>
<BR><B>the bathroom when I found her that night, and in the mirror appeared
a</B>
<BR><B>showdow of a man's head.&nbsp; We have since destroyed that mirror,
but the</B>
<BR><B>shadow was never there before her sickness.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; 2nd instance, We moved and rented the house out to my aunt.&nbsp;
One</B>
<BR><B>evening my uncle had went to retrieve some items he had in the garage.</B>
<BR><B>Two of the items were antique shot guns. (We have never been able
to find</B>
<BR><B>shells for these two guns and they are in shadow boxes now).&nbsp;
As my uncle</B>
<BR><B>picked up one of the guns, the other slipped and went off.&nbsp;
He was shot</B>
<BR><B>in the neck and shoulder, and almost died from the injuries.&nbsp;
Thing is</B>
<BR><B>there was no proof either gun had been fired, police could not find
any</B>
<BR><B>powder residue anywhere, but they concluded that the shot came from
that</B>
<BR><B>caliber of gun.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; 3rd instance,&nbsp; I moved back into the house in
1986, shortly after the</B>
<BR><B>birth of my son.&nbsp; After being there a week, (it was extremely
hot that</B>
<BR><B>summer) I had a feeling something was wrong with the baby, I went
into</B>
<BR><B>the room to see that he was blue and ice cold,</B>
<BR><B>as I rushed him to the hospital he was coming around, at the hospital</B>
<BR><B>they said nothing was wrong with him and sent me home.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; I moved that night.&nbsp; i only go into that house if a
renter moves out,</B>
<BR><B>(nobody ever lives there long).&nbsp;&nbsp; I still get locked into
the rooms, I</B>
<BR><B>feel his presence all around me and the hair stands up on my arms.&nbsp;
We</B>
<BR><B>have never been able to get a minister to go in the house, We always
get</B>
<BR><B>told that evil lurks there.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are many other instances but these

<BR><B>" Big Red Brick House"</B>

<P><B>By: joangorak@aol.com</B>

<P><B>I am 80 plus years old at the present time. But when I was in my
early 20's I married a very loving, handsome man and we moved into our
first home, which was a Big Red Brick house in a small town. The house
was separated into two half's, an upstairs and a downstairs..We lived in
the bottom half. Soon after moving into the house we gave birth to a beautiful
daughter. Our life was fulfilled. My husband and I still as much in love
as the day I set eyes upon him and he was ever so proud of his little Joy
Lynn (Our Daughter).. Our life couldn't be better at this point. Until
one day during a hot summer the family above us had to move due to work
and I was asked if I could clean and paint the upper half and try to find
a new family to move in. I cleaned a little one day and then decided to
start again early morning when the sun wasn't beating through the windows
so. And so I did, I started at 5 a.m and decided to take a break and do
of my own chores that needed tended too.. I left the door open that led
to the upper half of the home and began to wash some clothes and when I
went out in the yard to hang them I thought nothing about my very curious
5 year old daughter being alone in the house, I was only right out the
side door. I went back in the house to make lunch for her before I began
to clean again and called for her and got no answer, I began searching
for her and she was nowhere to be found. After searching the streets I
called my husband home and then contacted the authorities. They found our
daughter, she had explored through the door that went to the upper half
of the house and climbed up into the attic and when they had found her
she was dead. I was in shock, I was only outside for a short time, and
she had no marks on her body to show cause, and the medical people couldn't
even explain what the cause of death was. This was the hardest thing I
even had to endure. One night while lying in bed trying to re enact the
day out in my head and figure out what could have happen, my husband made
a strange n! ! oise and yelled "Do you see her?!" I sat up and asked what
he was seeing and he swore my daughter had entered the room. I assured
him no one was there and his mind was playing tricks on him because he
missed her so much. that was one of many long tearful nights and it happened
several times a week, until exactly 8 months to the day that our daughter
died, when i was leaving to go to the mill i found my husband's lifeless
body lying on the basement stairs that led to the outside and in his hands
tightly clutched was the doll my daughter lost the before she died. The
doctors say it was a heart attack, but at the young age of 30? . I think
he had to much strain on his heart over the loss of our daughter. I began
to blame the house, it had took my only happiness from me. I moved out
shortly after, but rumors have it that the family's that lived there soon
after swore to see and man and little girl walking the house in search
of each other.. This is my true but sad story and someday we will be together
again. As for the house, it still stands and every so often I drive to
see if I can get a glimpse of my family it took from me....</B>
<BR><B>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</B>
<BR><B>And please, If you know someone that lives there now, Don't go in
the little dark room by the furnace!</B>
