<P><B>CAVALRY RETREAT!</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: randyb3@hotmail.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>My life has been relatively free of paranormal occurrences, although
one morning at age eight I experienced the much-dreaded "sleep paralysis."&nbsp;
There is, however, one other story worth mentioning.</B>
<BR><B>In 1991 I was a 20 year old Army corporal stationed in Germany.&nbsp;
By this time, I was a graduate of French Commando School and was in charge
of my own Cavalry recon squad (a jeep with two other guys).&nbsp; One chilly
winter night, my unit was deployed somewhere in southwestern Germany in
the wilderness during field exercises.&nbsp; We were literally in the middle
of nowhere.&nbsp; Anyway, me and my crew spent half the night slinking
through the woods doing the usual Cavalry style reconnaissance patrols.&nbsp;
At around 2 a.m. we were told to stop the jeep and set up a listening post
in a clump of trees.&nbsp; I decided to be the first "watch" of the night
while the other two guys got some sleep.&nbsp; After about thirty minutes
of staring into black nothingness, I decided to get up and walk around
a bit.&nbsp;&nbsp; With a weapon in hand and a radio on my back, I began
to prowl around the area.&nbsp; Yes it was unbelievably dark, but at least
this was keeping me occupied.&nbsp; Suddenly, a very average night turned
into an encounter I will never forget!</B>
<BR><B>After several minutes of walking, I suddenly realized how quiet
the night was.&nbsp; Not a sound to be heard from animal or insect!&nbsp;
Thinking this was a bit strange, I walked a few more paces before realizing
I was right in the middle of a very old deserted village!&nbsp; I pulled
out my night vision goggles and noticed that the "village" consisted of
about seven or eight old stone houses.&nbsp; Only the walls remained, as
the old thatched roofs were long gone.&nbsp; Suddenly I felt this dark,
EVIL presence like a weight on my shoulders!&nbsp; I knew I was being watched
by someone or something, and knew that I was NOT welcome in this place.&nbsp;
I slowly turned around and began walking back the way I came, with every
footstep in the tall dry grass sounding like a firecracker!&nbsp; It was
very slow and painful walking out of this place...&nbsp; I consider myself
a rational person, but was truly scared as I made the long walk back to
the jeep.&nbsp; Needless to say, I spent the rest of the night INSIDE the
jeep!</B>
<BR><B>As you read the stories on this site, it may be hard to appreciate
the feelings others have felt as they try to tell their tales.&nbsp; I
promise you, the fear and "sixth sense" we have felt during these tales
are the most important part of the story!</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Explanation?</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Irishiz4u@aol.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>hi my names brooke.. i work at a assisted living facility in pennsylvania..
i</B>
<BR><B>work the 11-7 shift so of course there are alot of stories about
the place</B>
<BR><B>already.. but besides that i was wondering if the experiences i
have had ..</B>
<BR><B>as insignificant as they may seem or be.. could be the activities
of ghosts..</B>
<BR><B>or just my mind.. of course i am not the only one that claims to
have seen</B>
<BR><B>things but who knows...for instance..</B>
<BR><B>I will be just walking around the building and i constantly think
that i see</B>
<BR><B>things. like out of the corner of my eye. its not a defiant thing
its just a</B>
<BR><B>shape.. its either black or white.. a lady i work with always sees
black when</B>
<BR><B>she sees the things out of the corner of her eye.. but i mostly
always see</B>
<BR><B>white.. the forms are white that is..is there a reason she sees
black and i</B>
<BR><B>see white.. and today for instance i was walking and i was sure
there was</B>
<BR><B>someone behind me..and when i semi turned around out of the corner
of my eye.</B>
<BR><B>i swore there was a figure there for a split second but it was gone
when i</B>
<BR><B>fully turned my head.. it scared me to death actually..that is why
i am</B>
<BR><B>writing to you because today that was the closest a form or figure
has ever</B>
<BR><B>been.. i guess you could say.. noone has ever died in this facility
that i</B>
<BR><B>work in.. but they have died in the hospital.. before all their
belongs were</B>
<BR><B>out of there rooms.. the building has only been open for 4 years
maybe 5.. i</B>
<BR><B>was just wondering if these could be ghosts or just my eyes playing
tricks on</B>
<BR><B>me.. lots of the residents say they see a women in white in there
room or</B>
<BR><B>sitting on there bed.. i dont know how to explain or take that either..</B><B></B>

<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>The house on Campbell Lane is&nbsp; haunted it dates back to civil
war days and</B>
<BR><B>the slaves were kept in the cellar. The house still looks old as
most of the</B>
<BR><B>orginal structure and walls are in place, even some old wallpaper.&nbsp;
It really</B>
<BR><B>needs updating. Over the years my relatives have hear various thumps
and</B>
<BR><B>footsteps.&nbsp; One time My aunt said she saw the car drive around
the house but</B>
<BR><B>they went outside it never looked like it moved.</B>
<BR><B>The weirdest</B>
<BR><B>; we were talking about my child custody case, and then the talk
started</B>
<BR><B>about the ghosts.&nbsp; Everyone looked up very weird and started
going to the</B>
<BR><B>front entrance, we were in the kitchen.&nbsp; The sound was a baby
crying.&nbsp; The</B>
<BR><B>only baby in the house was my baby and she was sound asleep in my
arms at the</B>
<BR><B>table where we were talking.</B>
<BR><B>Weird.&nbsp; I always wondered what that meant.&nbsp; The funny
thing is we are not</B>
<BR><B>scared of the house.&nbsp; It is a loved house and is full of happy
memories for</B>
<BR><B>us all as we have had many family gatherings for over 25+ years.&nbsp;
I even</B>
<BR><B>lived there every summer.</B>
<BR><B>{PS- I lost the custody case.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Old Farm House</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: saturns_edge@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>id like to know, if you could, what exactly is in and/or around the
farm where my grandparents,&nbsp; aunts, and my mom lived.</B>
<BR><B>The first little bit is sort of an animal, (we think), my uncle,
and my mother saw this,&nbsp; one night my mom, uncle, and a few other
people were there playing cards and a "hairy thing" went across the porch.&nbsp;
mom thought it was their dog, uncle didn't know what it was, so my granma
went out to investigate but never saw anything. so that's the first story
but this sorta ties into the footprint I saw one day, but the thing is
the "thing" was smaller, the footprint was just slightly big, it was only
one footprint though and it was like it stepped into a mud puddle but it
hadn't rained for quite some time. it was surrounded by grass.</B>
<BR><B>#2&nbsp; lets see, next would be that a ball would roll across the
floor by itself and bounce down the stairs, they never really saw this
roll but they could hear it rolling from the lower floor, then their dog
would go up to the stairs and wag his tail</B>
<BR><B>#3 okay, this may seem like its fake but truly its not, my oldest
aunt(I have two)&nbsp; was sleeping in her bed and it had a headboard on
it, well one night she woke up to see two "witch hands" going out from
the headboard and laying down on her pillow, the hands were hairy, and
had long fingernails</B>
<BR><B>well another thing goes into this, when my granparents still lived
there my oldest cousin was playing with a tablet of paper and it had a
drawing in it of a face to go (exactly) with the hands that my aunt saw</B>
<BR><B>#4 this is my middle aunt, one night she was sleeping and rolled
over on her side to see a face staring right at her of course she screamed
and the rest&nbsp; I don't know</B>
<BR><B>#5 most of this happened before my mom and some friends had a little
fun with a ouija board</B>
<BR><B>one night they were sitting down and working with it and asking
some questions, like "is there any1 there?" etc well anyway, at one time
they saw red eyes floating around the room, and outlines of figures</B>
<BR><B>#6 my mom didn't have the bad types of things as my aunts did, my
mom saw the nicer of the ghosts there, she had seen a lady that reminded
her a little of granma when she was in the house and thought she saw granma
walking around in her nightgown, when she was still actually in bed.</B>
<BR><B>Well that's in the old farm house, there's probably other stories
that I'm forgetting though, the reason for all the bad things that went
on in that house is probably because the last inhabitant was a very mean
person and by mean, I mean, MEAN.&nbsp; anyway I think the story of him
goes that he was caught in a blizzard at the house couldn't get anywhere
and the people to clear the snow couldn't get into him, so he ended up
dying because of the cold.</B>
<BR><B>As far as our house not much bad things has happened here, but just
a few things</B>
<BR><B>#1 the first one was my mom was getting ready for supper and for
a flash my mom turned around and saw a little white haired girl pinafore
dress on.</B>
<BR><B>#2this is short but I always see a cat or something streak across
the house at times.</B>
<BR><B>#3 one night when I was pretty little, mom was watching the news
and I was laying out infront of the TV.&nbsp; of course as being a little
kid I didn't want to watch the news. so I looked over and saw someone(who
I thought was mom) go into the kitchen.&nbsp; well I turned to go and get
the remote to change to cartoons and mom was sitting on the couch still
there giving me a "what are you think you are you doing?" look.</B>
<BR><B>#4 fourth and final, sorry it took so long, well this was right
when I got up one morning, I didn't have my glasses on but I thought I
saw a figure with a cap and nightdress on go across one side of my bed
then disappear</B><B></B>

<P><B>Compendium Of True Paranormal Stories:</B>
<BR><B>By carlosmeen1@prtc.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The subnames of these short
stories-which I baptized as such- were the black square, the roof banger,
the demolisher; the stinker,and the lost one. The locations for these stories
were in/at my house, roads and at work. The time spans for all these stories
were daily for a year. The purpose for these ghosts was to terrify me.
This contention was supported by my reasoning, which was based on my physical
resistance at them. The first ghost would appeared at the grazing land
for cattles in front of my house every time I backed up my car from my
garage. It simply flew across it and then, banished into the far end. The
second made appearances on my roof at night while I computerized on my
computer. Its bangs became so lauder that prompted ( bothered me ) me to
probe it. I obtained my latter and climbed onto it. Upon climbing it, I
had expected to find markings onto the surface of roof, which I&nbsp; did
not. Next into this probe, I asked my landlord about anything on the history
of my house I have should known when I moved in. His reply was I was hearing
things. The third one, the demolisher, scared me to death with his breaking
of glasses and plates at night. It stopped after taking a putdown from
me. The fourth followed me around my work area. It stuck like parch old
smell. This smell was similar to the one that is found after having opened
an storage device. I haven't mentioned it to my coworkers</B>
<BR><B>but I have noticed that either thing had happened when the this
ghost was around: People left or people murmured about this odor.</B>
<BR><B>The last one was always walking in the opposite direction I drove
toward. Its shape was a black contour of a human being. It would appeared
during day times.</B>

<P><B>THE CLARENDON AVENUE HAUNTING</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: jamfam@magma.ca</B><B></B>

<P><B>The story I'm about to tell you happened to me directly and has forever</B>
<BR><B>changed my view on the supernatural.&nbsp; I would like to state
for the</B>
<BR><B>record that I have always been a skeptical person who never believed
in</B>
<BR><B>anything that couldn't be proven.&nbsp; Before my experience I didn't
believe</B>
<BR><B>in ghosts and had never given the topic a second thought.&nbsp;
Since then it</B>
<BR><B>has been on my mind frequently.</B>
<BR><B>This is my story.</B>
<BR><B>The event in question occurred several years ago at my grandparents’</B>
<BR><B>house.&nbsp; I was 19.&nbsp; I had been out with my friends and
returned home</B>
<BR><B>around 2:00 am.&nbsp; I retired to my bedroom on the second floor
of the</B>
<BR><B>house and got into bed.&nbsp; I had been lying there for two or
three minutes</B>
<BR><B>reflecting on the events of the evening when suddenly I heard the</B>
<BR><B>muffled screaming of a woman coming from the basement.&nbsp; Almost</B>
<BR><B>immediately the screaming began to slowly ascend the stairs and
within a</B>
<BR><B>minute had reached the first floor.&nbsp; It continued to ascend
the stairs</B>
<BR><B>and thirty seconds later had reached the second floor and was right</B>
<BR><B>outside of my room.&nbsp; The screaming was very loud and was clearly
that of</B>
<BR><B>a woman.&nbsp; My bedroom door was closed and I could therefore
see nothing.</B>
<BR><B>The screaming continued outside of my room for approximately one
minute</B>
<BR><B>and then slowly began to descend the stairs into the basement just
as it</B>
<BR><B>had come.&nbsp; When it reached the basement the screaming ceased
and the</B>
<BR><B>house was silent.&nbsp; That is the end of my story.</B>
<BR><B>I feel that in order for me to give an objective account of this</B>
<BR><B>occurrence, it is important that I detail my own actions and opinions.</B>
<BR><B>When I first heard the noise I recognized that it was coming from
the</B>
<BR><B>basement, and although it sounded like a woman screaming I immediately</B>
<BR><B>disregarded this as being ridiculous.&nbsp; I started to try and
rationalize</B>
<BR><B>what I was hearing however my analysis ended rather abruptly when
I</B>
<BR><B>realized that the noise was getting closer.&nbsp; By the time it
reached the</B>
<BR><B>first floor it had become quite loud and being unable to think of
any</B>
<BR><B>rational explanation for such a noise, I became convinced that the
ghost</B>
<BR><B>of a woman was ascending the stairs of my grandparents house.&nbsp;
I became</B>
<BR><B>completely terrified and quickly sat up in bed, both so that I could</B>
<BR><B>hear better, and so that I could run, if necessary.&nbsp; When it
reached the</B>
<BR><B>second floor and was outside my room every hair on my body was standing</B>
<BR><B>on end and my hands were literally shaking with fear.&nbsp; I was
too scared</B>
<BR><B>to move and for that reason remained stationary until it returned
to the</B>
<BR><B>basement and the noise subsided.&nbsp; I stayed where I was for
several</B>
<BR><B>minutes waiting for the noise to return.&nbsp;&nbsp; When it didn't,
I got up,</B>
<BR><B>turned on my light, and sat back down on my bed.&nbsp; Being wide-awake
and</B>
<BR><B>in no mood to sleep, I spent the next couple of hours lying in my
bed</B>
<BR><B>listening and thinking about what had happened.&nbsp; Eventually
I fell</B>
<BR><B>asleep and the next morning when I woke up my light was still on
and I</B>
<BR><B>was completely convinced that I had heard a ghost.&nbsp; I spent
the entire</B>
<BR><B>day gathering information and trying to figure out what I had heard.</B>
<BR><B>The only other people in the house were my grandparents.&nbsp; My
grandmother</B>
<BR><B>is a sound sleeper and my grandfather is hard of hearing.&nbsp;&nbsp;
They heard</B>
<BR><B>nothing.&nbsp; They bought the house in 1966 and sold it in 2000.&nbsp;&nbsp;
During</B>
<BR><B>that time they never heard anything that even remotely resembles
what I</B>
<BR><B>described.&nbsp; My mother lived in the house for several years
in her late</B>
<BR><B>teens and never heard anything either.&nbsp; I myself lived in the
house on</B>
<BR><B>and off for years and had never heard anything before and have not
heard</B>
<BR><B>anything since.</B>
<BR><B>I considered that maybe the pipes or something else in the house
made</B>
<BR><B>the noise, although I don't think any pipe on earth could have made
the</B>
<BR><B>noise I heard.&nbsp; I dismissed this theory any ways because if
the house</B>
<BR><B>did make odd noises someone would have heard them in the past thirty</B>
<BR><B>years.&nbsp; I also dismissed the wind because I have spent many
windy nights</B>
<BR><B>in the house and heard nothing.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the end I came to
the conclusion</B>
<BR><B>that there was no earthly explanation for what I heard and that
what I</B>
<BR><B>experienced must have been supernatural.&nbsp; It sounds crazy saying
that</B>
<BR><B>but I know what I heard, I will never forget it.&nbsp; I'm sure
it was a</B>
<BR><B>ghost.</B>
<BR><B>In conclusion I would just like to state that all of my friends
think I</B>
<BR><B>was asleep and that the whole thing was a dream.&nbsp; I would like
to touch</B>
<BR><B>on this briefly.&nbsp; The first thing I would like to say is that
I know I</B>
<BR><B>was not asleep.</B>
<BR><B>Here's my case.</B>
<BR><B>I had only been in bed for two or three minutes (less than five
for</B>
<BR><B>sure) and was lying on my back thinking.&nbsp; I have always had
a difficult</B>
<BR><B>time falling asleep, it usually takes me twenty or thirty minutes,
and I</B>
<BR><B>have never been able to sleep on my back.&nbsp; At the time I was
making no</B>
<BR><B>attempt to sleep, but was lying there thinking.&nbsp; Secondly,
no matter how</B>
<BR><B>real a dream seems you always wake up afterwards and that's how
you know</B>
<BR><B>you were dreaming.&nbsp; I don't think it's possible to remember
a dream</B>
<BR><B>without waking up and realizing you were dreaming.&nbsp; If it is,
it's never</B>
<BR><B>happened to me.&nbsp; If it had been a dream I would have woke up
and said</B>
<BR><B>“wow, that was one weird dream”.&nbsp;&nbsp; That never happened.&nbsp;
I was awake.</B>
<BR><B>Thirdly I turned the light on after the occurrence and it was still
on</B>
<BR><B>when I woke up in the morning.&nbsp; I know for a fact that I was
awake.</B>
<BR><B>That is my story and I swear to you that every word of it is the
truth.</B>
<BR><B>I don't know if you will believe me, no one else does, but I swear
it's</B>
<BR><B>the truth.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hi-I had this experience when I was 7.&nbsp; My mom had married after
the death of my father and my step dad's wife, Bea. We moved into his house,
in which Bea had died of natural causes. I was asleep in my room and I
woke from a sound sleep because I heard my name being called. Our dog was
asleep on the bed but no one else was there. I sat up and looked out the
window into the dark and saw a woman's face. I never told anyone until
years later when I knew I'd be taken more seriously. I had seen a picture
of Bea after my step dad had died and it was Bea's face I had seen. I'm
sure she wasn't happy with my mom and I being moved into her house.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>7 Years Of Haunts</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: dixiechicks84@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I am 17 years old. in the past 7 years i have lived in 3 different
houses and every one of them had a ghost. The first one we lived in from
'94 - ' 96. The occurance the spooked me there happend in my parents room.
a week before anything weird happend a bunch of knickknacks fell off of
my mom's headboard. So, she just put it back and pushed it away from the
edge. On easter morning of&nbsp; '95 I was with my brother, sister and
dad watching tv in the living room, about 20 feet away from my parents
bedroom door. I heard a bang and my mom came running out of her room wanting
to know who was pounding. Apparently when I heard the bang all the stuff
that had fallen off of her headboard kinda flew off this time. Not only
that but this oreo cookie tin can she had looked like it had been stepped
on. After that our next door neighbor told us that she had seen the old
man that lived there before us in the backyard on the day he died in the
hospital. Now the living room looked into a hallway. In the hallway you
could see into my brothers room and my parents room was right next door.
The living room had a clear view of my parents room. One night my dad fell
asleep in the living room. he was sleeping&nbsp; facing the hallway. He
suddenly woke up and looked into his room. He saw this cloud of smoke billowing
in the hallway moving towards his room. He jumped up and yelled fire. When
he yelled my brother woke up and saw this. The cloud settled in the hallway
and disappeared. I know this was not any kind of imagination because my
brother and my dad are very logical and analytical people and they both
witnessed this. In the next house it was never anything really. The only
occurance that happend was the night one of our cats died. The cat house
was in the corner of my room and i had a nightlight next to the cat house.
I looked up to the top of the cat house and I saw the shadow of our dead
cat. The cat loved sleeping on the top every night and this night was no
exception. The third house is the house we have lived in for the last 3
years. I believe it all started with the woman. My dad wakes up early in
the morning to get ready for work. When this happend my mom would occaisionally
fall asleep in the living room. There is a door next to the entryway that
leads into the back hallway where all the rooms are. The first room is
my brothers, the second is my parents, then you turn and then comes my
sisters room and lastly mine. Now on this morning my dad woke up and looked
over. He saw the back of the woman and assumed it was my mom. He got up
and went out into the living room and saw my mom sleeping on the couch.
he went back to his room and no one was there. After that I had an experience
with a man. It was about 4 in the morning and I was suddenly woken up by
the feeling of a large man tapping my foot. I looked up and no one was
there. I have this tigger stuffed animal that i got for my birthday from
my sister. At the time of my next story my large dog slept in my room with
me. He would sleep up against the door so i couldn't sleepwalk and open
it without waking up. I woke up one morning and my tigger was no where
so i figured it rolled under the bed. I opened my door and it was laying
outside of my door. About a year ago my mom started sleeping out in the
living room for health reasons. The wall the our couch leans against is
connected to my brothers room. We had a family friend staying in there
while my brother was in boot camp. one morning my mom woke up about 7 am.
She heard a knocking on the wall between the living room and my brothers
room. she thought it was just outr friend when it moved to the wall behind
our computer about 10 feet away.This is an inside wall and there is no
way there could be knocking. it then moved to the ceiling. she said it
sounded like someone knocking. a couple nights later I heard a banging
in my parents bathroom. Their bathroom is across the hall from my brothers
room. my bathroom is across from my sisters room and the bathtub stalls
are back to back. When i heard the banging it sounded like it was coming
from the wall where the shower head is and they have alot of shelves over
there so it would be impossible to bang as clearly as i heard. a couple
hours later i heard shuffling footsteps in the hall coming from the bathroom.
On 2 occaisions my dad has seen a streaking white figure that appears to
be a cat but we are not positive. We have also seen shadow people walking
on the side yard through our shutters. Not long ago, our next door neighbor
told us that the houses in our neighborhood was built on Indian burial
ground. We are not sure if this has anything to do with all this. The house
we live in now appears to be the most haunted so far. next time i will
tell you my dads ghost stories.</B>

<BR><B>THE FOOTSTEPS ON THE STAIRS</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: LUSHS0502@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>I'm 17 years old and I use to live in an old house, made in 1921,
in Haverhill, Massachusetts that I know is haunted.</B>
<BR><B>One day when I was 10 I was in my upstairs bedroom with my two sisters
coloring, I think that's when it started. We were home alone when we heard
the closet that's right at the end of the stairs, slide open then we heard
it slide back. The sliding doors of the closet always made a loud rumbling
noise when it was opened. When we heard it that day we didn't get scared
at first because we thought my Mom had gotten home from work, so we ran
downstairs to greet her to find that nobody was home. We looked around
and then looked outside to see if the car was in the drive way but we were
alone...or so we thought. We ran back upstairs to our room and grabbed
shoes and hangers for so-called protection. Then all of a sudden we heard
footsteps racing up the stairs, then back down. We never saw anything actually
reach the top of the stairs but they ran up and down repeatedly about ten
times then it&nbsp; stopped. We were so scared we just sat there crying
waiting to hear more, but nothing else happened.</B>
<BR><B>Then when I was 15, I was taking care of a dog and when I brought
it to the foot of the stairs he froze and just stared at the top. I didn't
think much about it, so I picked him up and brought him up the stairs to
my room and closed the door. The dog then began crying and he seemed to
be getting nervous and uneasy and he started scratching at the door. When
I opened the door to let him out he ran down the steps so fast that by
the time I got out the door he was gone.</B>
<BR><B>After that many more things started to happen. I awoke one morning
to hear something or someone dragging themselves on the rug next to my
bed I was so frozen with fear that I didn't look to see what it was.</B>
<BR><B>The cabinets in our kitchen would open and slam shut by themselves.
I could also hear the silverware jiggling and slamming inside the drawers.
The computer keyboard would also type by itself. I have also had my foot
slapped and have felt something sit on me while I was laying in my bed.</B>
<BR><B>There are too many noises and weird things to explain. And also
creepy dreams. So I'm glad to be out of that house. But I would like to
know if that house has some kind of history or if anybody died there.</B>
<BR><B>Last year after we moved out of that house, our cousins were sleeping
over and we were talking about our old house. One of my cousins who slept
over our house a lot asked why our dad always walked up to our room and
why he did it over and over without ever coming in our room. We told her
about the day we heard the racing footsteps running up the stairs and she
got so freaked out. My other cousin also said she hated sleeping in our
room because she always heard those same footsteps, coming up the stairs
but never making to the top before it ran back down again.</B>
<BR><B>Now in our present house in Orlando, FL., weird things have suddenly
begun to happen. Noises, shadowy figures and also short wide figures have
appeared. I always seem to see something with the corner of my eye but
when I turn my head to look there is nothing there. And my sister felt
somebody whistle and blow in her ear.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>hello, my name is nikki, and im 14 years old. unfortunately, i dont
remember the details to my story very well, because it happened when i
was about 4 or 5 years old. but anyway, my family lived in a large house
that was actually quite old. one night, i was asleep in my bedroom upstairs,
and i awoke in the middle of the night. i went straight across the hall
to my brother's room and asked him to come downstairs with me because i
was scared and wanted to sleep with mom and dad. he asked me why i was
scared and i said i didnt know. so he came down with me. we started down
the stairs, and i froze at the sight that i saw. there was a little boy
at the end of the stairs. now, this could have been my younger brother,
but my brother was just a few months old. this little boy had brown hair,
and was just sitting at the bottom of the stairs. i wasnt scared, so we
kept walking. we got into my parent's room, and i was getting ready to
climb in their bed, and all the lights in the house came on at once.&nbsp;
my dad woke up, and checked the circuit breaker, but nothing was wrong,
so he went through the house and shut all the lights back off. well, the
next night, i saw the same little boy, and the same thing happened again.
this activity continued for a few more days, and my parents checked out
some information by the guy that lived there before. he said a little boy
around the age of 5 died because he was very sick. he died in the middle
of the night, in his sleep, and a few hours before he went to sleep, he
turned all the ;ights in the house on, because he was afraid of the dark.
the night that i started seeing the little boy, was the night that i was
afraid of the dark. i have never "seen" anything since, even though i have
moved several times.i always somehow sence when there is an unknown presence
around, though.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but i will always remember that night.
i have since been afraid of the dark. though i hate to admit it, but its
not like anyone is gonna criticize me for it.</B>

<P><B>my roomate went on the walking tour with ghost tours of saint augustine
in saint augustine, florida and took this picture. it was taken in the
tolomato cemetary. the shadowy little boy is seen in the right hand corner
directly on the tree. the tour guide told a story of how a girl scout troop
on the tour saw him in the tree (the one in the photo) watching the tour
and later on the ground trying to reach out to the tour guide as if to
hug him. the girls were crying and very shook up about it. my roomate said
she was "talking" in her mind to him, telling him hello, just before she
took this picture. the people at ghost tours of saint augustine said that
there is a small headstone next to the tree that indicates that "james"
was five years old when he died. the cemetary is a catholic sacred area
and they are investigating the story of james. we plan to go back to the
cemetary soon and take more photos and maybe try to communicate with him.
i love your site and visit it all the time. we will send more ghostly pictures
as we get them.</B>

<P><B>&nbsp; La Llorona</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: shoohali2000@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Some of you may have heard the story or legend of "La</B>
<BR><B>Llorona" or the wailing woman that haunts bodies of</B>
<BR><B>water because she drowned her children afer being</B>
<BR><B>spurned by her lover. The legend is that she was a</B>
<BR><B>Mestizo or Indian woman who fell in love with a</B>
<BR><B>Spaniard who was royalty. They had children throughout</B>
<BR><B>thier affair, which was kept secret because she was a</B>
<BR><B>poor Indian and he was Spanish royalty. He then</B>
<BR><B>decided to marry a Spanish woman and spurned the</B>
<BR><B>Indian woman. The Indian woman, distraut, drowned her</B>
<BR><B>children at the local river. She may have been</B>
<BR><B>executed for her crime. This was supposed to have</B>
<BR><B>happened somewhere in the American Southwest or Mexico</B>
<BR><B>before the turn of the century. Throughout the years</B>
<BR><B>reports of a baby crying followed by a splash of water</B>
<BR><B>or a wailing woman could be heard by bodies of water,</B>
<BR><B>such as lakes and rivers. In the Hispanic culture many</B>
<BR><B>children who don't behave are told that La Llorona is</B>
<BR><B>going to pay them a visit if they don't act right.</B>
<BR><B>Except for some slight inconsistencies, that's how the</B>
<BR><B>legend goes.</B>
<BR><B>Now my story...I live in San Antonio, TX. My mother is</B>
<BR><B>a firm believer in ghosts and recently told my sister</B>
<BR><B>and I that she heard who she believes was La Llorona</B>
<BR><B>in front of our house! She stated that on two</B>
<BR><B>occassions she was awake around 1 or 2 am as she could</B>
<BR><B>not sleep. The first time she was in the living room</B>
<BR><B>of our house which faces the main street in our area.</B>
<BR><B>She stated she heard some dogs barking in the distance</B>
<BR><B>and it seemed that they were barking at something that</B>
<BR><B>was coming down the street, as the dogs nearby also</B>
<BR><B>joined in on the ruckus. My mom said that she then</B>
<BR><B>heard a woman wailing and it sounded as if the wailing</B>
<BR><B>was coming from the street. She said that the wailing</B>
<BR><B>sounded as if a woman was in deep sorrow, but loud</B>
<BR><B>wailing. She said the wailing then trailed off into</B>
<BR><B>the distance, as did the barking from the neighborhood</B>
<BR><B>dogs, as if someone or something walked down the</B>
<BR><B>street. My mom said she got goosebumps and returned to</B>
<BR><B>her bedroom. My mom said that this same thing happend</B>
<BR><B>on another occassion. She told my sister and I and we</B>
<BR><B>laughed it off. We are now in our 30's and I don't</B>
<BR><B>live at home anymore. Well, recently my sister heard</B>
<BR><B>the wailing from the back bedroom one night. She said</B>
<BR><B>that it came from the street and sounded as if it was</B>
<BR><B>going down the street, dogs barking and all. My sister</B>
<BR><B>said it sounded loud and the wailing sounded very sad,</B>
<BR><B>as if a woman wailing for someone that died. I am not</B>
<BR><B>sure if this was La Llorona, but what else could it</B>
<BR><B>have been? If anyone has any similiar stories to</B>
<BR><B>share, feel free to e-mail me. Thanks!</B>

<BR><B>A History of 2 Families</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: LPaszkiewicz@moheck.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>I will start by saying that I am 22 and live in the Kansas City MO
area.&nbsp; My</B>
<BR><B>family and my husband's family have had many unusual experiences
that they</B>
<BR><B>have shared with me.&nbsp; Also, about a year &amp; 1/2 ago I had
my own experience</B>
<BR><B>which made me become less of a skeptic.&nbsp; Sorry, this is so
long but I feel</B>
<BR><B>the need to share this collection of experiences.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;The first story I recall happened to my mom's sister.&nbsp;
She and her</B>
<BR><B>husband were asleep in their bedroom and were the only ones there.&nbsp;
Their 2</B>
<BR><B>sons had moved out several years before.&nbsp; My aunt was woken
up at about 1 or</B>
<BR><B>2 am when she heard footsteps on the stairs leading up to their
bedroom.</B>
<BR><B>She thought maybe it was one of the boys stopping by for something
so she</B>
<BR><B>called out their names.&nbsp; No response.&nbsp; She continued to
hear the creaking of</B>
<BR><B>the steps &amp; breathing like someone was there.&nbsp; She called
their names again,</B>
<BR><B>but still no answer.&nbsp; She became very freightened at the thought
that maybe</B>
<BR><B>it was an intruder that had broken in so she woke her husband up
to check it</B>
<BR><B>out.&nbsp; As she did this she heard the footsteps go back down
the stairs.&nbsp; They</B>
<BR><B>were both wide awake by then and got up to check the house out.&nbsp;
They turned</B>
<BR><B>all the lights on and checked every room, door and window, but found
nothing</B>
<BR><B>and haven't been able to find an explanation for the footsteps and
breathing</B>
<BR><B>heard on the hallway stairs.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;The second story was one I overheard my mom telling my aunt
and</B>
<BR><B>grandma.&nbsp; At the time my mom &amp; I were living in the house
next to my</B>
<BR><B>grandma.&nbsp; I was about 9 or 10 yrs old when this happened.&nbsp;
My mom had told</B>
<BR><B>them that the night before, something really strange had happened
to her</B>
<BR><B>while she was in bed, just before falling asleep.&nbsp; She was
lying there in</B>
<BR><B>bed when she heard a dog growling so she rolled over and looked
down beside</B>
<BR><B>her bed (thinking maybe it was one of our dogs) but only to see
a dog/demon</B>
<BR><B>creature standing beside her bed growling at her with large bared
teeth and</B>
<BR><B>red eyes.&nbsp; She immediately started praying for it to leave
but it didn't</B>
<BR><B>leave, it just stopped growling and layed down next to her bed &amp;
went to</B>
<BR><B>sleep.&nbsp; At this point she no longer felt threatened and went
to sleep</B>
<BR><B>herself.&nbsp; It was gone when she woke in the morning.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;Then, while we were still living in that house, on another</B>
<BR><B>particular night my mom remembers waking up (whether she was dreaming
or not</B>
<BR><B>she can't recall, but it seemed very real to her so she's not sure)
and</B>
<BR><B>looking out her bedroom door into the hallway.&nbsp; She said I
was standing</B>
<BR><B>there in the hallway looking at her and standing next to me was
an angelic</B>
<BR><B>ghostly mirror image of myself.&nbsp; She thinks that it was God
showing her my</B>
<BR><B>guardian angel.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;And, then came the story my grandma had to tell that occured
not</B>
<BR><B>long after my aunt's and my mom's experiences.&nbsp; She was in
bed sleeping one</B>
<BR><B>night when she heard something moving &amp; woke up.&nbsp; She listened
carefully and</B>
<BR><B>heard the panting and footsteps of a dog with it's nails tapping
on the</B>
<BR><B>hardwood floors.&nbsp; It was pacing from her room to the guest
bedroom and up</B>
<BR><B>and down the hall.&nbsp; She sat up in bed to see where her dog
was, thinking</B>
<BR><B>maybe he had heard a noise &amp; got up to check it out but when
she looked he</B>
<BR><B>was next to her bed, ears perked, also intentely listening.&nbsp;
My grandma</B>
<BR><B>continued to hear the noise for about 15 minutes after that &amp;
then her dog</B>
<BR><B>left the bedroom as if he were following the sound to investigate
and that</B>
<BR><B>is when it stopped.&nbsp; Noone knows what it was for sure but it
could have</B>
<BR><B>possibly been a former dog that had died a few years before.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;Several years later I met my husband.&nbsp; His parents' house
is a whole</B>
<BR><B>other continuing saga of sightings, voices and noises.&nbsp; There
are more</B>
<BR><B>stories than I can tell about here so I will summarize.&nbsp; The
house was</B>
<BR><B>originally built about 50 yrs ago by a man who intended for his
family when</B>
<BR><B>it was done.&nbsp; However, as the house was about 3/4 finished
it was severely</B>
<BR><B>vandalized one night and for some reason he abandoned his project
and sold</B>
<BR><B>the house.&nbsp; That is when it came into my husband's family and
has stayed in</B>
<BR><B>the family since.&nbsp; My husband's grandparents bought the house
and the</B>
<BR><B>grandfather died in the master bathroom of a heart attack while
taking a</B>
<BR><B>shower.&nbsp; The grandmother died in the master bedroom.&nbsp;
After their deaths</B>
<BR><B>another daughter and her husband lived there with their children.&nbsp;
They</B>
<BR><B>eventually moved and sold it to my husbands parents.&nbsp; My husband
is one of</B>
<BR><B>10 children and his mother also had 5 miscarriages.&nbsp; He is
the 8th child and</B>
<BR><B>they moved there when he was 11 mos old.&nbsp; Everyone that has
lived there or</B>
<BR><B>even just visited the house can tell of strange things happening
or seeing</B>
<BR><B>things.&nbsp; Most have several stories.&nbsp; One of my husband's
youngest sisters</B>
<BR><B>saw grandma every morning while she was getting ready for school.&nbsp;
She would</B>
<BR><B>be drying her hair or doing her makeup and she would see something
out of</B>
<BR><B>the corner of her eye and she would see her grandmother (who died
before she</B>
<BR><B>was born) peering around the doorway watching her, then she would
walk off</B>
<BR><B>down the hall or vanish shortly upon being noticed.&nbsp; This happened
every</B>
<BR><B>morning and was never threatening, however it was pretty creepy.&nbsp;
Then, this</B>
<BR><B>same sister also would see shadows frequently in the bathroom while
she was</B>
<BR><B>taking her shower, walking back &amp; forth past the shower door.&nbsp;
Possibly her</B>
<BR><B>grandfather who died there.&nbsp; But, there are other strange things
that can't</B>
<BR><B>be explained and as far as the family knows, nobody else had died
there.</B>
<BR><B>There, was once a voice of a young girl coming from the end of the
hall near</B>
<BR><B>the bedrooms, calling, "Mom...mom, come here."&nbsp; My parents-in-law
and</B>
<BR><B>brother-in-law &amp; his wife were in the kitchen playing cards
when they heard</B>
<BR><B>this.&nbsp; My brother-in-law said, "Mom, one of the girls (younger
sisters) is</B>
<BR><B>calling you."&nbsp; And she said, "The girls aren't here, they're
out with</B>
<BR><B>friends.&nbsp; It's just us here."&nbsp; Who could the voice of
the girl belong to?</B>
<BR><B>They don't know.&nbsp; Also, in one of the kids' bedrooms, whichever
kid stayed</B>
<BR><B>in there over the years reported of terrible recuring nightmares
and then</B>
<BR><B>waking up under the bed or hanging onto the bedroom doorknob.&nbsp;
This happened</B>
<BR><B>to my husband and one of his older sisters when it was her room.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;And, until 2 years ago I had been skeptical but never the
less still</B>
<BR><B>creeped out whenever I was alone in the house.&nbsp; Then, one evening
I was</B>
<BR><B>coming from the kitchen and starting down the long hall to the bedroom
at</B>
<BR><B>the end where my husband was watching tv.&nbsp; As I turned the
corner into the</B>
<BR><B>hallway I saw a shadowy figure in the hall watching into my husband's
room</B>
<BR><B>and it turned and looked at me and immediately darted into another
bedroom.</B>
<BR><B>At first I thought it must have been his mother because it was about
the</B>
<BR><B>same height so I walked past the door where it had gone into &amp;
continued</B>
<BR><B>down the hall, noticing that the door was closed and that the figure
had</B>
<BR><B>simply went into the room without opening or closing the door.&nbsp;
I asked my</B>
<BR><B>husband (then, fiancee) if his mom had just been in the hall &amp;
he said that</B>
<BR><B>she hadn't.&nbsp; About 15 minutes later she came up from the basement
and said</B>
<BR><B>she had been down there for about 45 minutes doing laundry.&nbsp;
So I asked if</B>
<BR><B>it was him and he said he had been in the bedroom watching tv the
whole</B>
<BR><B>time.&nbsp; So I thought maybe it was his dad but then I found him
on the other</B>
<BR><B>side of the house in the family room.&nbsp; It was just us 4 there
in the house</B>
<BR><B>that evening and whatever it was I saw standing in the hall didn't
want to</B>
<BR><B>be seen.&nbsp; Whether the fact that he was a dark figure has anything
to do with</B>
<BR><B>who he is, I don't know.&nbsp; But upon re-telling what I had seen
to several</B>
<BR><B>other family members, one of my husband's brothers remarked that
he had also</B>
<BR><B>seen the same shadowy figure once before when he was younger &amp;
still living</B>
<BR><B>there.&nbsp; There are always sounds of footsteps and things falling
and crashing</B>
<BR><B>and the house seems to be filled with many spirits but only 2 can
be</B>
<BR><B>identified.&nbsp; There is also another story of a younger man seen
sitting in</B>
<BR><B>one of the chairs in the living room late at night rocking back
&amp; forth &amp;</B>
<BR><B>then vanishing when approached.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;My husband &amp; I are approaching our first anniversary and
will be</B>
<BR><B>going to the Crescent Hotel in Eureka Springs, AR.&nbsp; We are
staying in room</B>

<BR><B>Haunted House</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: jenniferk19@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I live in a house that is haunted by four ghosts.&nbsp; We moved
here when I was</B>
<BR><B>about eight yrs old so its been about twelve years since we moved
in.&nbsp; The</B>
<BR><B>house is small, it is one story, three bedromms two baths, a kitchen,
living</B>
<BR><B>room, and a backroom that was originally a garage.&nbsp; I remeber
my very first</B>
<BR><B>experiance, it was not too long after we moved in.&nbsp; I was eight
and my</B>
<BR><B>brother was nine.&nbsp; We stayed home alone in the afternoons after
school until</B>
<BR><B>my mother came home from work.&nbsp; My brother and I were watching
Disney</B>
<BR><B>Afternoon like we did everyday and I had just finished maiking mashed</B>
<BR><B>potatoes in the microwave, being forgetful as I am I forgot to put
the</B>
<BR><B>butter away.&nbsp; I had left the butter on the counter with the
butter knife</B>
<BR><B>sticking in it.&nbsp; While in the living room watching tv, my brother
and I</B>
<BR><B>heard a sound like something hitting the microwave and falling to
the floor</B>
<BR><B>so we went to check it out to see if something had fallen.&nbsp;
When we got to</B>
<BR><B>the kitchen the only thing on the floor was the butter knife.&nbsp;
It could not</B>
<BR><B>have fallen and landed in front of the microwave as it is on the
other side</B>
<BR><B>of the room, so it is much too far to fall.&nbsp; So we just laughed
it off and</B>
<BR><B>jokingly said it was a ghost.&nbsp; Later things were happening
more frequently</B>
<BR><B>to where we no longer joked about it being a ghost.&nbsp; The lights
would turn</B>
<BR><B>on or off in rooms, like someone was entering or leaving it.&nbsp;
The tv would</B>
<BR><B>turn up and down, change channels or turn off and on, an dmy radio
would</B>
<BR><B>turn up every night to the point where even to this day I won't
sleep with</B>
<BR><B>my radio on.&nbsp; One of the scariest events took place when I
was about 12.&nbsp; My</B>
<BR><B>door has a habit of opening on its own all the time.&nbsp; It was
happening</B>
<BR><B>almost every morning.&nbsp; I thought it was my brother trying to
be annoying</B>
<BR><B>because it would happen in the morning when I was getting ready
for school.</B>
<BR><B>Well one morning it happend and instead of just getting up and closing
it as</B>
<BR><B>I did any other time, I yelled at who I thought was my brother to
close my</B>
<BR><B>door.&nbsp; Well to my surprise the door did close, but I didn't
see anybody</B>
<BR><B>close it.&nbsp; So I got up to catch whoever it was in the hall,
but noone was</B>
<BR><B>out there.&nbsp; So I went into my brothers room to see if he shut
my door and he</B>
<BR><B>was asleep.&nbsp; So Who shut my door?&nbsp; Soon after my brother
had seen the ghost</B>
<BR><B>of a child in his room when he was about 14.&nbsp; He was scared
so badly that he</B>
<BR><B>ran to my parents room crying and would not go back to sleep in
there for a</B>
<BR><B>while.&nbsp; It was very unusual for him to cry at this age, he
was a tough kid,</B>
<BR><B>so I believed him when he told me what happened because you could
still see</B>
<BR><B>the fear on his face.&nbsp; I am the only one lucky enough to not
have seen them</B>
<BR><B>yet.&nbsp; I do know when they are around though.&nbsp; I get a
feeling that is sort</B>
<BR><B>of like knowing someone is in the room with you, but you can't see
them.&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>know that the girl who I call Katherine stays in my room alot and
George the</B>
<BR><B>Male ghost stays in the backroom and the hall way.&nbsp; This is
getting to long</B>
<BR><B>so I will tell my stories another time about the rest.&nbsp; Much
more has</B>
<BR><B>happened.</B>

<P><B>My Haunted House</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: dpmns@dundee.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>My wife and I purchased a house in Ypsilanti, Mi back in 1983. It
was an old home and after doing a lot of research we found out that it
was part of the underground railroad. Many strange things happened in that
house, but only to me for the most part. There was an apartment in the
rear main floor and the rest of the house we lived in. I worked midnights
at my job and came home one morning to go to sleep. I was in our kitchen
in the front of the house and then went upstairs to the back of the house.
Realizing I left something downstairs, I went back down and went by the
kitchen, and the water was running. No one else was home!&nbsp; It was
really weird but it didn't bother me until I went back upstairs and went
into the bathroom and the water was on in there also! I hadn't even been
in the bathroom upstairs. I was freaked. Anyway, one time I was walking
up the front stairway, and very clearly I heard a woman's voice say "hello...Hello"
I ran back downstairs and out the front door and looked all around the
house and I saw no one!&nbsp; During the time we owned the house, we had
to excavate the sewer drain to the street to repair it. The company we
hired started digging in the wrong direction and discovered an underground
room in the yard! it looked like a brick igloo and someone explained it
off as a septic tank, but the mortar on the inside of the "room" was bright
white and I felt that it would have been stained if it were a septic. Anyway,
we talked to the local historian, and he said that it was probably a holding
room for slaves!&nbsp; We also found a footmarker from a grave in the backyard
that had the initials "C.A.H."&nbsp; on it. We tried to find out if anyone
lived in the house with those initials but we couldn't find anyone. Most
of our friends and family later told us (after we moved out), that they
really felt uncomfortable in the house like someone was watching them!&nbsp;
The last really big thing that happened one night at about 2;30 in the
morning.&nbsp; Everyone in the house was awakened by a very loud explosion
that rattled the whole house. Our tenant in the apt. called us on the phone
to find out if we heard it and we were really scared, thinking that something
in the basement had blew up. I got some clothes on and went to the basement,
and found................................absolutely nothing wrong! I went
outside , looked around , checked the whole house over and couldn't find
anything or any explanation for the noise. The next day, I went up and
down the street knocking on neighbors doors and asking if anyone heard
the explosion.&nbsp; No one heard a thing and to this day we have no explanation
as to the origin of the sound! I even called the National weather Service
office at the local airport to see if there were any storms during the
night but they said no. Anyway, that's my haunted house story, so enjoy!</B>

<P><B>Hello.</B>
<BR><B>I have been in this house since 1983.</B>
<BR><B>Actually its a townhouse^_^;;</B>
<BR><B>I have a few ghosts in my house.</B>
<BR><B>All of them don't do any harm.</B>
<BR><B>For that part,I am grateful.</B>
<BR><B>They are playful and do not cause trouble.</B>
<BR><B>One ghost used to shake my bed,but when I called the name of Jesus,it</B>
<BR><B>stopped right away and has not happened ever since.</B>
<BR><B>Let me tell you about the ghost I know for sure.#1-the whistler-gender</B>
<BR><B>unknown.</B>
<BR><B>I have heard this ghost a couple of times.</B>
<BR><B>Seems to want my attention.That ghost has my attention alright.</B>
<BR><B>The best way to explain this whistle would</B>
<BR><B>be similar to the one heard in first Galaxy Express movie by the
main</B>
<BR><B>character Tetsuo/Joey. I hear this whistle occasionally like after</B>
<BR><B>7pm~3am.</B>
<BR><B>#2-whispy voice female-only heard in my mom's room.One day I went
to</B>
<BR><B>wake my mom up like 5:20am. I hear this whispy</B>
<BR><B>"hi" I thought it was my mom,but it was not her voice.</B>
<BR><B>#3-unknown-probably male-I was asleep</B>
<BR><B>then awoke suddenly to hear someone say the 4 letter "f" word.It
was the</B>
<BR><B>only time I ever heard this voice.</B>
<BR><B>#4-male-only heard once.My sister was staying over our pad.Again,I
had</B>
<BR><B>to wake my mom at 5:20am.I knock on the bedroom door and I hear
this</B>
<BR><B>friendly-handsome voice saying"hi".</B>
<BR><B>I really wonder if this ghost likes to travel with my sis?!?</B>
<BR><B>***********************************************</B>
<BR><B>Aside from the one that I have listed,I have one story I want to
share</B>
<BR><B>and you could tell me what the heck it is.</B>
<BR><B>Some years ago,I had a different bedroom.My bedroom was on the 2nd</B>
<BR><B>floor.I know the house creeks so I always</B>
<BR><B>had my light on.I was in a deep sleep then</B>
<BR><B>for no reason,I woke up right away.</B>
<BR><B>It was about 3am.There was no ap'arition.</B>
<BR><B>I heard this cold male voice sounding cartoonishly evil trying to</B>
<BR><B>pronounce my name. I was shocked and speechless.</B>
<BR><B>I did not go back to sleep.This was the only time I ever heard that</B>
<BR><B>voice.</B>

<P><B>Now a Believer</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: STibbetts@broadband.att.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I have a story that turned my ex husband into a believer of the spiritual</B>
<BR><B>realm.&nbsp; Last June we had a pretty heated argument, the next
night we had</B>
<BR><B>some strange things happening.&nbsp; It was 1:48 am and my youngest
son who was</B>
<BR><B>21 months old had woke us you crying.&nbsp; I laid in bed listening
hiding under</B>
<BR><B>the covers because I could feel the presence of something there.&nbsp;
My husband</B>
<BR><B>had gotten up and was very disoriented.&nbsp; He had found my 21
month old going</B>
<BR><B>down the stairs in the pitch black.&nbsp; He had tried to run from
his father.</B>
<BR><B>Brandon had pick him up, put him in his crib and came back to bed.&nbsp;
I was</B>
<BR><B>under the covers, eyes wide open, not saying a word.&nbsp; I knew
there was more.</B>
<BR><B>Then at 2:00 am we had heard my son again, this time, his cry was
muffled</B>
<BR><B>and so Brandon had gotten up again, this time turning the light
on, when the</B>
<BR><B>light was on, it was as if he was in a cave and there was only a
lantern to</B>
<BR><B>light up our hallway.&nbsp;&nbsp; He had found our son downstairs
in the kitchen</B>
<BR><B>screaming for him as if he had been forced down there.&nbsp; His
father picked</B>
<BR><B>him up put him in his crib again, but this time putting the gate
up.&nbsp; At</B>
<BR><B>2:10am we had heard the gate moving, this time, my son was in his
crib</B>
<BR><B>asleep, but the gate was shaking, so instead of investigating even
more, my</B>
<BR><B>husband laid back down and tried to fall asleep, we had our fan
going since</B>
<BR><B>it was hot in our bedroom.&nbsp; The fan was blowing on us all night
at 2:12am</B>
<BR><B>the air stopped blowing on us, then started again, as if someone
was</B>
<BR><B>standing in the way and then moving side to side.&nbsp; My husband
then felt a</B>
<BR><B>hand grab his foot, at the moment in time, he curled into a fetal
position</B>
<BR><B>and did not move all night.&nbsp; When we had woken up the next
morning at 630,</B>
<BR><B>he had asked me if I had tried to move the gate, I told him no why?&nbsp;
I</B>
<BR><B>walked out to see what he was talking about, and the gate was pulled
up from</B>
<BR><B>the floor almost 8 inches from where he had set it that night.&nbsp;
When we had</B>
<BR><B>discussed it later that day he had said that when he woken up to
go</B>
<BR><B>downstairs to get our son, he had to practically crawl through a
cave to get</B>
<BR><B>to him, he said that he was in a dark pit and the walls were dirt.&nbsp;
A few</B>
<BR><B>more times things like this have happened but nothing to that extent.&nbsp;
There</B>
<BR><B>have been many other times that I have seen things.&nbsp; I have
had many strange</B>
<BR><B>things happen to me since I was a little toddler mumbling things
in a</B>
<BR><B>foreign language.&nbsp; I have such a fear of the dark because I
can see things</B>
<BR><B>out of the corners of my eyes that I am ready to cry.&nbsp; I will
not even bring</B>
<BR><B>my trash out at night.&nbsp; I have gone to a friend who does hypnosis
and it has</B>
<BR><B>helped out some, but now I have more beings around to help me feel
as though</B>
<BR><B>I am never alone.&nbsp; I even leave the closet doors open so I
can see inside at</B>
<BR><B>all times.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>No One There</B><B></B>

<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>My daughter, who was 17 at the time, had gone on a trip to the mountains
with the church. She was going to where you can canoe under the mountain
inside a cave. They camped inside the cave.</B>
<BR><B>My 2 boys and I were sitting on my bed one night getting ready for
bed and just talking. My daughter wasn't due back for another day. We heard
the door open and close and the dog took off running and barking and my
daughter said like always "Mom I am home, Shut up Pierre" My oldest boy
said "Sheena is home early." I said "Yeah I wonder why." So we all got
up and went into the living room. Our dog was still barking. When we walked
into the room no one was there. The doors had the chains on them and still
locked. I would have thought it was just me but all of us heard her and
the dog did too.</B>
<BR><B>She come home the next night and we told her about our encounter.
She said nothing out of the ordinary had happened to her. A few minutes
later I got a call. It was my Mom telling me that one of my cousins on
my Dad's side that I haven't seen since I was 6 killed himself. I don't
know if that had anything to do with our encounter but the voice was clearly
my daughters, not a mans voice.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Ghostly Visit</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: ladyreading@earthlink.net</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>My name is Jan and I have a story from my childhood but I remember
it like yesterday. I am now 55 years old and when I was visited by my ghost
I was probably about 10 years old. I was sound asleep in my bedroom and
for some reason I woke up and sat up in bed wide awake. I looked to the
left of my bed toward the headboard. Standing there was an old man with
his arms hanging at his sides. He didn't move or make a sound. I don't
have any idea why I knew he was there. Needless to say I screamed as loud
as I could and both of my parents came running! As soon as I could talk
again I told them about the ghost at the head of my bed. When mom and dad
had come into my room they had turned the light on and they told me to
look, that there wasn't anything there. It was true I couldn't see anything
or anyone but I insisted he was still there. So of course we looked under
my bed and in my closet and then they had me walk to the kitchen and get
a drink of water. We all walked back to my bedroom where I was given a
kiss and tucked into bed. I was told I must have had a nightmare then my
parents turned out my light and went back to their room. Slowly I turned
my head to look back where I had seen the old man and sure enough there
he was still standing in that same pose and looking down at me! I pulled
the covers over my head and never fell back to sleep that night. It was
about 15 years ago that I received a picture of my great grand-father who
I had never met. There was a picture of my ghost! Yes, my great grand-father
died when I was around 10 years old!! This is a true story.</B>

<P><B>When I was a baby my mum used to put me at the bottom of the stairs
and I stared at the top of the stairs laughing so naturally my mum got
worried so she asked the previous owners of the house if they knew if anyone
had died there but the answer was no.&nbsp; A few weeks later she was sat
having a conversation witha bloke who was studying the supernatural because
he had, had an experience of that kind and he aksed her if she knew a woman
who was wearing a long brown skirt and a white shirt who had died recently
and that was a perfict discription of my mums aunti Joan who had recently
died!&nbsp; now I'm 12 and every night when i'm just getting settled down
to go to sleep I have a strange feeling that she's in my room looking out
for me.&nbsp; I sleep better knowing that she's there!</B>

<P><B>Haunted Warehouse</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: mullert90@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I used to work at a records storage warehouse in Chesterton, IN....First
I</B>
<BR><B>heard that my boss and friend saw a guy in a blue shirt walking
down the</B>
<BR><B>hall, past the doorway, but he vanished when they looked for him.&nbsp;
Other</B>
<BR><B>workers were always talking about hearing footsteps, and even I
a few times</B>
<BR><B>would see something blue from the corner of my eye.&nbsp; Very,
weird.&nbsp; Two guys,</B>
<BR><B>my friend Matt and his friend Jeremy one night, on the opposite
side of the</B>
<BR><B>building in another department, both heard a voice say Matt's name.&nbsp;
My good</B>
<BR><B>buddy Dave even says "Something passed through me," when he felt
a chill...</B>
<BR><B>But here's the topper:&nbsp; Ok, there's the big main warehouse
right next to a</B>
<BR><B>smaller warehouse area, followed by the "camera department" (they
put</B>
<BR><B>records onto microfilm, etc.).&nbsp; the camera department is surrounded
by a</B>
<BR><B>cluster of smaller rooms....Well, keep in mind that I'm about 25
at the</B>
<BR><B>time....One saturday I was working all alone with Kathy, and I mean</B>
<BR><B>ALONE....just us and this place was actually pretty creepy.&nbsp;
So for no good</B>
<BR><B>reason I decide it would be fun to wander the camera department,
by myself,</B>
<BR><B>with a flashlight.&nbsp; As I was going through one of the smaller
rooms, I heard</B>
<BR><B>a female voice call my Name!!!&nbsp; So, I just thought Kathy was
looking for me</B>
<BR><B>so I hightailed it back to my department...Of course she would never
yell at</B>
<BR><B>me anyway, but when I got back to her it was business as usual so
after a</B>
<BR><B>few minutes I asked if she called me and naturally, her answer was
"No."</B>
<BR><B>Wow.&nbsp; Others have reported female voices too...Creepy place.</B><B></B>

I would&nbsp; like to take time out and share my experiance with you!</B>
<BR><B>November&nbsp; 23rd,1988,2;00 of the morning.I had a spiritual visitor.This
visitor came into my bed room where I was just starting to relax and go
to sleep.I felt a presents,like someone was watching over me,at the end
of my bed.The spirit actually spoke to me.</B>
<BR><B>It told me not to be affraid.That I have to tell you that I am getting
ready to take your mother home to higher ground.The spirit was full of&nbsp;
wormth and the feeling of love.But,that spirit to take my own mother away
from me was totally out of the question!</B>
<BR><B>That scared me even more!</B>
<BR><B>My mom had been very sick.The doctors could not find what has been
wrong with her for several months.I&nbsp; was very close to her.She was
my goal that I wanted to be in this life.</B>
<BR><B>The spirit left my sight.But the warmth from the spirit actually
stayed with after all of these years.</B>
<BR><B>Well,I&nbsp; went to my mothers home to tell the news abouthe spiritual
visitor that I had.Well,there was like a force like not to tell anyone
about it.No matter how hard I tried to tell some one the words couldn't
be spoken about that&nbsp; early of that morning.So, after the family had
left the house,It was just my mom and I there.I told my mom what had happend
and what the spirit had told me.</B>
<BR><B>She said yes honey ,I am dieing.She layed her head on my shoulders
and we were both crying.She too had a dream that night of my spiritual
visitor as well.She said that she had seen a man in black standing in the
hall way.She was fighting him and telling him to leave.Was that devil that
everyone must face before leaving this world or was it just a dream?3 months
later ,I had my 2nd child. She was born with a deformitiy.My mother progress
with her health was falling very rapidly.Still now one knew what was wrong
with her.</B>
<BR><B>She was a very proud grandma no matter what was wrong with the baby.And
no matter what was wrong with her either!</B>
<BR><B>My little girl went through her surgery the same day that my mother
went through hers.Both , the child and the mother's dignoses were not too
good.I was running back and forth.Confused and so scared.</B>
<BR><B>No sleep in days.So,It finelly ended on March 7th my child was clinically
dead and my mother had past on,from cancer in the pancrease.I had given
up.My life was all torn appart.The nurse came to me and told me that my
child was going to live once I had that lost fealing like I never had before
in my life.</B>
<BR><B>The lost of my mother always sadden me.But,I know that she's in
a better place.And my little girl today is healthy and so pretty.The ironic
thing of it,that my little girl has all of the traits of my mom and all
of her looks!</B>

<BR><B>Story</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Donald Richards</B><B></B>

<P><B>In 1996 I started working at a Haunted House in</B>
<BR><B>Orlando Florida. The House was called Terror On Church</B>
<BR><B>Street. There were many experiences in this house that</B>
<BR><B>were unexplained. There were sounds that we didn't</B>
<BR><B>understand like a baby crying in a distance, teen aged</B>
<BR><B>girl screaming right next to your face, falling</B>
<BR><B>objects when no one was in room, baby impression on</B>
<BR><B>the exorcist's bed, and images in a distance. My</B>
<BR><B>personal experience involved but not limited to one</B>
<BR><B>experience. I was working on the exorcist bed that</B>
<BR><B>night waiting to scare the next group of guest. Well</B>
<BR><B>like usual I started to doze off while waiting. Next</B>
<BR><B>thing I know I feel some one firmly grabbed my left</B>
<BR><B>leg almost like telling me to get up. I looked up and</B>
<BR><B>at first I thought I saw another actor who was wearing</B>
<BR><B>a clown outfit that night be just a the actor looked</B>
<BR><B>at me I felt their hand let go and the person</B>
<BR><B>disappeared. I first tried to play it off as a dream</B>
<BR><B>but my eyes didn't blink till I hit the exit door. I</B>
<BR><B>freaked out and asked every actor if they went by my</B>
<BR><B>set. They didn't only because the group that was</B>
<BR><B>supposes to come in chickened out and no one made it</B>
<BR><B>to set but me. From that point on I started looking at</B>
<BR><B>haunted stories in a different light. I kept working</B>
<BR><B>there for many years after but I always kept that one</B>
<BR><B>experience in the back of my mind.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>babies and waited for it to stop but it didn't. now i</B>
<BR><B>have always heard noises in the attic and that never</B>
<BR><B>bothered me but i never heard music because there were</B>
<BR><B>no plugs up there. so we sat for awhile listening but</B>
<BR><B>it didn't stop.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so we both got the courage to get up and
go up to</B>
<BR><B>the attic, we went up very slowly and i mean slow like</B>
<BR><B>turtles holdin onto eachother. we fianlly got to the</B>
<BR><B>top when we realized the song " i only have eyes for</B>
<BR><B>you" the scary thing is about that is because i hate</B>
<BR><B>that song because my grandfather always used to listen</B>
<BR><B>to it but he passed on. anyways we got to the top of</B>
<BR><B>the stairs and opened the door.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the middle of the floor there was an
old radio</B>
<BR><B>that looked like it was made in the 1900's and it was</B>
<BR><B>never there before, because up there was where my</B>
<BR><B>friends would sleep so nothing was up there except a</B>
<BR><B>bed and a mirror and a dresser and drapes. girlie</B>
<BR><B>stuff. so we walked over to the radio and we stared at</B>
<BR><B>it. then i leaned over and turned it off and shut the</B>
<BR><B>lid. the scariest thing was it was still playing but</B>
<BR><B>there were weird sounds of a man screaming while the</B>
<BR><B>song was playing it was a mixture of both of them. so</B>
<BR><B>i screamed at the top of my lungs. and then Sebastian</B>
<BR><B>said to the radio "shut up, and leave us alone" then</B>
<BR><B>he was flown back on my bed by something. i looked at</B>
<BR><B>him frightened. then i went over to him and got him</B>
<BR><B>off the bed and we walked to the door, i opened it and</B>
<BR><B>then sebastian fell and i was pushed by something hard</B>
<BR><B>and as i was falling the same thing that pushed me</B>
<BR><B>grabbed me and threw me on the floor. now i am not a</B>
<BR><B>brave person so i was crying my head off. then as i</B>
<BR><B>was sitting there a little girl came from the corner</B>
<BR><B>and she had a black long dress on her hair down in</B>
<BR><B>ringlets and it was red and she said " you must leave</B>
<BR><B>here now, my daddy is really angry, go get out please"</B>
<BR><B>so me and Sebastian got up real quick and ran</B>
<BR><B>downstairs to my room and we got some clothes together</B>
<BR><B>and we left and went to my sisters and stayed there</B>
<BR><B>for two weeks because my parents were gone away.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; when we got back i went up in the attic
and to me</B>
<BR><B>and Sebastians surprise there was no radio or anything</B>
<BR><B>scary up there, just my normal room.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; after that nothing ever happened, little
things</B>
<BR><B>hear and there but i know that it's just the little</B>
<BR><B>girl playing and i always tell her "go away now</B>
<BR><B>please" and nothing happens until the next day.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;thank you for reading my story. i have plenty more to</B>
<BR><B>tell you but i think i should leave that up to my friend.</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B><B></B>

<P><B>The following is a true depiction of our adventures living in a haunted
house. Although I have been called “crazy” by more than a few people with
regards to this story, I assure you the events described herein are true
and actually did happen. I share them now with you, as best I can recollect.</B>
<BR><B>#222</B>
<BR><B>In 1994, my husband and I moved our family (4 kids - aged 3, 6,
10 and 14) to a small seaside town on the east central coast of Florida.
We’d found our dream home -- 4/2, in-ground pool, 2600sf, priced 20,000
under market value, less than 3 miles from the beach -- Perfect! It was
a little run down, but we figured what we saved on the purchase price we
could put into fixing it up. I was a good thing we were in that mindset.
Almost immediately, our nightmare began.</B>
<BR><B>On our 3rd night in the house, there was a horrendous thunderstorm,
one of those tropical blasters we often get down here in FL. The next morning
I awoke to discover that we had lost a couple of trees to the storm. The
first was a 40 foot cottonwood tree that stood off the side of the front
porch. It was close to the house and had branches that hung well over the
roof. It fell in an eastward direction across the front yard (the house
faces due south) leaving a 5 foot crater in the yard. There was only one
place this tree could have fallen and not hit anything and that is where
it fell. The branches did not even scrape the roof or gutters going down.
It was weird. It gets weirder.</B>
<BR><B>The other was a lemon tree growing in the backyard. It was a much
smaller tree, about 8 feet tall with a 5 inch trunk base. It had fallen
in a westward direction, exactly opposite the tree in the front yard. It
had also been uprooted. Since it was a mature tree and bore fruit, I decided
to try and save it. I dug out the hole and re-planted it. Three days later,
I found the tree uprooted, lying on the ground in the same westward direction.
I chalked it up to the kids, and re-planted it, again. This time I tied
it to stakes to help hold it up and let it take root. Six days later, I
found it again, uprooted, lying westward. The stakes and wire I had tied
it up with were gone -- not lying on the ground with or near the tree --
just gone. I questioned the kids. They claimed to know nothing. I tried
a couple more times to save this tree only to find it again and again uprooted
and lying westward. I finally gave up on it.</B>
<BR><B>Another interesting tidbit about the trees: there were 3 citrus
trees in the backyard, an orange, a tangerine and a lemon. We lost the
lemon tree to the storm, but -- here’s the strange part -- the orange and
tangerine trees never bore one piece of edible fruit the entire time we
lived there. The trees were full of fruit that looked good on the outside,
but every piece was rotten and foul-smelling on the inside. Yuck!</B>
<BR><B>In the meantime, things were going weird inside the house as well.
We immediately started having trouble with all things electrical. It was
really strange. We would get what I call ‘dead zones’ throughout the house.
Nothing electrical would work within that zone -- all the light switches
and electrical outlets would be dead. It was completely random and would
last for several days or even weeks. First it would be the foyer and living
room, then it would move to the hall or the back porch or to one of the
bedrooms. There were times when we’ve had to use extension cords to keep
the refrigerator plugged in! We replaced fuses. We replaced breakers. We
replaced wiring. Hell, we replaced the entire fuse box! Nothing worked.
It continued, off and on, until the day we moved out.</B>
<BR><B>Next came the appliances. Every appliance in the house died a sudden
and systematic death. It started with the garbage disposal. I was cleaning
up after dinner and was about to turn on the disposer. As I leaned over
to turn the faucet on, I caught this rancid smell coming up from the drain.
I have never smelled anything like it before or since. I flipped the switch
for the disposer. It immediately started making God-awful noises. I backed
up. Good thing, too. A large metal thing came whizzing past my head (I
actually felt the breeze) and knocked a chunk out of the cabinet on the
opposite wall behind me. It turned out to be one of the blades. From there
it went downhill. Next came the dishwasher, then the stove, the refrigerator,
the washing machine....you get the picture. I lived in this house for 5
years and went through 2 garbage disposals, 2 dishwashers, 1 stove, 2 refrigerators,
3 washing machines and 1 dryer. Did I forget to mention and endless tirade
of alarm clocks, toasters, telephones, and every other small appliance
you can think of?</B>
<BR><B>But wait! It gets even better! One afternoon, I was coming back
from picking the kids up from school. I hit the garage door opener and
the door went up. No problem. As I started to pull in, the entire door
suddenly came crashing down from the ceiling. It missed the car by mere
inches. I called the garage door company. They put up a brand new door.
New hardware and rails, too. Three weeks later, it came crashing down again.
They put it up again. It came down again and so on. No one could explain
why it kept falling. We ended up in a lawsuit with the garage door company
because they refused, after a while, to come back and work on it anymore.
We eventually stopped using the garage for anything other than storage.</B>
<BR><B>As if all this weren’t enough, we started getting a lot of interference
on the phones, the televisions and on the computer. In addition to turning
on and off by itself, the TV would cut in and out -- usually just static
or else the screen would blank. Same thing on the computer. Files would
also go missing on the computer and, every now and then, it would just
freak out completely. Restarting it did no good. I went through 3 hard
drives, 2 modems and 2 motherboards in 5 years. Add to that 2 printers.
Starting to see a pattern here?</B>
<BR><B>The phones were what was really creepy. Nearly every time you used
the phone, at least once (sometimes more), a loud burst of static would
cut in. Sometimes all you heard was the static. Other times you could hear
voices through the static. They were always garbled and you could never
quite make out what they were saying. Sometimes. Once -- and this one still
sends chills down my spine -- I heard a male voice say hello to me and
call me by name. Then, laughter. I hung up on who I was talking to. The
static and the voices could be heard on both ends of the line. People would
often ask me “what the hell was that?” or “did you hear that?” while on
the phone with me. Creeeepy!!!!!!!!!!</B>
<BR><B>The phones were also often victims of the ‘dead zones’. The phone
company replaced -- not repaired -- replaced the phone jacks and wiring
in this house 8 times over a 5 year period. Thank God for that inside wire
maintenance plan! It got so I knew most of the BellSouth repairmen by name.
They could never fix it, though. The phone problem also continued, unabated,
until the day we moved out.</B>
<BR><B>Now, keep in mind that all of these things happened within the first
year or so of our living here. We were convinced that we had bought the
house from hell! Well, it was around this time that I began to take notice
of what (or should I say whom) was causing all the trouble. My children
noticed much sooner than I did, but were afraid to tell me about it. They
have since shared many of their experiences with me. I won’t get into their
tales, right now. I’ll just concentrate on my own experiences.</B>
<BR><B>It all started (for me) with a shower. What is it about bathrooms,
anyway? I was in the master bath and just rinsing the soap out of my hair
when I heard a loud knock on the shower door. It spooked me. I turned to
look. Nothing there. I opened the shower door. Again, nothing there. Now,
being a mom with 4 kids, I have learned never to take a shower without
locking the bathroom door. I assure you, I was alone. I just didn’t feel
alone. I dismissed it, however, and continued with my shower at a somewhat
quicker pace. Sure enough, another knock came, same as before. Since I
have had experiences similar to this in the past, I figured the best thing
to do was to confront the spirit and tell it to leave me alone. Most of
the time this works. I defiantly faced the shower door and said, “Okay,
knock it off!” No sooner had the words left my lips than the lights went
out. BAM!</B>
<BR><B>So here I am, naked, wet, water running, standing in the dark ready
to jump out of my skin! If anything had actually touched me at that moment,
someone would have had to summon the little men in the white coats! I eventually
gathered enough courage to turn off the water and slowly feel my way down
the wall to the door. When I got to the door and opened it, I discovered
that the lights were off in the master bedroom as well. It stayed that
way for 2 days. ‘Dead zone’ in the master bed and bath!</B>
<BR><B>It was like we were living in the middle of a virtual cornucopia
of paranormal activity here. We had apparitions. We had poltergeist activity.
We heard voices both inside and outside the house, not to mention through
the phones and radios. Lights and TV’s and stereos would turn off and on
by themselves -- you know the drill. But, let’s slow down a minute. I don’t
want to give the impression that this was going on 24-7-365. It sort of
came in waves. A kind of ebb and flow, if you will. I also believe that
there was more than one spirit residing in this house. In fact, I believe
there to be several. This is where the story gets a little complicated,
so I’ll try and explain as best I can. Stay with me!</B>
<BR><B>The majority of poltergeist activity (things moving around, pounding,
knocking on shower doors - you know, the scary stuff) were more prominent
during the holiday months, from about October until January. Even then,
they weren’t occurring every day, just every now and then. This spirit
liked to scare you. It also liked the element of surprise. Things would
be quiet for awhile and then -- BOO! Usually when you were alone (naturally).
This one liked to keep you on your toes! Every once in a while, though,
it would cause you to pack up and go spend the afternoon at the mall or
the movies.</B>
<BR><B>The telephone and electrical problems not withstanding, the mainstays
were a large shadowy figure that would pass in front of the picture window
in the front of the house. It would always pass from left to right, and
then a few minutes later, would pass back from right to left. I saw it
everyday, sometimes as many as 5 or 6 times. At least it was outside.</B>
<BR><B>From about late spring through the end of summer, you would often
hear the voices of two men arguing in the backyard on the far side of the
pool (under the citrus trees), usually around dusk. They would really go
at it -- screaming, cursing, scuffling. As soon as you looked out a window
or stepped onto the back porch it would stop and there would, of course,
be nothing. The first time we heard it, my daughter and I thought that
the neighbors were fighting. We were literally out in the backyard peering
over fences! Again, at least they were outside.</B>
<BR><B>We also had a Peeping Tom that would stand outside my oldest daughter’s
bedroom window. Just stand there and smile. He was a solid apparition,
none of this mist or transparency nonsense. This guy looked real. He was
a thirtyish man dressed in dark slacks, a white button-down shirt and tie
(office attire), and had dark hair, bushy eyebrows and a moustache. The
first time I saw him I actually started to walk up to him and ask him what
the hell he thought he was doing peeping in windows. He looked right at
me and smiled, then promptly disappeared. I’ve seen him exactly twice.
My daughter says she would see him a couple of times a week or more beginning
from the first night we slept in the house.</B>
<BR><B>There were also spirits residing inside the house with us. The most
prominent was male, I don’t know his age or even how I know he was male
-- I just got the distinct feeling this spirit was male. He’s the door
knocking, light switching guy I met in the shower. This one seemed to have
an affinity for me, much like the Peeping Tom had an affinity for my daughter.
Go figure.</B>
<BR><B>In addition to flipping light switches and knocking on doors, one
of this spirit’s favorite tricks was to sit down next to you on the sofa
while you were watching TV. I had a leather sofa and loveseat, so it was
obvious whenever he would sit down. You could hear the leather creak and
could see the depression in the sofa cushions. If you would move to another
seat, he would follow and sit next to you again. Every once in a while
he would actually reach out and touch you. I have felt him, at different
times, rub the back of my neck, squeeze my knee and put his hand over mine
-- all while he was sitting next to me. I had a problem with this. Each
time I would jump up screaming “Don‘t touch me!” -- I‘m sorry, this really
freaked me out. I cannot abide the touching. Eventually, it stopped (the
touching part, anyway). He did have a dislike for my husband, however.
He used to lock him out of the bedroom quite often, even locked him out
of the house on several occasions.</B>
<BR><B>The guy who showed up around the holidays was a pretty malevolent
spirit. Like I said, this guy liked to scare you. His spirit was strong
but of relatively short duration. Thank God! I also think that this was
the voice we all heard on the phone, but I can‘t be sure (maybe it was
the one who liked to squeeze my knee). Who can tell?</B>
<BR><B>Now, at this point I’m sure that most of you are dying to ask why
we stayed in this house, with all this ‘interesting’ stuff going on, for
3 years. Actually, it was 5 (more like 4 and a half). Next question: Why
didn’t we pack up our belongings and get the hell out of dodge? Good question.</B>
<BR><B>It was more a matter of having to stay rather than wanting to stay.
At this point we were up to our eyeballs in the house. We had to take out
a second, and then a third mortgage to pay for the electrical repairs along
with some plumbing and pool repairs (which I will get to in a minute).
This, after having only lived in the house for about 3 years. Add to that
the everyday expense of feeding, clothing, educating and sheltering a family
of 6. Enough said. Sometimes that prize behind door number 3 is just a
turd in a box.</B>
<BR><B>We were learning to live with it as a family. What other choice
did we have? After a while, it became sort of routine. It’s hard to explain.
After a while, you come to know that someone’s going to knock on the door
when you get a shower, you expect it. When you hear fighting in the backyard,
you don’t even go to the window anymore. All the electrical and telephone
nuisances became a standing joke after a while. Most of the spirits seemed
harmless enough -- I mean, they never tried to do anything other than annoy
or scare us. They never tried to do us any real harm. The spirits usually
only messed with you when you were alone. One advantage (at least in this
instance) of living amongst a large family is that there is no such thing
as privacy. Alone time is often scarce. Of course, every once in a while,
I would step on one of my kids getting out of bed because they’re lying
on the floor beside me or because we’ve spent the night 5 in a bed. We
do what we gotta do.</B>
<BR><B>So now we’re up to summer 1997. This is when things really started
to pick up. My oldest daughter (then 16) was having a sleepover with some
friends -- 3 to be exact. I had to drive one of the girls home at 2:30
in the morning because she was hysterical and refused to stay the rest
of the night at our house. She saw the Peeping Tom in the window. What
I didn’t know then, but later discovered, is that the girls had been playing
with a Quiga Board. Not a good idea. Especially in this house. More especially
if you are a group of kids and have no idea what you are doing.</B>
<BR><B>Things got gradually worse over the next 18 months or so. Two more
tragic financial events occurred back to back near the end of that summer.
Suddenly, one afternoon, for no apparent reason, the pool filter exploded.
It was something to see. It blew the top of the filter housing about 50-60
ft straight up in the air! It landed on the roof. So, okay -- $560 for
a new pool filter. The following week the pump motor froze up. Okay --
another $380 for a new pool pump. Let’s not forget to tack on installation.
I certainly don’t know how to install a pool filter, do you? Don’t forget,
we also have to fix the roof.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O joy!</B>
<BR><B>Now, for benefit of those of you who don’t own a pool, let me fill
you in on what a pain in the ass it is to have your pool equipment down
and not working. It doesn’t take long for the water to go funky. It starts
to grow algae. In the heat of summer in Florida it can start to look like
a catfish pond in about a week. So in addition to repairing the equipment,
you now get to spend the next week or so riding a brush attached to a long
pole and pouring about $80-$100 worth of chemicals in twice a day on a
daily basis until you can begin to see the bottom of the pool again! Oh,
sorry. I’m digressing.</B>
<BR><B>Within 2 months of the pool equipment disaster, the plumbing started
acting up. First, the toilets. When you flushed, raw sewage would back
up into the toilets, sinks, tubs and showers. Time to call Roto-Rooter!
That worked for awhile. A couple months later, same thing. Time to call
Roto-Rooter again!</B>
<BR><B>Three days after the Roto-Rooter man left, the plumbing exploded
in the master bathroom. Three weeks after that, and while the master bath
was still under repair, the plumbing exploded in the other bathroom. It
was awful. It happened in the middle of the night. We woke up to find 3
inches of water covering about 2/3 of the house. There was a river of water
running out the back door onto the covered porch. It got everything --
carpets, walls, furniture, clothes, 2 TV’s, 3 stereos and the computer.</B>
<BR><B>This was also a financial disaster. The insurance paid us roughly
$12,000 for about $35,000 worth of repairs. Ever since Hurricane Andrew
hit south Florida, insurance coverage in this state is a nightmare. It
is horrendously expensive and the coverage is squat. The insurance company
said something about pipes not being covered because they were considered
a maintenance item. A maintenance item? Please. I ask you, when was the
last time you opened up your walls and checked your pipes? Sorry, digressing
again.</B>
<BR><B>The bad news about the plumbing was that the house sat on a concrete
slab. All of the pipes and plumbing were poured into the slab, naturally.
So now we have 2 choices: dig up the floors and the underlying concrete
slab to find the breaks and repair the pipes, or cut off the old plumbing
system and re-route all new pipes through the attic. Option number 2 was
cheaper. Now we embark on a six month long construction project. Water
on, water off. Electricity on, electricity off. Old carpet out. New carpet
in. You get the picture.</B>
<BR><B>The spirits, naturally, couldn't resist messing with the hired help.
Over the next 6 months, we had 3 different plumbing contractors. The first
guy left for lunch and didn’t come back. He called me 4 days later (after
I had left about a half dozen messages on his voice mail) and told me I
needed to look for a new contractor. He would never say why. He gave me
back my deposit, too. We also had 3 different drywall crews and 2 different
flooring crews. These guys just didn‘t like working in my house for some
reason!</B>
<BR><B>Once the plumbing was in and the drywall put up, I started on the
painting/papering stage of our little renovation project. One morning,
as I was hanging paper in the dining room, the doorbell rang. I opened
the door to see a tall, gaunt, black man standing outside the security
gate. [The front porch was entirely enclosed by wrought iron security bars
and a gate. The kids referred to it as “the cage”. On this particular day
I was glad that it was a locking gate.]</B>
<BR><B>This man proceeded to tell me that he was a Jehovah’s Witness and
would like to come inside and talk to me about his faith. Hallelujah! Naturally,
I began making polite excuses. This guy wouldn’t take “no” for an answer.
He kept insisting that I let him inside. The more I would decline, the
more insistent he would become. This began to annoy me. I rather gruffly
told the man that I was not interested and would not let him come inside
my house. I turned to go back inside. As I reached the front door (about
6 ft from the gate), the man suddenly said, “Open the gate.” It did not
sound like a request. I turned to confront him and there was no one there.
I walked to the gate. He was gone -- not on the sidewalk, not in the driveway,
not on the street -- gone. All I can say is if this guy wanted in, he wasn’t
getting an invitation from me.</B>
<BR><B>By fall, we were back to some semblance of order. The construction
phase had come and gone and things were being put back in their usual places
instead of being piled up out in the garage. Then out of the blue, in September,
my oldest daughter (just newly turned 17) was in a serious car accident.
She survived, but was pretty banged up. When she came home from the hospital,
I set her up in the living room so I could better take care of her -- she
could barely walk for about a week. The entire time she stayed in the living
room (about 10 days) things were rockin’ and rollin’ in her room. Her stereo
would go on and off almost constantly, even when it was unplugged. Some
days it sounded like someone was moving furniture in there. When you would
open the door, though, everything would look normal and in it’s place.</B>
<BR><B>One afternoon in particular, she and I were in the kitchen eating
lunch. The stereo had come on a couple of times already and we had each
taken turns at going in and shutting if off. Auuugh! Here we go again!
It was my turn, so I ventured in and turned it off. I also pulled the plug
from the wall and draped it across the front of the unit (not the first
time I had done that today). By now, I had taken to confronting the spirits
when they would play their pranks, so I hollered, “Enough with the stereos.
Knock it off!”. I then closed the door and went back to the kitchen. Like
I said before, most times this works. A loud pounding started in my daughter’s
room. It traveled down the hall, down the wall through the den and ended
just outside the kitchen door. It was really loud, I mean, it rattled the
walls. We both decided it was time to go catch a matinee.</B>
<BR><B>Now, here’s where the Quiga Board comes back into play. Wait a minute!
Don’t panic! I didn’t do something as stupid as try to use it to contact
the spirits that haunt my home or anything. I simply found it. It was underneath
my daughter’s bed. I found it when we were moving her back into her room
from the living room. I asked about it. This is when I discovered that
the girls had been playing with the Quiga Board at their sleepover some
months earlier. This would explain why, as of late, things were becoming
more and more frequent. Especially the poltergeist activity. I vehemently
explained to my daughter the inherent dangers of “playing with” a Quiga
Board in a house where spirits already exist. Not only did they succeed
in making the existing ones stronger, they likely invited others to join
in the fray, so to speak (this may explain the over insistent, black, bible
thumper that rang my bell). Oh, no. The Quiga Board had to go.</B>
<BR><B>Simpleton that I was, I put it out with the trash. Ha! Ha! Ha! My
daughter brought it to me 3 days later. She found it under her bed. This
was not a good sign. This time we destroyed it, the both of us. I mean,
we literally mutilated it. We took out all of the fear and frustration
we had been subjected to thus far on this poor little cardboard and plastic
game from Milton Bradley. I put it in a dumpster behind a Winn Dixie nearly
20 miles away from where we lived. I haven’t seen it since.</B>
<BR><B>Getting rid of the Quiga Board didn’t calm things down at the house
much. The kids and I took off and spent 3 weeks up in Georgia with my mom
and dad over the holidays. The hubby was spending less and less time at
home, anyway. It was getting to be too much. When we returned home after
the holidays, things were actually very quiet. A welcome change.</B>
<BR><B>Then one afternoon, my daughter showed me something very strange.
In the ceiling, over her bed, holes were appearing. They were very small
and were appearing in a random pattern -- first there were 5 or 6, then
there were 15-17, then there were 25-30 and so on. They looked almost as
if someone had taken a knitting needle and poked a series of holes in the
ceiling. After about 2 weeks or so they began to show the shape of a face.
This creeped my daughter out to no end. I got a can of spackling compound
and filled the holes in. We moved her bed to the other side of the room.
A week later, I found her pet Love Bird (one she had gotten for her birthday
the summer before) lying behind the bedroom door in the corner with it’s
neck broken. The holes then began re-appearing in the ceiling over her
bed (even though it had been moved). We repeated (several times) the same
routine with filling in the holes and moving the bed. The holes eventually
stopped appearing in late January/early February of 98.</B>
<BR><B>Shortly after this occurred, I had my own encounter. Before I begin,
I need to give you a little layout information first. The house was “L”
shaped, single story, split-plan. The master bed was on the east end of
the house. The kitchen, dining room, living room and foyer mainly covered
the center portion of the house. Coming out of the kitchen, on the west
end (in the crook of the “L“), was a den that connected on the other end
to a short hall that led to the remaining bedrooms and bath. The east wall
of the den had an impressive 10 ft wide glass door that overlooked an enclosed
Florida Room running the entire length of the back of the house. Off the
back of the Florida Room is where the pool was situated. I hope I’m not
confusing anyone. It was actually a pretty cool setup. From either the
kitchen (big window in the kitchen) or the den you could see the entire
backyard pool area. I had the den set up as an office so I could work and
still keep an eye on the kids in the backyard.</B>
<BR><B>Now back to the story. I was working late at the computer one night
(about 12:30 am) when something hit the glass doors hard enough to rattle
them in the frame. I swung around in my chair. There was nothing. Now,
remember, I can see the entire back porch, the pool and a major portion
of the backyard from where I’m sitting. The glass doors had no curtains,
no blinds, anything of that nature, and I was sitting a mere 6-7 feet from
it. Believe me, there was nothing. I dismissed it (as I so often do) and
turned back to the computer. About 15 minutes later, something hit the
door again -- hard. This time, when I swung around, the door began violently
shaking. It was about to rattle itself out of the frame. I was truly afraid
that it was going to fall in. Now, ironically enough, my only thought at
this point was how expensive it was going to be to replace this door. So
I got up, crossed over to the door and tried to hold it up, hoping I could
prevent it from falling in. Do we see a mental degradation pattern going
on here? The moment I put my hands on the glass, the shaking stopped. Then
I heard -- and I will never forget this -- laughter. I let go of the door
as though it were hot and backed away. I promptly turned off the computer
and went to bed. I said I went to bed, I never said I got any sleep.</B>
<BR><B>Things were really starting to get weird, now. We were all starting
to be plagued by nightmares. The poltergeist activity, which usually ended
after the holidays, didn’t. The sleeping 5 to a bed stuff was becoming
more and more frequent.</B>
<BR><B>Then, in the spring, I began to notice bruises on my oldest daughter.
She would often have bruises in the shape of fingers on her upper arms,
wrists and on her ankles. Once she had a horrific looking bruise about
8 inches long across her buttock and upper thigh. It looked like someone
had hit her with a stick or a belt -- something long and thin. I questioned
her. Her response was that she didn’t know how she got them, she just woke
up with them. These were some nasty bruises. I’m sorry, but you don’t get
bruises like that and not remember where they came from. I figured she
was covering for someone, most likely her then boyfriend. Needless to say,
I had a little chat with the then boyfriend. I embarrassed myself. It turned
out not to be him. Guess who it was? My daughter soon stopped sleeping
in her room. When she did, the bruises quit appearing. She didn’t sleep
in her room for our last 6 months in the house. Can’t say I blame her.</B>
<BR><B>You’ll remember that I said before something to the effect of the
spirits being harmless for the most part, and not trying to do harm? Here’s
where my thinking begins to change on that subject. There was one final
incident that helped make up my mind for me.</B>
<BR><B>I forgot to fill you in on the pool, other than the pool equipment
disaster, that is. Every so often, while swimming, you would hear a splash
at the other end of the pool (it was always behind you). As you turn around,
you see no one. You do, however, see ripples on the surface, as if someone
had just jumped in. It was just enough to scare you out of the pool and
it would only happen when you were alone. At least, you only noticed it
when you were alone.</B>
<BR><B>One evening around dusk, I was in the pool with 2 of the kids. The
kids had gotten out and gone to hit the showers. I straggled behind, floating
on my back in the deep end. There was no warning. I hadn’t heard any noises
nor mystery splashes whatsoever. Suddenly, something grabbed my left ankle
and pulled me underwater, straight to the bottom (we‘re talking 13 feet
of water, here). I struggled, but I couldn‘t get free. I was running out
of air. I started to panic. Then, just as suddenly as it had grabbed me,
it let me go. I immediately went for the side and climbed out. I lay there
on the pool deck, gasping, for I don’t know how long. I was literally scared
shitless! It, whatever it was, had just tried to drown me! This happened
in early May. We moved in June, one week after my daughter’s high school
graduation. I later learned that both my son and one of my daughters had
also had near-drowning experiences. That’s it. We’re out of here.</B>
<BR><B>We initially put the house up for sale. I was a little conscious
ridden about the disclosure thing, but then, nobody told us about it, right?
It turned out not to be a problem. We moved all the furniture to our new
house, a rental 50 miles away. We returned 2 days later to clean and gather
up the remaining junk we had in the garage. I couldn’t believe what I saw
when we returned. Water was cascading down the driveway, a literal river.
Someone had turned on every faucet in the house and plugged the drains
with rags. We assume the water had been running for 2 days. The entire
house was flooded.</B>
<BR><B>In addition, every window in the house had been smashed. There were
huge holes knocked into the walls and ceilings. The new toilets we had
put in were shattered. The mirrors were smashed, the light fixtures and
fans ripped down from the ceilings, etc. It was catastrophic. There was
no way in hell we could afford to pay to fix all of this. Forget selling
it. We did the only thing we could, under the circumstances. We filed a
police report for the vandalism. We then did a deed in lieu of foreclosure
and gave the house back to the bank. It was sold at auction. And here,
our nightmare ends.</B>
<BR><B>An interesting footnote to this story comes from my oldest daughter.
About a year after we had moved away, my daughter returned to visit some
friends. While she was in town, she decided to take a run by the old house
and see what had become of it. As she pulled up and stopped in front of
the house, a young girl (about 7 or 8) walked up to the car and asked my
daughter if she used to live there. They had never laid eyes on each other
before, but somehow this girl knew. The girl invited my daughter to come
inside the house. At first, she was reluctant, but her curiosity got the
better of her.</B>
<BR><B>She ended up staying for about an hour, chatting with the new owners.
They had a lot of questions. She discovered, from their chat, that the
new owners were still having problems with the phone, the wiring and the
plumbing. They also replaced the garage door, again. In addition, they
had found both of their pet birds (a macaw and a cockatiel) dead. One’s
neck had been broken. The other had been decapitated. The girl my daughter
had met in the driveway had just recently been taken for psychiatric evaluation
by her parents because she was plagued with nightmares and claimed to be
“seeing things” in her room (she occupied the Peeping Tom room). She also
didn’t like to go swimming...&nbsp;</B>
