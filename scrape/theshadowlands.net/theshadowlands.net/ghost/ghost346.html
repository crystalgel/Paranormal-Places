<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">My family
and I stayed at the Manresa Castle Port Townsend, Wa.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We stayed in room 306, where the woman killed
herself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We didn't know before hand all
the creepy things that has happened there.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But a few of our creepy experiences was that at night, the windows were
fogged, and I shut the blinds. NOTHING was on the windows.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the morning when the windows were still
fogged, I opened the blinds to find a pentagram draw on the window.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My family and I are all strong Christians,
and would never even think of drawing that as a "joke". Also, in the
middle of the night I woke up to my head board of my bed slamming against the
wall... My sister was sound asleep and didn't hear a thing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My parents in the other room didn't hear it
either.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But my grandma (who was on a
roll away bed in the same room as I) heard it and woke up too.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We both sat straight up, and I finally said "What
is that?" and it stopped suddenly.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To this day, we don't know what it was. I don't believe in ghosts, but
that was very unexplainable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">This
3-story, 18 room Victorian (well, Queen Anne) home was built in 1856 for John
Cleves Symmes and his bride-to-be.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
was purchased in the early 1900s by Judge Stanley Struble and his wife.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My then-husband and I purchased it in 1972
from the estate of Mrs. Struble, then a widow.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Judge was instrumental in 1940's </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Cincinnati</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">
legislature, and was also a staunch Mason.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">It had
been divided into 2 apartments when we purchased it, and within a few months we
knocked out some walls and restored it to it's original one-family home.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">There are
3 small rooms on the 3rd floor...<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One
overlooks the front yard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The other two
rooms held pictures, documents, legal briefs, etc., from the Judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Many of his books, files, and notes were also
housed in a Carriage House (outbuilding).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I found them quite fascinating, and wondered if the local Historical
Society would be interested.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Meanwhile,
things kept "appearing" inside the house, mostly in the kitchen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was my habit to put the breakfast dishes
in hot, soapy water, then drive our sons to pre-school, then come home and do
the dishes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On several occasions, old
kitchen utensils I never had, or knew of, would be in the sink to be
washed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also, my sons told me they would
see a man looking out the 3rd floor window, watching them as they played.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My sons are now 34 and 37, and maintain this
vision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their description is that of the
Judge.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">The house
has a "cold spot," between the kitchen and the dining room, at the
foot of the private stairwell (boarded over when we purchased the home) that
led directly to a 2nd story bedroom - supposedly direct access to the servants'
quarters, also the room of a retarded child.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I do not know if this was a child of Symmes', or Struble's, and we never
got around to opening the stairwell.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">What
convinced me this house was haunted?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
exact date eludes me, because this was over 30 years ago, but I was getting
ready to go to my monthly Eastern Star meeting.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I showered and did my hair in the small 2nd story bathroom, went into
the large bedroom to finish dressing, and the Judge's clothing (an aged
tuxedo), had been laid out on the bed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And I was the only one home.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I will
tell you, I always felt safe in that home.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Sadly, it is now in disrepair, dying...<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It's a home crying out for love and attention, I believe.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not a malicious bone (beam?) anywhere.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I honestly
don't believe in ghosts, but I do believe in energy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was an energy in that home that I can't
put into words.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A GOOD energy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">And, on
that note, I thank you for the web site you have developed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was forwarded to me by a dear friend.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">It all
started when I was 8. I was a really into scary stories and all. I had always
wanted to look at a real ghost. Of course I would tell my friends and family
about this and they would just laugh. I wanted to prove them wrong. So one
bright evening, I decided to go next door to my neighbors house. I had never
known him, but my parents sure did. Every day they came back from his house
they would say "There's something weird about that man." So I
wondered why they said that. That evening, I went over to his house and gave
him a visit. "Hello, my name is Vanessa, I'm the daughter of those people
who come here every week." I said in a nervous voice. "Oh, your their
daughter, well, come in, I have some cookies for you," he said with a
friendly voice and a warm smile. I started talking to him and asked, "How
much time have you been living here?" "A long time now," he
said. I told him I had lived in my house for 4 years. We had a nice talk after
that and soon I left. I didn't see why my parents had said that he was a weird
old man. So they told me. "Because he said that he has lived in this house
since it was built if he's 65, and this house was built in the year 1990, he
would be 12 years old," my mom said. "He's an old man, he
forgets," I said. I talked to the owner of this house, and asked him if a
man named <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Drake F.
had been living here since 1990. He said no, the man had moved in the year
1991. He was 54 years old. So I thought it made sense. Then the owner,
Mr.Garcia said, he died at the year 2000. Huh, what, what? I felt scared, it
was the year 2002, and that man still lives next door? I had a really scary
feeling, and then told my parents, of course, they laughed. No one ever
believed me. I went to the old man's house the next day, and knocked, no one
answered. I knocked again, this time, I felt a tap on my back, I screamed and
turned around, It was Drake. "Hello, what are you doing here so
early?" Drake asked. "I came here to talk to you," I said. I
told him about what the owner of the house had said, he laughed, and told me that
was not true. I left with a frown, and went to talk to the owner. I told him
that Drake was still alive, and he said, "Odd, that man died in his house
and his family buried him." I got really scared, but decided not to tell
anyone else. That same night, I saw the man's ghost. I screamed and, then told
him, get out, I don't need you here, please, get out. He disappeared, and I
never saw him again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Hi a few
stories from </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Australia</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">. I am a
Catholic priest here are my stories.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I come
from a spiritual family who seem to have much contact with the spiritual world.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">My grandma
continually reported that she was visited by a young girl aged 6 for many
years. The girl would disappear when you drew closer. She would appear
regularly and never made you feel frightened. Others reported seeing her from
time to time. My grandmother always believed it was the ghost of her deceased
child Thelma who died about that age from food poisoning.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">About a
week before my grandmother died she told everyone that she had been visited by
the little girl in the white dress and it was her youngest sister who died at a
young age. This time the girl had said everything will be fine. My grandmother
died suddenly in her sleep a week later. The young girl has not been seen
since.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">When I was
preparing for the seminary I lived in a house which was a former convent. After
a few months there we could tell it had a history beyond being a convent. Often
we would be all sitting watching tv when we would hear light switches being
turned on and off. Sometimes the lights were on, sometimes not. Often during
the middle of the night we would hear what sounded like someone walking across
the roof but if you went outside to look there was no one there. Another
experience was someone was lying in bed when the bed went down as if someone
was sitting on the bed. The room became misty and my friend spoke to the spirit
and told them we would help. Finally the house had a verandah and often you
would hear the sound of someone walking it but there was no one there when you
looked.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">We called
a priest who deals in exorcisms and psychic phenomenon who advised us to
research the history of the place. The house had a very checked past. It was
originally owned and built by a very stern man who had two daughters who never
married. The house then became a convent where it was used as a house for
unmarried mothers. Many children had also died on the premises. It appeared
that the noises were consistent with childlike behaviour switching lights off
and on even walking across the roof.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">We followed
the Catholic ritual named the persons and invited then to move on&#8230;.they did.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">There are
also evil experiences. My parents house became very cold after the death of my
grandmother. The front room was the coldest and had a smell of roses. My mother
always thought it was the spirit of her father as he had a great love of roses.
We called in a friend who was a priest who dealt with spiritual matters.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">He asked
whether any s&eacute;ances, Ouji boards or anything had occurred in the house. They
had not and the house was not that old. My mother remembered some strange cards
she had seen when packing up my grandmother&#8217;s things. She went to get them from
under the house to discover they were missing from the place she last saw them.
What she found in there place was a empty packet with burn marks. After our
priest friend left we searched for these cards.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">After some
time the cards were found they were Tarot cards found among my mother&#8217;s
personal items. How they got there we still do not understand as no one had
been under the house since moving my grandmother&#8217;s items. Out of fear we
decided to burn these cards. We lit a fire grabbed some BBQ tongs and put each
card on the fire. The frightening part was everytime we would place a card on
the fire with the tongs a large blue flame would try to reach our arm. We
prayed the Our Father throughtout this time and prayed for God&#8217;s protection.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Within a
few weeks the house was warm again&#8230;..<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Be careful
of the evil side of the spiritual world&#8230;..it does exist.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I've told
this story numerous times, and every time i tell it i get this <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">really bad
feeling, like i should keep my mouth shut. But i really need to <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">tell it,
it freaks me out really bad and im desperate as to what i'm seeing. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">when i was
in 8th grade (i'm now a senior in high school) i saw this "thing" <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">in my
room. it was halloween and my parents wouldn't let me go <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">trick-or-treating.
so, as any kid my age would do, i got pissed off and <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">stormed up
to my room. i layed on my bed and started tossing a ball up into <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">the air.
about an hour later i had calmed down (yes i know, i need anger <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">management)
but as i felt better, i accidently threw the ball too hard and <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">hit the
ceiling. it bounced off and rolled over to the corner. i flipped <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">over onto
my stomach and looked to see where the ball had gone. instead of <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">seeing my
ball, there was a man facing the corner of my room. he looked like <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">he might
of been homeless...but there was just something off about him. i <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">couldn't
see his face...he wouldn't turn around. this freaked me out more <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">than
anything, and i let it be known. i screamed and as i backed away the <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">apparitiion
dissapeared. i didn't see him again until two years later. i was <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">talking on
the phone with my then girlfriend. my cousin was fast asleep on <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">my floor
seeing as it was about 2 in the morning. i was talkin with my gf <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">when i
just happened to look out the window, and to my horror and <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">astonishment
there he was again, IN my window. still with his back to me. i <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">hung up
the phone and yelled at my cousin to wake up, he stirred and saw <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">just what
i did. at this point i should clarify...seeing a guy in your <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">window is
scary enough, but when your bedroom is on the second floor, it <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">tends to
be worse. so me and my cousin bolted downstairs and stayed in the <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">living
room the rest of the night. nothing happened again until two years <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">later,
which was two weeks ago. im talking to my gf now (yes i know it <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">sounds
bad, but it was two years ago with that other chick) and again im <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">laying on
my bed with my arm outstretched. i suddenly feel this hot breath <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">on my arm
and i start panicking as i hear footsteps go towards the foot of <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">my bed. i
tell my gf i'll call her back, and hang up promptly. i closed my <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">eyes and
prayed the damned thing would go away. i never felt anything, and <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">was so
freaked out i took some tylenol pm so i could sleep. that night i <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">dreamt. i
dreamt that i could see my body in my own bed, but i wasn't alone <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">in my
room. a man came into my room, completly concealed in shadow. he made <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">his way to
my bed and slowly started to reach out for me...i immediatly woke <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">up. but
even as i did, i could still see him. i jumped outta bed and grabbed <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">my
baseball bat. i started swinging at the area he was in, but hit nothing <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">but air. i
did, however, manage to break my lamp and a little bit of my <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">window.
but he was still there, up until i turned on my main light. like <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">that he
was gone. this happened two weeks ago and im scared that this will <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">continue
to get worse. if anyone has had a similar thing happen to them, by <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">From 1988
- 1991 I was an Assistant Manager for Mann Theaters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In 2000, this theatre was torn down and now a
Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond is in it's place.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I personally don't know if that store is experiencing any problems, but
there were problems from the movie theatre.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When I go inside the store, I do feel weird sensations about
"something" still being there.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I wanted to ask the employees if they've experienced anything, but
haven't had the guts to do it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Last year
I sent you an email explaining this, and I still haven't seen anything on your
website so I thought I would mention it again.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>These are my personal experiences which other employees also have
experienced.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Most of
the activity was located in the projection booth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, the haunting are believed to come
from theatre 5 where it was said a person had a heart attack and died while
watching a movie.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that theatre, while
employees were cleaning between shows, we would hear the seats squeak as if
someone was sitting down or standing up, hear loud noises out side of the exit
doors only for the noise to stop as we are opening the door to find nothing
outside.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">In the
booth, I have looked several time up to the booth from any of the theatres to
see a silhouette of a person starring down at me through the port hole, knowing
that I'm the only one with a key and the projectionists for that day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have been up there several times (as well
as with others) to see a person run across the booth out of the corner of our
eyes only to find no one there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have
had footsteps walk right up behind me (I was thinking someone was trying to
sneak up on me), I would turn around and no one would be there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A movie reel has rolled across the floor and
stop in the middle of the hallway.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">The thing
that freaked me out the most was when I was looking out a port hole from inside
the booth (cold air from the theatre will rush in like a fan blowing in your
face), a brush of hot air overpowered the air coming in and went out the port
hole.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>About 5 seconds later the air from
the theatre starting blowing in again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">We (myself
and other employees) were used to things happening all of the time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We also tried using a Ougie board in theatre
5 and it freaked out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was going
nuts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We stopped and went back out into
the main lobby.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">No one
ever knew for sure who the ghost was.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I have
several stories...<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">some are Indian
Tales, that I have seen with my own two eyes...<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>some are stories I have heard from my best friend.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">there is a
great one that my daughter experienced.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">if you
think I may have something to help email me back...<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">* the
experience my daughter had was an odd church that she had skipped first hour to
go see.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was broad daylight out but
you still could not see inside the church.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Upon opening the door of the church you could here children laughing,
eerily... yet no one was inside the church.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The church was dark inside, no light shined through the windows... my
daughter of course ran back to the car and her friends told her that the one
who opens the door must be the one to close it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is a church that all the local people fear to go in... due to the stories
the elders have told....<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">*I myself
have seen floating orbs... these are shapeshifters, the elders will tell
you.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They float up and down the road
between two rows of Indian homes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
story behind the orbs is that they are Kolons... shapeshifters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They take the lives of those who do bad
medicine to others.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I use to have a tape
on them but loaned it out and never got it back... I possibly could get
another.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I have
more but see what you may be interested in and let me know... by the way I love
your website and visit it often....<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Well im
going to leave my name blank but the only thing that ive ever seen (aside from
a few flashes of light and some flying spheres) is a little girl whom used to
climb my steps. This might sound insane, but i didnt belive it untill i seen it
during the day time with people up and walking in my house (my family) i seen
something move (at this time i thought that i was just seeing things) i went to
look (being that i have no door on my room i have a curtan type thing) i looked
through one of the cracks in it. i thought that i had seen somthing down the
stairs and focused my eyes out to look then i realized it was right infront of
me, when i focused in i could see her with extreem deital. I was frozen with
fear i could see she was waring a white dress that was soaked in some pink
fluid other than that she looked normal then she faded away. Ive never seen her
again and dont want to. I dont know what it was and dont much care just want to
be left alone by it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">My family
owns several acres of land in Benzie County, Michigan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our land is adjacent to an ancient cemetery,
with grave stones dating back to the 1800's.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If you walk through the woods you will come upon the cemetery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">One night,
when I was about 12 years old, my sister and I went to bed in the pop-up camper
we were camping in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My parents were
still sitting out by the campfire, which was about 10 feet away from the
camper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I fell asleep easily enough, but
was soon awoken by foot steps circling the camper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I called out for my mom and dad, but no one
answered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The footsteps kept going
around and around and around the camper.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I searched for a flashlight, but couldn't find one, so I just kept
calling out for my dad.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Eventually, I
fell asleep uneasily to the sound of footsteps continuously going around the
camper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">The next
morning, my sister told me about waking up and seeing a woman looking at her,
very close to her face.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The woman was
pale, with stringy black hair hanging down.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She looked very sad.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I assume
this woman that my sister saw had some connection with the footsteps I heard,
but I don't know.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, this was not
the first nor the last unusual thing to occur here.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

publish this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It happend to my husband and I when we in High
School at Shady Grove High in Rosedale<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Louisiana.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rumor had it that if you went down the gravel
road which led into the SP swamp many miles, after you<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">went over
the railroad tracks, you would come to a large iron<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">gate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You would have to get out of your car to open
the gate and drive into the swamp.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>THE
railroad was deserted by<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">that time,
but a conductor had been decapitated by the train<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">which was
coupling its cars at the time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is
a light at<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">the end of
the swamp road as far as you can see. This is supposed to be the conductor
trying to find his head.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">It is a
large orb which grows larger and more orange as it<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">approaches
your car.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My husband and I saw it, and
our car<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">was parked
on the other side of the gate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were
walking down the road.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the light
came toward us we turned and ran and climbed over the gate,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I will never forget the terror of that
night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We reached our car, turned around
and<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">sqealed
tires getting out of there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We did not

ticking, and kept perfect time for the rest of the time we lived in the

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">IS THE

BOY THAT WAS ABOUT THREE AT THE TIME WOULD GET UP AT NIGHT AND SPREAD ALL OF
HIS COLORING BOOKS OUT ON THE BED. HE WOULD POINT TO HIS COLORING BOOKS AND
TALK OVER HIS SHOULDER AS TO LOOK IN THE CLOSET. THIS WENT ON FOR A FEW NIGHTS
UNTIL HIS MOTHER ASKED HIM WHAT HE WAS DOING . HE TOLD HIS MOTHER THAT HE WAS
SHOWING JULIE HIS BOOKS. WHEN HIS MOTHER ASKED HIM WHO JULIE WAS, HE SAID YOU
KNOW MOMMY SHE IS THE LADY THAT LIVES IN THE CLOSET.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>AFTER SOME INVESTIGATION WE FOUND OUT
THAT<span style="">&nbsp; </span>THERE WAS A LADY THAT WAS AN ARTIST
THAT DIED<span style="">&nbsp; </span>IN THE HOUSE OF NATURAL
CAUSES.. IN THE HALF THAT WE LIVED IN WE WOULD HEAR LOUD FOOT STEPS IN THE
BEDROOM<span style="">&nbsp; </span>THAT WOULD GO INTO THE CLOSET.
OUR SMALL DOG WOULD CHASE THEM ALL THE WAY ACROSS THE ROOM. WE SOLD THE HOUSE
IN 1977. WE HAVE NOT HEARD FROM THE NEW OWNERS AS TO WHAT THEY MAY HAVE GONE

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I was a
young teenager when this event took place. Several months prior to the
"dreams" our family had been misplaced. We were basically homeless
and living with a less than favored aunt. It was while looking at residences
that I had the chance to see the inside of a home that, for years had been a
curiosity to me. As a child my school bus would pass by this home twice a day.
Every morning and afternoon, I would crane my neck to stare at the stately home
atop the hill. I knew that it was a very old home but not much beyond that. To
me, it was the most beautiful and scary place I had seen and the desire to go
inside of it grew greater as the years passed by. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">On the
morning in question, my family and I had appointments with the realtor to see
several homes through out the county. This house of my curiosity was to be our
first stop. I could not wait. As we drove up the drive, I was a bit
disheartened to see that a cousin and uncle were at the home waiting on us.
This cousin in particular was a few years older than I and in my opinion of
very low moral character. We had nothing in common other than blood as far as I
was concerned. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Despite my
earlier apprehension, she was quite respectful and the home was beyond what I
had imagined it to be. This cousin and I gawked our way through the home taking
in each room as if it were a first breath. It was wonderful. The home was so
sensibly laid out and the rooms were so warm, I felt like I was home. My cousin
had mentioned that the house "clicked" for her though I found that to
be a bit surprising given its detail to taste and her lack there of. As for me,
it felt like home and was everything I had dreamed that my future home would
be. I hated to leave and remember longing to go back in as we were driving down
the drive way to the other homes on our schedule. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">That
night, my family and I were heatedly discussing our options. My father and I
were sold on the first house while my mother hated it. My younger siblings did
not seem to care one way or the other. After many hours of discussing and
citing the positives and negatives of all the homes we had seen, I retired to
bed. That night, I had the most horrific and vivid nightmare that I ever
remembered. It was about the home and had my cousin in it. We were in what I
would consider "period" clothing dating back to the late 1800's. I
will not go into all of the details other than to say I witnessed a death in my
dream that was so real, I awoke to my own screams and tears. Several days
passed and each night, the dream returned just as vivid and horrifying as the
night before. On Sunday, as the family gathered for Sunday dinner, I saw my
cousin sitting alone under a large oak tree. She looked very haggard and I
approached her. Now she and I had never been close and truth be told, friendly
would not be an apt description either. But still, I approached her and asked
her what was wrong. She began telling me of this horrible nightmare that was
haunting her and I sat in stunned silence as she recalled detail for detail the
same nightmare that was haunting me. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Since
then, she and I have had the same dreams on several occasions. And though I
still find her to be of low moral character, we have established quite a bond
thanks to the nightmares that we often experience on the same nights with the
exact same details. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">English
Park Condominiums #107 was *my* first place.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There were quite a few creaks and noises that I noticed from my first
day, but I accepted them and grew accustomed to them, never thinking of them as
any more than &#8220;condo noises.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However,
the first visitor (or resident) I noticed in my new home was a man I believed
to be my paternal grandfather.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He would
stand in my bedroom doorway while I or my friends were in the living room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I thought it was my imagination until other
people started pointing him out, the first person being my friend, Rachael.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Rachael
was also the first person to point out &#8220;The Pacer.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While watching TV on night, she said in a
very startled voice, &#8220;Wendy, someone just walked through your kitchen!&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I looked into my kitchen (the doorway and
pass-through making the whole kitchen visible) and saw nothing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Usually, I am very sensitive to other
presences, and I didn&#8217;t even feel anything.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I told her she was crazy, and to lay off of whatever she was on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, a few nights later, at around 10:30pm, I
saw a man pace once through my small kitchen.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He almost seemed like he was in a hurry, or a panic, or simply really
worried about something.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had an
urgent air about him. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Shocked, I called
Rachael and told her I saw him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">A few
weeks after that, a similar thing happened.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Rachael and I were sitting in my living room watching TV (with Grandpa
looking on), when Rachael exclaimed that a cat had just ran through my living
room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Slightly annoyed, I told her I
don&#8217;t have a cat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, I didn&#8217;t believe
her when she tried to explain the &#8220;ghost cat.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Actually,
it was quite a few months before I saw it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It appeared under my foot as I was walking into the living room, and I
almost fell trying to avoid it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It ran
off down the hall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I figured I was
losing it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">About a
year and a half later, my fianc&eacute; moved in with me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I never mentioned any of this to him in fear
he would have me committed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, he soon
learned for himself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the third night
that he officially lived with me, he was awoken in the middle of the night by a
feeling that he couldn&#8217;t breathe.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
said there was a man standing at the foot of the bed, on my side.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Without making a sound, the man seemed to
warn him from doing me any harm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once my
fianc&eacute; silently assured him no harm would come to me, the man seemed to give
him a warm, accepting feeling, and then was gone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My fianc&eacute; immediately woke me up and told me
about what had just happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I calmed
him down and told him the man was just my grandfather trying to look out for
me, as he had all the time I had lived there.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Half jokingly, he asked if there were any other spirits in the home he
should know about, so I told him about &#8220;The Pacer&#8221; and &#8220;ghost cat.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I didn&#8217;t get into details, I figured that
could wait.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Evidently,
I waited too long.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was making
rice-krispy treats one night, a few months later, while Jon (my fianc&eacute;) was on
the computer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The computer desk was in
the living room, next to the hallway, and facing the bedroom door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I could see Jon from the kitchen through the
pass-through.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While I was stirring the
marshmallows, I saw Jon look over, into the bedroom with a concerned look on
his face, and rush into the bedroom.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Curious, I went over to see what he was doing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I looked into the bedroom from the
doorway, I just saw Jon appear to be looking for something.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unconcerned, I went back into the kitchen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A few moments later, Jon came out and asked,
&#8220;Did you see that?&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;Did I see
what?&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I asked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;Someone just walked through the
bedroom!&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>he said.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s just &#8216;The Pacer.&#8217;&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I told him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Now, Jon was very concerned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
didn&#8217;t understand what the heck was going on.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>&#8220;I told you about him, remember?&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I asked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;Yeah,&#8221; he replied &#8220;but
I didn&#8217;t believe you!&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That&#8217;s about the
time I realized that just before &#8220;The Pacer&#8221; would make his brief appearance, a
high-pitched whistle could be heard throughout the condo through the AC
vents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This would always occur around
10:30pm on the nights I was there (I worked part-time at night).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I never was able to figure out why he paced,
what he was waiting for.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Clearly, he was
distressed by something, but never bothered anyone else.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">If you
have any questions or comments for me, or would like to hear about &#8220;Arthur&#8221;, please

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">At a
personal residence in Chelsea Estates, across from the National Guard off of
rt. 141, there is an older man and two little girls who haunt the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The man is only seen to be "half of a
body" and wears a black suit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
two little girls are between the ages of 6-10.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>One of the little girls has shoulder length, light curly hair, and wears
a light colored nightgown/dress.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
little girls are usually heard laughing, singing, and playing in the
hallway.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They also like to randomly turn
on a radio in the kitchen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They are nice
ghosts, moe protectors than anything, but at the same time very creepy!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My husband and I were good friends with the
couple that used to live there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
have since been divorced and have moved, but they say that the ghosts moved
with them when they lived in an apartment in Middletown, DE.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The ghosts made their "residence"
with them in Chelsea.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although, the
adults can only hear the little girls, the little girl, who is the daughter of
the couple who lived there, had an imaginary friend.....one of the ghosts!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She would talk to her and tell her mother
what the ghost said!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She could also see
the ghosts!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a personal experience, my
husband and I babysat the couple's daughter, she was 8 at the time, and the
couple's son, he was 5 at the time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
babysat for a weekend while the couple was away at a fireman's convention, just
so happens that both were members of Christiana Fire Co.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>mostly working out of Station 3 (the one
mentioned as haunted).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first night
we stayed we had no problems.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Saturday,
day, the daughter and I had to go back to the house because she needed a
jacket, we were at a high school football game.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When we entered the house, the kitchen radio was on, and the Barbie car
the daughter was playing with earlier in the morning had a radio that was also
on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither one of these items were on
when we left the house earlier that day!<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In fact, the radio station that was on the Barbie car was a local pop
station when the daughter was playing with it earlier in the morning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When we returned to get the jacket, the radio
station was a local television station that broadcasts in the very low FM
numbers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No big deal, we turned them off
not knowing of the possiblity of "hauntings" in the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Much later that night, while the kids were
asleep and my husband and I were asleep in the couple's bedroom, things got
REALLY weird.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I usually have to sleep
with covers, but for some reason that night my husband and I fell asleep on top
of the covers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All we had to cover up
the two of us was a small throw blanket, but all night long I had a strange
sensation, like someone was looking over me, keeping my uncovered back
warm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My side of the bed was closest to
the door (the rooms in Chelsea are not very big at all), and my husband was
facing the wall that faces Rt. 141.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sometime
around </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="4"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">4am</span></st1:time><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">, my
husband turned from the wall to "cuddle up" to me, facing the
door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As he moved he saw a
"figure" standing at the foot of the bed "hovering" over
me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For a moment he thought that it was
the little girl that we were babysitting, but she seemed to be floating and the
door was still closed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The longer he
looked at the bright, hovering girl, the more he realized that the girl that we
were babysitting did not have curly hair, nor did she go to sleep in a
nightgown. She was looking at us, probably trying to figure out who the strange
people were sleeping in the home owners' bed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Startled and confused my husband got out of bed, walked about 2 feet to
the bathroom (right next to the hovering figure), all the while the little girl
watching him, and turned on the bathroom light.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Immediately, the hovering figure disappeared.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Still confused, we checked on both the boy
and the girl that we were babysitting.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Both of them were sound asleep in their beds!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The next morning we didn't say anything to
the children, but as soon as the parents returned we aksed them if their house
was haunted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They responded by saying,
"Which ghost did you see?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The man
or the little girls?"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My husband
and I ran out of the house screaming with our hair standing on end!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Needless to say, our speculation was true and
they preceeded to tell us about other hauntings that they had been witness to
in their house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Had we known this prior
to babysitting that weekend, we would have brought the children to our
house!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because I worked with the woman
who owned the house, and her children went to the same school that I teach at,
I later asked the daughter about her imaginary friend.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was still unaware about my husband's
"sighting".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She described the
"hovering figure" exactly as my husband had said!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once again, my hair was standing on end!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Other stories include the "half
man" making loud footsteps/banging across the second floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ironically, the second floor in that home is
an unfinished attic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No one lived up there,
I guess, except for the ghosts!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The home
owners could not figure out where the very loud, late night banging was coming
from.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They thought someone was knocking
on their front door, running away, and then continuing to knock.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Each time they checked outside and around the
house, but to find no one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon
returning to bed for the last time, the banging footsteps continued and would
not give up on keeping the couple awake.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As the couple got out of bed, the footsteps moved across the second
floor, leading the couple to the kitchen.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While the couple was in the kitchen, the footsteps got louder above a
cabinet in the corner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A cabinet that
housed the hotwater heater.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On top of
the hotwater heater was a cardboard box, a cardboard box that was currently
smoking from some sort of electrical fire.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Once the couple opened the cabinet and saw the smoking box, the
footsteps stopped!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The ghost was trying
to let the couple know that their house was about to catch on fire and was
relentless with the footsteps.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again,
these are only a few stories of the many that the home owners, their children,
and houseguests have encountered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I hope
that you can add these to the list of hauntings in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Delaware</span></st1:place></st1:State><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">The
Wentworth Hotel has had several guests and staff spooked over the years. Guests
hav seen a farmer in the old Wildwood building, which is empty now. In the inn,
when I first started, I went to the attic late at night to get printer paper
for the night audit. The only other person in the inn was the night watchman,
who was washing dishes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While I was up
in the attic, a man asked me what I was looking for. I trned, thinking it was
the night watchman and I was alone. I ran all the way downstairs and out the
kithen door only to bump into the night watchman. He listened to me and agreed
it was a ghost. A few times he and I would be the only ones there and we would
hear strange noises, or sense someone else there. The last time I experienced
something strange, I saw a coworker walking along Wildwood and I got out of my
car and tried to sneak up behind him. When I rounded the corner, there was no
one there!<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I work
days now. It is not for this reason but I am still glad that someone else can
enjoy the ghosts.I would prefer not to list my name, as I still work there and
I don't want to scare the new staf<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Jessica Rayley and I am now 18 years old.<span style="">&nbsp;

  Street</span></st1:address></st1:Street><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It's an old dirt road that curves quite a bit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When you first turn onto it, you get an
aerie, spike-tingling feeling of a negative energy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You go over an old bridge and curve to the
right.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>About 300 yards up you curve to
the left.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the middle of this 300 yard
stretch, you can look up and see an old house on top of a hill. It has been
said that if you go down the street that leads to the house, you can see an old
woman in an orange rocking chair looking out of the window, and when you get to
the front of the house, she'll be at another window. The street goes up around
a small circle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There are a lot of
run-down houses where almost everyone in this neighborhood picked-up and moved
out almost all at the same time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There
is a house next to the circle that always catches on fire.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>People would move in, it would burn, they
would move out, new people would move in, it would burn down, etc.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This went on and on for quite some time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has been said that in the center of the
circle was once a Satanist church.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You
can still see bricks from the building that was once there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I lived diagonally across from the house that
constantly burned down.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At one time, I
was left home alone, my parents thinking I would be fine since we were in the
middle of nowhere while they went out to dance on their anniversary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was sitting in the living room watching TV
when I saw a shadowy black figure peer around the corner of the hallway.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I remember thinking it was my imagination and
closing my eyes hoping it would disappear.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I then heard my dog start barking and I opened my eyes to see two
shadowy figures.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I instantly jumped
behind the chair I was sitting in and began rocking back and forth on the
floor, crying until my parents got home.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I was so frightened that I peed myself.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When my parents got home, I instantly screamed for them to come to
me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They didn't seem very concerned,
until my dad went to look in my bedroom to find a hole busted through my window
from a rock thrown, but the hole was much too small for a body to fit
through.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I recently asked my parents if
it was a dream I had as a child, and they assured me that it was real.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We also had a lot of animals die there, most
being dogs that died standing up with the impression of being scared "to
death," others hanging themselves from my porch, and others dying from
mysterious, unexplainable deaths.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
remember hearing a story about an Indian burial ground in the woods surrounding
the Satanist church.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This concerned my
mother quite a bit, but my father didn't seem to have any worries, until one
certain day when My pet turtle had died (from an unexplainable death).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My father and I were digging a hole to bury
my pet in when we hit what seemed like rocks.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My father took a closer look, and it seemed to be the skeleton of a
small child.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Stories suggested that it
could have been a sacrifice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Needless to
say, we moved away within the next few days.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I went back recently to take a visit, and I took my best friend along
with me, who has quite an interest in ghosts and paranormal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She instantly began to talk about how
uncomfortable she felt, and how she wanted to leave immediately.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My friend and I came upon this site looking
for information about the </span><st1:Street><st1:address><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Lynderboro
  Street</span></st1:address></st1:Street><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> hauntings, but seemed to find
nothing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hopefully the information I
gave you will give you the urge to look more in depth to this situation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Below I have drawn a sketch of the street,
and my old house so you can get a better feel for it<o:p></o:p></span></p>

house that my older<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">and
younger brothers and myself were basically raised in. For years many<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">strange
things have happened in this house I would like to detail a few<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">of them
and a personal experience in which my life was saved by a ghost.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">My older
brother John was 7 years older than myself. When he was 16<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">years old
which would be 1973 in the summer he had an account of<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">something
out of the ordinary. He stayed up late one night watching TV.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">When he
went to bed his bed was downstairs off of the main living room<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">in the
back corner of the house. He said that he was just dozing off<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">when he
could hear what sounded like labored breathing from all around<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">the room
(as if the walls were breathing). He said at first it was<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">fairly
faint and he discarded it as the wind blowing (The house was<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">built in
1929 and is drafty). What made him realize that it wasn't the<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">wind was
that it never lost cadence as if someone was struggling to<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">breath in
then breathing out. After about 5 minutes the breathing<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">increased
in volume and continued to increase until my brother was so<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">afraid
that he ran upstairs to my Mom and Dad's room and slept in a<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">chair
until the next morning where my Mom awoke to see him. She said he<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">was ashen
white and told her once about what happened and never<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">mentioned
another word about it until I was leaving to join the service.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">It was
only at this time that he asked me if anything strange had<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">happened
to me during my life in the house. I relayed my stories and he<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">told me
that he had researched it and the original owner had a daughter<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">that died
from Pneumonia in that very back bedroom in 1934. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Over the
years our whole family did move around to various rooms in the<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">house as
our bedrooms. The upstairs has an attic which adjoins to one<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">bedroom
(originally my Mom and Dad's and mine for a short time). A<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">smaller
bedroom off to the side of that (originally my younger brother<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">and I
shared that.) A hall off of the master bedroom with a staircase to<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">the
downstairs level. When we were young and went to bed upstairs almost<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">every
night you could here the creaking pattern of the stairs as if<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">someone
was coming up and going down the stairs and no one was there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">About 1974
my Father made an in-law apartment out of the basement for my<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Grandmother
on my mother's side. She stayed with us for a couple of<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">years
until our elderly neighbor passed away and my father bought the<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">house next
door and my grandmother moved in there. After that my Dad and<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Mom
decided that we would make the basement our living area during the<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">hot
summers to save on electric costs. From 1976 until I left home in<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">1985 you
could sit in the basement and hear footsteps go across the<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">house and
you knew no one was up there. During this time also if you<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">went
upstairs it would not be unusual for lights that were off earlier<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">to be on. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">In 1981
When my brother moved out for the last time I took the front<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">bedroom in
what I will now call the regular downstairs (not the<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">basement).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In 1983 I had been dating a girl for about a
year and a<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">half. We
were quite serious. We had pictures taken of just the 2 of us<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">and I had
just put a 5x7 framed on my night stand. Anyway I came home<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">that night
from her place and after watching some TV I went to bed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">During the
night I slept sporadically feeling uneasy as if someone was<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">watching
me. Now I've had this feeling before in the house and had just<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">learned to
live with it. When I did get up the next morning my new<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">picture
was laying face down and the glass was cracked (not shattered<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">down the
length of my girlfriends body and face in the picture). Yet I<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">didn't
hear anyone come into my room during the night and the nightstand<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">was on the
opposite side from any window in the room. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">This last
incident did not happen in the family home. February 1993 my<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">mother
passed away from complications from open heart surgery. This was<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">a very
long ordeal which started in December of 1992. She was in<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">intensive
care for 6 weeks at times in a drug induced coma due to her<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">emphysema
and not be able to get her off the ventilator. I spent 4 weeks<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">of
emergency leave there with my Dad on a 24/7 vigil. My mother started<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">getting
better and I went back to </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Ct.</span></st1:place></st1:State><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> to my
wife and 2 daughters. About<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">2 weeks
later she had been taken out of intensive care and was put into<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">a
rehabilitation center to help strengthen her lungs to get off the<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">ventilator.
We payed a short visit in early February. That was the last<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">time I saw
her alive. One week later she died suddenly. It came as a<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">total
shock. We went home and mourned her death. Especially myself (my<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">mother and
I were very close). A couple of days after the funeral my<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">older
brother convinced me to go ice fish with him. This had been an<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">extremely
cold year and my brother new a farm pond where we could make a<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">haul of
bluegill. It did make me feel better to be out in the country.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">My brother
and I tied off a rope to each other and to a tree onshore<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">just in
case. After about an hour at my hole and my brother about 50 or<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">60 feet away
I notice water pooling around my hole and the bucket I was<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">sitting
on. I knew this was a bad sign. I carefully got up and took 2<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">steps and
the next thing I knew water was over my head. I went through,<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">my brother
panicked and so did I. I was in 4 layers of clothes including<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">insulated
coverall and insulated boots so I was just about as buoyant as<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">a rock. I
scrambled and grabbed the edge of the ice but every time I<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">would try
to pull myself up the ice would break. It wasn't looking good.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Then I
could hear my Mom's voice saying it was ok it wasn't my time yet.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">It felt as
if 2 hands were under me holding me up. I became very calm<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">and told
my brother who by this time had manage to anchor himself with<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">his foot
in his hole to pull the rope and slide me out which he did. We<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">quickly
got off the pond and got me into his truck to keep hypothermia<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">from being
any worse. On the way home he said that military training had<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">served me
well being so calm. I told him it wasn't the military but that<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Mom was
with me and told me it was going to be ok. He looked at me and<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">just
quietly said that's funny she told me to put my foot in the hole so<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I could
pull you out.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Jims
bedroom light pops on by itself, plus his blinds have opened up by themselves.
then the other night we had friends over and the door to the middle bedroom
unlatched and opened, when we investigated the door was still locked ! And then
the other day we were doing some cleaning, I was in the front room which is our
parlour, and Jim was cleaning the kitchen, our other roommate was cleaning the
back bathroom, which is off from the Kitchen, when she screamed and came
running out of the bathroom, we calmed her down and she told us what happened,
it sounded like a womans voice, she said " What are you doing?"<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Marissa
saw a woman standing near the door , thats when she screamed and ran from the
room. she was the same one seen by Jim in the mirror, with the 1930's style
clothing. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">We all
left the house for a couple of hours and calmed down. So I decided to
investigate what really happened here at the </span><st1:Street><st1:address><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">2nd street</span></st1:address></st1:Street><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> house.
Apparently back in the 1920's there was a small house located exactly where out
rose garden is now,( It later burned to the ground) , well when that house was
built, a happy newlywed couple moved in there, while they were having a sunday
picnic, the girl was running to get something that fell near the creek bank,
when she slipped and fell hitting her head she died.. the husband lived in the
house until it burned and then he moved on, but I talked with his elderly
sister, and he said he was always haunted by the ghost of his young wife, he
wasnt afraid because he truly loved her, but even he was spooked, so the
current house was built here in the late 30's early 40's, it was a series of
additions. but our landlady has told us of strange occurences, she was never
bothere by the spirit, we rent either but it is still strange to wonder why
this woman is still hanging around the place, 80 years after she passed away.
Who knows but I had to share this tale. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">When I was
about 10 years old my family rented a house in Oskaloosa, Ks.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This is a small town that has a population
of about 1074.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We moved in the summer of
1992 or '93. Oskaloosa has a lake and this is where I would spend most of my
days fishing mostly because I did not like spending time in the house that my
family had moved to because it was haunted.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was haunted by an older man that only I could see.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first time I noticed that something
strange was going on was when I was laying in my bed trying to go to
sleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I thought I saw my dad look into
my bedroom than he just went back out without saying anything.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I thought it was weird so I opened my door
and asked him what he wanted (the only way to get to my bedrroom was through my
parents room.) My dad said that he had not come into my room and told me to go
back to bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I didn't really know what
was going on but I soon found out.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Another night not long after, I was laying in my bed again trying to go
to sleep when I heard a man's voice say "Get out" <span style="">&nbsp;</span>when I looked up I saw an angry old man at the
foot of my bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was very scared after
this happened and I kept telling my parents about the man that I saw but no one
else in my family could ever see what I could.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Then one day my mom, sister, brother, and I were in the livingroom
watching TV<span style="">&nbsp; </span>when I saw the man going
toward my brother.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I yelled at my mom
and told her that I saw the man going toward my brother and I knew that he was
going to hurt him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I saw the man
get to my brother my brother stared yelling that his back was hurting but still
no one else could see what I saw.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My mom
went over to my brother and more to humor me than anything she put out her hand
to smack the invisible hands away from my brother, but she was shocked when she
felt her hand hit something that she could not see.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After that she told as all to get into the
car when we were all in the car getting ready to drive off I saw the old man
circling the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We moved shortly
after that last event and I have not ever had the desire to go back.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">This
incident (actually, a few incidents that are blended together in my memory) has
been on my mind constantly since the time it happened&#8212;when I couldn&#8217;t have been
older than six.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am now thirty and this
is the first time I&#8217;ve written about it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I remember
a lot of nightmares from my childhood, but these experiences were distinctly
different from a dream.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I know because
the sense of panic I get in nightmares always wakes me up, but in these
experiences I had nowhere to escape and had to endure every moment of terror in
full wakefulness.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">The
activity seemed to be centered around the fireplace in the living room of my
childhood home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The echoing clank of
metal in the dark&#8212;like sounds from a boiler room or workshop&#8212;has always been a
&#8220;cue&#8221; for me that something ominous is about to happen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That&#8217;s how a lot of my nightmares began, as
well as my waking experiences with the &#8220;three little devils,&#8221; as I call them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I remember
lying on the living room couch, directly across from the fireplace.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I heard that signature echoing metallic clank
along with gruff, echoing voices, too low to make out what was being said.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The sound was coming from the fireplace,
where I saw three small figures behind the glass pane.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were mumbling among themselves and
looking at me as if they knew everything about me and knew exactly how scared I
was of them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">They were
about two feet tall and had either pointy ears or little horns at the top of
their heads.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were all the same
shape, but one was just bone, one was just muscle (like a skinned animal), and
the third one was hairy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their eyes were
large and entrancing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was literally
paralyzed with fear and couldn&#8217;t even scream.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That&#8217;s about all that happened each episode.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">They
always appeared in the fireplace.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only
once did I see them somewhere else: I was looking out a window onto the street
one night and saw them crossing the street towards me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I could sense that they were aware I could
see them and took pleasure in frightening me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">What was
most eerie was the way they walked in unison.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was as if they were all controlled by a common brain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Each would raise his right foot and slant his
body to the left, then raise the left foot and slant to the right.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They advanced slowly that way, like
marionettes, and completely synchronized in every move.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My mother was in the room with me at the
time, bit I felt that somehow I could not or must not tell her what I saw
outside the window.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">To this
day, whenever I sleep in a room with a fireplace I face away from it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I&#8217;ve read
hundreds of stories from the Shadowlands site to see if anyone has encountered
similar creatures.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No luck so far.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If anyone has, feel free to email me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thanks for you time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">admitting
that was the fact that my brother had seen the same things, but<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">unfortunaly
it just stayed with me. As a little girl my family lived in an<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Old Farm
Stead in </span><st1:place><st1:City><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Guelph</span></st1:City><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> </span><st1:State><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Ontario</span></st1:State><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">, </span><st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Canada</span></st1:country-region></st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">. The
house was built in early<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">1800's,
our bedrooms were all upstairs in the big house, my brother down<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">the hall
and my parents room on the opposite side of the hall. At this time<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I had to
be about 4 years old, my brother michael was 5. Late one night a<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">sound woke
my brother woke up to a wierd noise coming from my room, so of<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">course he
came in to inspect it. When he entered my room he saw me curled<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">up in a
little ball shaking and rocking back and forth with my hands over<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">my face.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Right
above my head there was a dark figure circling over my head, and my<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">curtains
whipping back and forth eventhough my window was closed, and the<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">figure
above my head kept reaching towards me. Michael ran to my parents<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">room for
help but when they arrived they couldn't see anything although it<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">did not go
away, so they put me in my brothers room so I can sleep. This<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">continued
for 3 years while living on that farm.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Then we
moved to </span><st1:place><st1:City><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Santa Rosa</span></st1:City><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> </span><st1:State><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">California</span></st1:State></st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">, and it
still continued to follow<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">me, except
now it was starting to take shape. It's in the shape of a man, a<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">very dark
skinned man, whome after a time I called stew, which is the name<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">it gave
me, I asked my parents if they new of a dark skinned man by the<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">name of
stew or stewart, my father did, his best friend had been found<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">murdered
and stuffed into a trunk of an old car in a junk yard, at last! a<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I know who
it is.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Then we
moved again, this time to </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">West Virginia</span></st1:place></st1:State><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">, and it
got ugly. We moved<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">into an
old plantation farm house that used to have slaves to run the farm.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">This is
where stew got aggressive, I was coming down the stairs one night<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">to watch
the saturday night movie with my parents and brother and I saw<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">imprints
of someone gripping the back of my father's cloth backed chair and<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">as I
screamed it jerked my fathers chair back, if I haden't screamed when I<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">did my
father would never have had time to turn and miss having his neck<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">broken and
the chair slammed down onto a oak table and smashed. I firmly<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">believe it
tried to kill my father.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">From that
night on I moved my bed into my closet so I could pretend I<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">didn't
hear the footsteps walking around my bed, but most nights I would<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">run into
my brothers connecting room and sleep in his room, it tended to<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">leave us,
or mainly me alone when we were in the same room.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Then we
moved again, on my 13th birthday to </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Ontario</span></st1:place></st1:State><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Canada</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">, it
followed<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">again, but
now it only showed up right before something bad was about to<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">happen.
Once while going on my daily walk through the woods and it appeared<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">waving his
arms at a corner that goes towards the pond, I ignored it and<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">continued
on, as I walked around the corner I was jumped by a very large<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">man and
his intent was rape, the good thing was I always walk with a large<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">stick and
managed to get away, losing my shoe in the process. Another time<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">on
Halloween night, I was by myself in the bar where I worked and he<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">appeared
at the front door making motions to run, I again ignored him and<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">continued
on with my reading. A moment later a man walked threw my door and<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">robbed me.
After that I decided to pay attention to stew (my apperation)<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">since he's
never tried to harm me, only my father, for which I have no<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">idea,
maybe there's more to his story then what my father told me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">I'm now
going on 22 in august and to this day stew still visit's me, but<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">now only
when something bad is about to happen. I still have not told Tim<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">(my future
husband) about it, but one day I will, for I truly believe that<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Stew is my
gardian angel. What else could he be?<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">The house
I live in was built about 1907 and was built over an old farm house and
land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When we decided to refurbish the
house, interesting things began to happen, especially when we discovered a room
we did not know even existed!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We decided
to enlarge the master bedroom to incorporate the new found space.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our 12x13 room turned into a 23x13 room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was very excited about having such a large
bedroom and planned to also use the room as my meditation spot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But as we were finishing up the remodeling, I
began to feel very unwelcome and the atmosphere was less than conducive to
meditation, let alone sleep!<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Every time
I would do any work in that room, I could hardly wait to get out of there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My husband was also having difficulties with
the room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He would work on it during the
day while I worked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His radio would
change stations on its own.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now, this is
an old radio with a dial, and the only way it would work is to plug, or unplug
it since the knob was gone, and it would only get one station.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But when the spirit in the room decided it
was time for a change, the radio would change from country/western to rock and
roll!<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One time in the middle of the
night, we were startled awake by the radio blaring a rock song, when my husband
got up to turn it off, thinking he forgot to unplug it, it was already
unplugged!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Let me tell you that made all
the hairs stand up on the back of my neck!<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>His tools would disappear from where he left them, only to return a
while later in the exact spot he left them in.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But only after a frustrating search had taken place.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">We've had
friends over and have had cups fly off the fridge and land across the
kitchen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lights go on and off with a
mind of their own.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our bedroom door
opens and closes in the middle of the night startling us awake thinking someone
is entering our room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have
bangings,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>smells, voices, the sounds of
people walking about upstairs, coming up and down the stairs, our motion
sensing lights in the landing go on when no one is in the landing, toilets
flush when no one is in the bathroom.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And guests have told us that someone jumped on their beds during the
night and articles of clothing have gone missing only to return when asked to
be given back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Electrical gadgets seem
to take on a mind of their own and our camcorder has turned on all by
itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our grandson use to
"play" with a little spirit boy named Jimmy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They would play with those little green army
men in mock battle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Jacob on one end of
the coffee table and Jimmy on the other.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We were amazed to watch Jacob move his men, and then the men at the end
of the table would move as well.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
asked Jacob who he was playing with he said<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"the boy."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When we
asked what boy, he sighed and pointed to the end of the table and stated<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"that boy," rather irritated with
grandma and grandpa that we could not see what was in front of our faces!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Last Christmas we decided to put plastic
Disney characters on the tree since we have two little ones who could break the
family heirloom ones.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were in another
room when Donald Duck came flying through the air past our heads and landed in
the kitchen sink.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We stared at each
other, burst into laughter, and as I put Donald back on the tree, I told Jimmy
that if the grand kids could not throw the ornaments, he couldn't either.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The ornaments were safe the rest of the
season.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Being a
psychic/medium having spirits around isn't all that unusual, and even though I
should be use to it ,on a dark night it can get a little scary at times,
especially when you are all alone.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Amazingly, a few hours, or one night at our home and skeptics leave our
home believers in spirit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All in all its
not a bad place to live, the spirits in our home are friendly, playful, and
comforting.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">- My
parents lived at one time in an apartment in </span><st1:place><st1:City><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Port
  Huron</span></st1:City><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">, </span><st1:State><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Michigan</span></st1:State></st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">It was in
the 800 block of Wall Street. One night my mother woke to a <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">voice,
that kept telling her to turn to the right. She said my father at <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">that time
kept hearing a noise, like someone banging on a metal trash <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">can. My
mother walked out of her bedroom, turning to the right. She <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">noticed
that a thunderstorm was going on outside, and that they had left <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">a fan on
in the window. She turned off the fan and removed it from the <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">window. She
closed the window and went back to bed. She said she didn't <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">hear the
voice again, and that the banging noise my father heard had <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">also
stopped. They found out later from others that an elderly couple <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">had once
lived in the same apartment as they. There had been a fire <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">there, and
the elderly couple had died in it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">- We once
lived in a house in the 1200 block of </span><st1:Street><st1:address><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Chestnut
  St.</span></st1:address></st1:Street><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> in Port <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Huron, </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Michigan</span></st1:place></st1:State><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">. I was
around 12 years old, at the time. I shared a tiny <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">bedroom
with my 2 younger sisters, ages<span style="">&nbsp; </span>around
11 and 8 years. My <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">middle
sister and I slept on bunk cots on one side of the room, and our <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">baby
sister slept in a regular bed on the opposite side of the room. The <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">lights
were out in our room, but you could see light filtering from the <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">living
room through the curtains at our bedroom doorway. I was the only <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">one who
saw a head appear through the doorway curtains, and "float" <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">across the
room to my youngest sister's bed. We had been sitting in our <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">beds and
talking, not yet ready to go to sleep. The head came to a stop, <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">just above
my sister's right shoulder. It's features were human-like, <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">but seemed
either evil or distorted-looking. It never said anything, but <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">looked
straight at me. It seemed as though it was trying to convey to me <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">that
something really bad was going to happen to my sister, and then it <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">disappeared.
I asked my sisters if they had seen anything, but they said <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">they did
not. My sister, as well as the rest of the family has had many <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">sad and
unfortunate things happen through the years, but I don't know if <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">my sister
has had the "really bad" thing happen yet.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">My sister
and I were visiting friends who had renovated an old farmhouse in </span><st1:place><st1:City><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Bogalusa</span></st1:City><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">, </span><st1:State><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">La.</span></st1:State></st1:place><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"><span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was approximately 19 years ago.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That day the host had invited many friends to
celebrate the Kentucky Derby.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was a
fun filled day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That night by sister and
I were given a room in the old part of the house to spend the night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A little after </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="0"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">midnight</span></st1:time><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;"> we both sat up in bed simultaneously, looked at each
other and said, &#8220;did you feel that.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Needless to say we hightailed it out of that room.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">What we
both felt was a coldness, then a sense of evil, is the only way I can explain
it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That&#8217;s what I felt and my sister
said that is what she felt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">We spent
the night in the den.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The next morning
we relayed our story to the host and hostess.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They said they were sorry, they should have told us that an old woman
had died in the old farmhouse, some said she was murdered.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial;">Until that
time I never believed in the supernatural.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But, that night I definitely experienced something.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
