</H3><P>
<P><B>By: Anniekins@netscape.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>We lived in Quincy Illinois in a large, late Victorian brick mansion.
 The</B>
<P><B>previous owner had been an elderly woman who kept foster children in
this</B>
<P><B>large, run-down and out-dated home.  The house had a dirt floor basement,
two</B>
<P><B>stories and a complete third floor attic.  The bedrooms were on the
second</B>
<P><B>floor with the door to the attic facing the door to the bedroom we
regarded as</B>
<P><B>the master bedroom.  We slept in a different bedroom as the master
bedroom</B>
<P><B>needed renovation which we had not yet completed.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The only strange occurrence we experienced did not, at the time, strike
us as</B>
<P><B>unusual.  Whenever we returned home after dark, the lights upstairs
in either</B>
<P><B>the master bedroom or the closet, where my husband kept his clothes,
were</B>
<P><B>turned on.  I accused my husband of leaving them on when he left the
house,</B>
<P><B>however, he had never done this before.  He couldn't remember if he
left</B>
<P><B>lights on or not. When working alone in the house, I had always kept
my dog</B>
<P><B>with me and she never seemed uncomfortable or uneasy in the house or
in this</B>
<P><B>bedroom. </B>
<P>
<P><B>After we moved and sold the house, we received a phone call from the
person</B>
<P><B>who bought the house.  She asked if we experienced any unusual incidents
in</B>
<P><B>the house when we lived there.  She and her husband, it turned out,
were using</B>
<P><B>the master bedroom as their bedroom.  Several times during the night,
they had</B>
<P><B>seen the shadowy outline of an old woman sitting in their rocking chair
and</B>
<P><B>had seen the chair rocking when no one was in it.  They also
experienced</B>
<P><B>pictures being turned to the wall and laid down on their faces.  One
picture</B>
<P><B>was missing and they had been unable to find it.</B>
<P>
<P><B>We suspect they "saw" the original owner of the house, not the owner
we</B>
<P><B>purchased it from, who had been the wife of a rather wealthy merchant.
 She</B>
<P><B>was reported to have taken great pride in the home that her husband
built for</B>
<P><B>her, going to great lengths to insure it was built the way she
wanted,</B>
<P><B>overseeing all minor details such as selecting doorknobs and hardware.
 She</B>
<P><B>was said to spend her leisure time rocking in her rocking chair and
looking</B>
<P><B>out the window. Apparently she remains in her house, watching over
it, to this</B>
<P><B>day.</B>

<P><B>Many Happenings</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: darrell@compufort.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>This is a whole new experience for me being on the net. So bear with
me.</B>
<P><B>Anyhow:</B>
<P>
<P><B>I have had several wierd things happen since I was a little girl. I</B>
<P><B>beleive that spirits know who they can get to and who they can not.
If</B>
<P><B>you are a beleiver they seem to know that.  One night my family was
in</B>
<P><B>bed and I was in my room and my sister was in another room. All of
a</B>
<P><B>sudden I felt someone grab my ankel and I screamed and when I looked
up</B>
<P><B>I saw a dark shadow going towards the hall way. When I screamed my
mom</B>
<P><B>and sister wanted to know what was wrong. I started yelling at my
sister</B>
<P><B>because I thought she grabbed my ankel being naught to me.  Well she</B>
<P><B>didn't do it and when I felt it she felt it also at the same time and</B>
<P><B>saw the black shadow like I did. This kind of thing happening at the</B>
<P><B>same time between me and my sister happend all the time. We were both</B>
<P><B>cleaning our rooms and all of a sudden we both heard a big boom. I
went</B>
<P><B>to her room and she was coming to mine. We both had a wooden letter
of</B>
<P><B>our first name hanging by the light switch on our walls. They both
fell</B>
<P><B>down at the same time and both broke in the same exact spot. It was
so</B>
<P><B>wierd.  The other things that happen with me are in dreams. My family</B>
<P><B>has an old farm house that we had built in the 1800's.  My family
still</B>
<P><B>lives in it to this day but they have renovated it into a duplex so
each</B>
<P><B>family has one side. One day I was telling my grandma about a dream
I</B>
<P><B>had about this beautiful house and how this lady had fallen down the</B>
<P><B>staires. I had told her all the details of the house and the details
of</B>
<P><B>the woman that had fallen down the stairs. I was mostly telling her
the</B>
<P><B>story because I just could  not figure out why I always have wierd</B>
<P><B>dreams and why in the world I had dreamt of a lady falling down the</B>
<P><B>stairs. Well come to find out the house that I had dreamt about was
the</B>
<P><B>original farm house before it was renovated and my great great
grandma</B>
<P><B>was the woman who had fallen down the stairs and broke her hip.  Most
of</B>
<P><B>my dreams are from family things that happen. My mother has had many</B>
<P><B>many things happen to her. When she fist got married her and my
father</B>
<P><B>lived in an old house in town that was above the underground railroad</B>
<P><B>that went through our town. She would always put the cats down in the</B>
<P><B>basement and lock the door with a skeleton key and put the key on the</B>
<P><B>sink.  Every morning the cats would be in the kitchen and the key
would</B>
<P><B>be in the door and the door would be open. My father was a
truckdriver</B>
<P><B>so he was always gone. She was also telling me of stories about how
they</B>
<P><B>put up a pool tabel and when my dad was gone the pool table would be</B>
<P><B>playing by itself.  She would also talk about red eyes that were only
as</B>
<P><B>tall as the top of her bed, and they would always be looking at her
at</B>
<P><B>night. Then they would move over the the rocking chair and the chair</B>
<P><B>would rock while the eyes were still on her. When she would wake dad
up</B>
<P><B>to see it they would disapear instant. There are many more things to</B>
<P><B>tell of this, but the funny and ironic thing is that when she moved
to</B>
<P><B>the original farm house I was telling you about earlier before I was</B>
<P><B>born, she was the red eyes the very first night she moved in, and my
dad</B>
<P><B>had just left do go on the road. She was so upset that she turned on
her</B>
<P><B>stomach and faced the headboard, when she opened her eyes she say the</B>
<P><B>figure of Jesus looking at her and from that moment on she never had</B>
<P><B>another problem. It is almost as if the family that has lived there
for</B>
<P><B>how many generations were there to help her and look after her.  My</B>
<P><B>aunts and uncle that live on either side of the house now say that
they</B>
<P><B>can feel someone looking at them throught the outside of the house
into</B>
<P><B>the windows. When they look they see shadows and just feel as thought</B>
<P><B>they are getting looked after.</B>
<P>
<P><B>No matter what there are these kinds of things all around us. Some
are</B>
<P><B>good things and some are bad but it will always be there.</B>

<P><B>Spirit Encounter, Face-To-Face</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: cuartodenefasto@email.msn.com</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P>
<P><B> This story took place in Cuba in the early 50's, before Castro</B>
<P><B>came to power. My mother told me this tale which was passed down to
her from</B>
<P><B>my grandmother who experienced it first-hand.</B>
<P><B>Before I go any further let me state now that my grandma was not drunk
nor</B>
<P><B>was she over worked, and finally, it was not late in the day. I say
this</B>
<P><B>because disbelievers will always resort to these so-called "explanations"
as</B>
<P><B>the quick way out.</B>
<P><B>Anyway, grandma was hanging clothes out to dry in broad daylight when</B>
<P><B>suddenly, she clearly saw a friend of the family who had passed away
some</B>
<P><B>time ago!</B>
<P><B>Shocked, she stated the obvious: "But didn't you die"!?</B>
<P><B>Incredibly, the ghost replied, "No, but (--------) did".  The person
the</B>
<P><B>spectre mentioned was a relative that no one in the household had any
reason</B>
<P><B>to suspect was sick much less dead.</B>
<P><B>My grandma looked down for a moment, trying to take all this in,</B>
<P><B>and as you can imagine, when she looked back up, the spirit was no
longer</B>
<P><B>there.</B>
<P><B>Well, she rushed in the house to tell everyone what she had witnessed</B>
<P><B>leaving everybody speechless. Sure enough, around an hour</B>
<P><B>later, the phone rang informing all what they already knew.</B>
<P><B>However, the caller said the relative had passed away just MINUTES</B>
<P><B>ago even though the ghost was seen a little under an HOUR ago!</B>
<P><B>Explanation? I have none.....</B>
<P>
<P><B>Our Friendly Visitor</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: alkaube@island.net</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B>We moved to the house we are currently living in over 9 years ago.
 Our</B>
<P><B>first clue that something was going on was when my 6 year old
daughter</B>
<P><B>said that she saw her baby sister walking in her room, well the baby</B>
<P><B>sister was at the time about a month or two old.  This happened a few</B>
<P><B>times and then she realized that it was not her younger sister but
a</B>
<P><B>very young child who would come to visit every so often.A year or so</B>
<P><B>later a friend was over and we were playing Nintendo and it was
getting</B>
<P><B>late in the evening when all of a sudden the channels on the t.v
started</B>
<P><B>changing, then the volume went up and down and then the t.v would go
on</B>
<P><B>and off.  This happened a few more times to the kids since that night.
</B>
<P><B>Also a few nights before Christmas we had the presents all wrapped
and</B>
<P><B>sealed in a big black garbage bag and beside our bed, when it was
about</B>
<P><B>3:00 am I woke to the sound of paper being torn.  I woke my husband
up</B>
<P><B>and said I thought we had some one in the house, but soon realized
the</B>
<P><B>noise was coming from the garbage bag. I thought it was possibly a
mouse</B>
<P><B>that got in and bit a hole in the bag, so we closed the bedroom door
and</B>
<P><B>we were going to check the bag.  Both my husband and I saw the bag
move</B>
<P><B>as if something was inside it.  Anyhow we opened the bag and found</B>
<P><B>nothing, the gifts were still wrapped and every thing was as it
should</B>
<P><B>be.  I had mentioned this to a neighbour who had lived near here for</B>
<P><B>about 20 plus years and she said oh thats just the ghost that lives</B>
<P><B>there, and that she heard about how it does pranks, she said that
there</B>
<P><B>was a little girl that had died as an infant in this house and has
been</B>
<P><B>known to pay visits every so often.  We are not frightened as there
has</B>
<P><B>been no reason to she has just played a few practical jokes.  Our</B>
<P><B>daughter said that she thinks she is friendly &amp; just kind of shy.</B>
<P>
<P><B>A Weird Story</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: paranoia_king@yahoo.com</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>     First let me explain about this old building near</B>
<P><B>my house. It's a really big old mill, textile I think.</B>
<P><B>My great-great-uncle (or someone along the lines of</B>
<P><B>that) owned it, back in the early 1900's. He was</B>
<P><B>making a ton of money with it, but he was trampled by</B>
<P><B>horses in there. It's fallen into decay since then.</B>
<P><B>     Now I'll get to the experience. One day, my</B>
<P><B>sister and I were just walking around in the mill,</B>
<P><B>looking around through all the old stuff. We heard a</B>
<P><B>noise upstairs, like a big "CLOP." We thought nothing</B>
<P><B>of it, just the rotted floors creaking. We heard it</B>
<P><B>again, and that was my cue to leave. I told my sister</B>
<P><B>I was going to walk home, and she said she was going</B>
<P><B>to hang around awhile. Later, when I was home, she</B>
<P><B>came running breathlessly into the house. I asked her</B>
<P><B>what was wrong. She said she saw something come down</B>
<P><B>the second floor steps. She said it was something like</B>
<P><B>a man with the legs of a horse, but she didn't know</B>
<P><B>because she went running as soon as she glimpsed it.</B>
<P><B>No one else was with us that day. I don't know if it</B>
<P><B>was the ghost of our dead uncle, a demon, a vagrant</B>
<P><B>living on the second floor, or something more</B>
<P><B>sinister, but I haven't gone in there since.</B>
<P><B>      </B>
<P><B>I Saw My Dad's Ghost, but He is Alive</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: m.j.williams@virgin.net</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P>
<P><B>When I was younger, I had my best friend stay the night and we talked</B>
<P><B>into the night and then she fell asleep. We slept in the gusest room
at</B>
<P><B>the end of the hallway and our hall was about 50 feet long (we had
a</B>
<P><B>very big house). I decided that I would go to my room and get a book
to</B>
<P><B>read until I feel asleep. I went to my room and got my book and went</B>
<P><B>back to bed. I heard a noise so I looked round the door. I saw my dad</B>
<P><B>walking down the hallway and he had a axe in his hand. </B>
<P><B>I thought, oh well and went back to reading. Then I thought of a</B>
<P><B>question for dad and I looked back round the door and all that was
left</B>
<P><B>was the axe. I walked up to it and it vanished. I ran into mom and
dad's</B>
<P><B>room and saw that only mom was in bed. When I told her that I had
seen</B>
<P><B>dad, she said, "How? Dad has been downstairs for an hour on the
phone."</B>
<P><B>I was so freaked that I woke Catlin and we slept in the room off the
end</B>
<P><B>of my mom and dad's bedroom.</B>
<P>
<P><B>House has a History</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: ymjuliano@hotmail.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>When I was a teenager, I used to hear my name being called.  The weird
thing </B>
<P><B>was, no matter how loud the noise was around me, the surrounding noise
would </B>
<P><B>become almost whisper-like while my name was spoken.  I couldn't tell
if it </B>
<P><B>was a man's or a woman's voice and it wouldn't happen with any regularity.
 </B>
<P><B>I know that I wasn't overhearing someone else being called as it always
used </B>
<P><B>my name in Hungarian, "Jolika", which no one but family uses to call
me.  </B>
<P><B>This would happen in malls, high school, while driving by myself in
the car, </B>
<P><B>at work, whereever.  I have not heard it for a long time.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Another, seemingly unrelated story:  Thirty years ago, my father and
mother </B>
<P><B>purchased a very old huge house which, prior to their purchasing it,
had </B>
<P><B>been converted into four apartment units.  Twenty years into their
marriage, </B>
<P><B>they divorced and my father moved into one of the units.  Later, his
</B>
<P><B>girlfriend and her teenage son moved in with him.  She would tell him
about </B>
<P><B>doors mysteriously closing without any windows or doors open to allow
for </B>
<P><B>drafts.  The doors that she would hear close were facing each other
and </B>
<P><B>closed in opposite directions, so a breeze would even be unlikely -
it </B>
<P><B>wouldn't be able to close both at the same time.  She even saw the
image of </B>
<P><B>an old man. Dad never believed her.  One night, her teenage son was
scared </B>
<P><B>out of his room by someone he could see sitting on his chest.  He slept
with </B>
<P><B>them that night. The son was going through an extremely rebellious
period, </B>
<P><B>so this was particularly odd.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Then many tenants began telling my father of a ghost figure that would
watch </B>
<P><B>TV with them or walk half-way across the floor and vanish.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I think the history of the house goes something like this:  An old
man had </B>
<P><B>built the home and somehow his adult children took possession of it
(I don't </B>
<P><B>know why - if the old guy died, or gave it, or sold it to them) and
they </B>
<P><B>eventually sold it to my parents.  All of the descriptions my father
has </B>
<P><B>heard from his girlfriend and many tenants over the years matches that
of </B>
<P><B>the old man.</B>
<P>
<P><B>My House</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: RASKLEKING@aol.com</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>I am twelve years old right now but in my life time I have had many
</B>
<P><B>encounters in my life.</B>
<P><B>	The first time I saw anything strange in my house was when I was </B>
<P><B>about five. I woke up in the middle of the night for no reason. No
nightmares </B>
<P><B>no noises nothing woke me up I just woke up. I lied in bed but couldn't
get </B>
<P><B>to sleep. So I decided to go get some water. When I came back I saw
a figure </B>
<P><B>of a man only it was really hazey and green. It was bending over my
brother's </B>
<P><B>bed. (we share a room.) It suddenly looked  at me and walked out the
wall.</B>
<P><B>	About a week later I woke up again for no reason. I knew something
</B>
<P><B>would happen. Then my virtual boy turned on. I saw red flashes coming
from it </B>
<P><B>and heard voices coming from it.</B>
<P><B>	After that nothing happened for about two years. Until one day when
</B>
<P><B>my brother and I came home from school to find that the t.v. in our
room was </B>
<P><B>on. We turned it off and went to get something to eat. When we came
back we </B>
<P><B>watched t.v. Suddenly the t.v. and the bureau it was on fell on my
brother. He </B>
<P><B>was okay but we didn't know what happened. We decided not to tell
anyone.</B>
<P><B>	A few years later we were playing outside. We had no lock for our
</B>
<P><B>shed so we used a small metal rod to keep it shut. However the little
rod </B>
<P><B>disappeared. While playing I found the rod. It was bent up in five
places and </B>
<P><B>had scratched in innumerable places. When we went back inside I saw
something </B>
<P><B>big black and furry hurry across the window.</B>
<P><B>	</B>
<P><B>	One night I had a nightmare that my dead black and white cat, max
</B>
<P><B>came back from the dead and attacked my family. Max had been dead about
a </B>
<P><B>year then. When I finally woke up my bed was covered with black and
white cat </B>
<P><B>fur. Yes, I said cat fur. A few days later my family found out that
our </B>
<P><B>female cat,Iris, was pregnant. and one of her kittens looked exactly
like Max.</B>
<P>
<P><B>	My last encounter was a few nights ago when I had a dream about a
</B>
<P><B>scarecrow with human's eyes and two hooks for hands. The scarecrow
kept its </B>
<P><B>eyes on me and me only. I woke up and saw something outside run across
the </B>
<P><B>yard. That morning my brother made a small metal object attached to
a string </B>
<P><B>hanging from the ceiling. The metal object started to swing violently
and I </B>
<P><B>suddenly fell asleep.</B>
<P>
<P><B>	Everyone that I told this to said that I am on drugs or something.
</B>
<P><B>But I'm not on drugs and this really happened. I am the only one who
believes </B>
<P><B>this.</B>

<P><B>Dream House</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: FA223@philipmorant.essex.sch.uk</B>
<P>
<P><B>Hello </B>
<P><B>my name is Ilona </B>
<P><B>I have a story to tell you, </B>
<P><B>just about a year ago we moved in to our new house my mum and dad
have</B>
<P><B>always liked old houses and this was their dream house. </B>
<P><B>The first night we move I slept in the back room we did have any
curtains</B>
<P><B>or carpets and none of the furniture had been unpacked the room was
bare so</B>
<P><B>what I am about to tell you couldn't have been a trick of the eyes.
I was</B>
<P><B>just about to go to sleep when I looked out the window from my bed
I saw a</B>
<P><B>a figure with long black hair look out the window it turn to me it
was</B>
<P><B>dripping with water a small puddle was forming around it's feet. I
tried</B>
<P><B>to scream but I could I was so scared that my voice had seized up .
That</B>
<P><B>night I slept on the landing. In the morining the figure was gone but</B>
<P><B>where it had been standing  was a white circleish shape with a small</B>
<P><B>puddle of water in the middle this frecked me out. My mum said it was
my</B>
<P><B>imagination but I had been wide awake, I could not go in the room for
a week.</B>
<P><B>About a month later me and my brother were talking on the landing,
we heard</B>
<P><B>footsteps coming up the stairs in a hury we ran to our bedrooms. We
thought</B>
<P><B>it was mum who was in a mood with us . We waited and waited but no
one</B>
<P><B>came up the stairs we slowly creeped out on to the landing and looked
</B>
<P><B>down the stairs but there was no one there. We were a little bit jumpy
</B>
<P><B>then something heavy fell in the bathroom we both screamed. Mum and
dad came</B>
<P><B>up we asked them if they had walked up the stair but they hadn't. The
ghost</B>
<P><B>has never reterned . But some times I see her in my dreams .</B>

<P><B>One day, my best friend, my mom and me were the only ones at home and
</B>
<P><B>my best friend and I at the time were really interested in ghosts.
 We</B>
<P><B>used to try to talk to them and stuff.  Well,  My best friend and I
were</B>
<P><B>in the living room and my mom was in the kitchen and all of a sudden,
a</B>
<P><B>basketball rolled into the kitchen from the hallway of the dining
room,</B>
<P><B>up a step into our kitchen out of nowhere.  It freaked my mom out and</B>
<P><B>she just about died.  No one else was home so we have no idea how the</B>
<P><B>ball got in motion in the first place, But even more extraordinary,
how</B>
<P><B>the ball bounced up the step when no force whatsoever was behind it.
 It</B>
<P><B>stills terrifies me to sleep in that room.  I am still convinced that
it</B>
<P><B>was a ghost, I guess there is no other way to explain the phenomenon.</B>
<P>
<P><B>In the Philippines</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: Shadow6595@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>Hi my name is Ryan, my story is based on my country and the things
that </B>
<P><B>happens to my country. First of all my country is the Philippines.
The </B>
<P><B>Philippines is a mysterious country with a lot of secrets that have
never </B>
<P><B>been revealed and some just kept for protection. The first things I'll
talk </B>
<P><B>about is the many different ghosts and spirits. In my country there
are many </B>
<P><B>forgotten souls and all these souls have a duty to accomplish, for
them to </B>
<P><B>rest in peace. Each of these souls have different forms, it can be
a ghost, a </B>
<P><B>troll, dog, bird, goats, shape shifters, and many others.</B>
<P><B>The first spirit I'll focus on is a ghost called the white lady
ghost.</B>
<P><B>This specific ghost is a lost soul which mostly hang around churches
or a </B>
<P><B>dead body which is not found. Is very hard to explain but somehow this
type </B>
<P><B>of ghost is not shy to appear in open crowds to prove it's point. This
ghost </B>
<P><B>never shows his or her face to the living, it walks with the face looking
</B>
<P><B>back. This ghost appears as a mist and a white bright light, sometimes
the </B>
<P><B>head would be cut off and it would be holding it by his or her side.
When </B>
<P><B>this ghost disappears it just vanishes and leaves a black mark which
looks </B>
<P><B>like a burned area. In this very spot it disappears in it may have
the body </B>
<P><B>underground or some kind of riches. If a person finds a body the person
have </B>
<P><B>to give it a proper burial or that person who found it will die. If
the </B>
<P><B>person finds the riches he have to find the family which it belongs
to or </B>
<P><B>that person will die. </B>
<P><B>The next spirit will talk about is called a Tikbalang. This is one
of the </B>
<P><B>most well known spirit in the Philippines.  This spirit has territories
which </B>
<P><B>it protects from intruders. To protect it's territory it sometimes
turns into </B>
<P><B>a human that has a missing detail and this detail is the in the face.
It's </B>
<P><B>face is missing an indent on the upper lip.</B>
<P><B>This specific detail is how a person can tell them apart. It protects
it's </B>
<P><B>territory by making a person lost forever by bribing her or him for
a drink </B>
<P><B>or to help you on your destination. It sometimes just blend in to darkness
</B>
<P><B>and waits for a person to bad mouth it. When this happens it will haunt
the </B>
<P><B>person forever until that person freaks out or die. If none of this
happens </B>
<P><B>it will get a person in their sleep and tie them on top of a high tree
with </B>
<P><B>no way to get down. To make a person lost it will make illusions like
a </B>
<P><B>mirage and the only odor that a person will smell is manure. This is
one of </B>
<P><B>the most dangerous spirits which no one better mess with. These are
just some </B>
<P><B>spirits and ghosts. There are many more where that came from, is just
that it </B>
<P><B>would be too much to explain each and every one of them. But I'll try
to add </B>
<P><B>some more on my free time. If any body have any questions please be
free to </B>
<P><B>write me. </B>

<P><B>Shadow in the Doorway</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: tamdan@monti.net</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>A few months ago I was sitting up in bed watching tv, and my husband
was</B>
<P><B>just dozing off beside me when I looked over and saw a figure standing
in</B>
<P><B>our bedroom doorway.  It was dark and I could make out no features
but it</B>
<P><B>definately was a man.  I wanted to scream but I couldn't, but I managed
to</B>
<P><B>grab my husbands arm and by this time the figure had disappeared. 
When I</B>
<P><B>told him what I saw, he nodded and simply said we would talk about
it in</B>
<P><B>the morning.  The next day we were having coffee and he preceded to
tell me</B>
<P><B>he has saw this man several times.  He never attempts to enter the
bedroom,</B>
<P><B>he just watches from the door.  This really freaked me out.  I did
not</B>
<P><B>sleep well for the next several days.  A friend suggested I put a
video</B>
<P><B>camera up on the dresser and see what we got.  I was afraid that if
I did</B>
<P><B>this and saw something, I wouldn't be able to sleep... ever.  One day
I was</B>
<P><B>so tired and it was in the middle of the afternoon.  My husband was
outside</B>
<P><B>and I decided it was time to talk to this thing.  I went into my
bedroom,</B>
<P><B>sat on my bed and said, "I don't know who you are, and I don't think
you</B>
<P><B>are here to hurt anyone, but you scare me."  "If you want to stay
that's</B>
<P><B>fine, but at night please stay away from my bedroom door."  Since
that</B>
<P><B>night we have heard strange noises throughout the rest of the house,
but</B>
<P><B>there have been no more figures standing in our bedroom door.</B>

<P><B>The Legend of Canters Cave</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: helmickd@bright.net</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P>
<P><B>This comes from Canters Cave in Jackson Ohio.  A 4h camp.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Back about the 17 or 1800's there was a religion that believed the
end</B>
<P><B>of the world was to come on a certain day.  All who believed this was
to</B>
<P><B>find a remote place in the woods and put on white extension gowns and</B>
<P><B>praise the lord so they too would go to be with the Lord.  The was
a man</B>
<P><B>named Thomas Canter whose family believed this.  So  they sold all
of</B>
<P><B>their belongings and went to a cave.  It was a stormy night that
night.</B>
<P><B>They put on their robs and praised on that night.  They woke up the
next</B>
<P><B>morning and nothing had happened it was a beautiful day.  They
thought</B>
<P><B>it was a mistake so they stayed and kept trying.  Slowly people
started</B>
<P><B>leaving saying it was not going to happen.  At last everyone had gone</B>
<P><B>but Thomas.  Over the winter the family do not come visit.  The next</B>
<P><B>spring they went to give him food.  No one ever saw him again.  The</B>
<P><B>thought either an animal had got him or he had run away in shame.
 They</B>
<P><B>say if you go to Canters Cave on a stormy night you can see Thomas
in</B>
<P><B>his white rob reaching  for the sky.</B>

<P><B>The Suicide Guy Next Door</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: kids6@home.com</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B>	I used to live in these apartments, and two new guys moved in next
door</B>
<P><B>to me. One of them was named John. He used to work and came home
every</B>
<P><B>night around 6pm with a case of beer. This carried on for about three</B>
<P><B>months.</B>
<P>
<P><B>One night he didn't come home, and I seemed to miss greeting him by
his</B>
<P><B>door. Later that night his roomate that also worked, came home late,</B>
<P><B>around midnight.</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B>All of a sudden I woke to the sound of sirens.</B>
<P>
<P><B>My mom had talked to the police and they had said that John had</B>
<P><B>committed suicide by drinking Sionide(a pestiside).They explained in</B>
<P><B>full detail that he had thrown up his stomach and most of his insides.
I</B>
<P><B>ran back into my house horrified about what I had heard, and looked
out</B>
<P><B>of my window(whiched faced the parking lot) For some relief. To my</B>
<P><B>suprise, I saw the coronor lift the blanket from the body. The body</B>
<P><B>made me sick to my stomach, and I ran into my room and fell asleep.
</B>
<P>
<P><B>I awoke remembering what the dead body looked like. The finger nails</B>
<P><B>were black, and his face was white and his skin flaky. His teeth were</B>
<P><B>green and yellow. Not plaque yellow, but almost a sickening yellow,
like</B>
<P><B>they had been dyed that color. It was the most horrible sight that
I had</B>
<P><B>ever seen in my life.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Two weeks later his roommate moved to a different apartment, in the</B>
<P><B>acomplex. About a week after that, I started seeing things fall of
my</B>
<P><B>shelf as I walked in my room. I would run out screaming and go sit
out</B>
<P><B>on my couch. I would turn to look to a side of me and would see an</B>
<P><B>indent on my couch beside me. It would feel as if somone was sitting</B>
<P><B>next to me. Every where i went for the day, I would have dreams about
in</B>
<P><B>my sleep. Like if I went to the store I would have a dream about
going</B>
<P><B>to the store and the dead body of John standing right beside me the</B>
<P><B>whole time.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I would tell my mom about this and she thought that I was psycho. She</B>
<P><B>sent me to counseling immediately. The counselor asked me stupid</B>
<P><B>questions, and after about a month or so, she came to the conclusion</B>
<P><B>that John wanted to know where his roomate had moved to.</B>
<P>
<P><B>That day when I went home, I went to the guy's house, and told him
about</B>
<P><B>what had happened. Then he said that he didn't want to hide from his</B>
<P><B>friend no more, and I haven't seen the ghost since.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Pretty soon John's old roomate told me that he now had been seeing</B>
<P><B>strange things happen and that he knew it was John, because ever
night</B>
<P><B>at 6pm. he would smell John's favorite beer.</B>
<P>
<P><B>What is it I Don't Know</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: remierez@netzero.com</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P>
<P><B>As far back as I can </B>
<P><B>remember and from what my mother has told me I always talked with a
Indian that </B>
<P><B>I called Shaman. I don't know if he really was a Shaman or not but
he was </B>
<P><B>always friendly with me and sometimes when my friends and I would camp
out we </B>
<P><B>would here drums from afar and every once in awhile we would catch
the glimpse </B>
<P><B>of a head peeking at us from the woods. Years would go by and I would
talk to </B>
<P><B>him from time to time. But there was others in the house also I never
really saw </B>
<P><B>them but would catch glimpses of them. But one night when my uncle
and </B>
<P><B>he's friend were at my house they where going up stairs when a women
came </B>
<P><B>floating down the stairs at them and would simply vanish. He's friend
also </B>
<P><B>stated that one night when he walked past my room, I was spending the
night at a </B>
<P><B>friends house so it couldnt have been me, that a deep voice said come
here </B>
<P><B>boy, and he ran down stairs. With the wild mood swings that I was </B>
<P><B>getting my mom was looking everywhere for help. Well one </B>
<P><B>day she told a friend about it, this friend was a practioner of magic
and spells </B>
<P><B>and such and she came to my house and began chanting a spell in my
house. </B>
<P><B>I don't know why but I was getting off the bus and I was full of anger
I keep </B>
<P><B>saying to my self get her out get her out. I went into the house and
</B>
<P><B>upstairs where I found her and my mom and I exploded yelling and screaming
at </B>
<P><B>both of them and I left. I kept hearing we are going to get her. After
</B>
<P><B>that day her life went down hill she lose her husband and her kids
moved in with </B>
<P><B>him. I dont </B>
<P><B>think it was Shaman who was there but ever since that day I haven't
been able to </B>
<P><B>talk to him. We moved out of that house when I was 18 and I am now
</B>
<P><B>23. Evey once </B>
<P><B>in awhile I well see or hear something strange but I still haven't
seen this </B>
<P><B>spirit. I've had many experiences with hauntings my mother says I'm
a magnet that </B>
<P><B>gets attracted to them. </B>
<P><B>Thanks for your time.</B>
