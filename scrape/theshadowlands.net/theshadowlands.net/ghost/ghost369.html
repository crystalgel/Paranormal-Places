<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">it was on christmas night
when all this happened.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">everyone was leaving to the
program and i was home alone with my dog. i was laying down on the couch
watching some christmas movie almost about to doze off. when i was almost
asleep i heard movement behind the other couch across from where i was and i
thought it was only the dog so i left it alone. the noise kept getting louder
like something chewing on a bone. when all of a sudden my dog barked from the
outside and the chewing noises stopped, that woke me up because i thought the
dog was in the house with me. i looked toward to where the noises were coming
from but it was a little too dark to see because there was only the t.v. on. i
kept my eyes on the spot where the noises were and sure enough i saw something
but couldnt notice what it was. then the t.v. turned off and that scared me
alot, i was frozen and kept my eyes on the spot. it was dark inside but i still
can see the 'thing', it looked like it was moving toward me very slowly,
crawling like. the window curtain was open so there was a little light from the
moon and i can see it, the whole thing. to me it looked like a half-person. i
was VERY scared and couldnt believe what i was seeing. i closed my eyes hoping
that it would go away, when i opened my eyes it was still there and i can see
its eyes looking back at me wide-eyed. i closed my eyes and started to pray as
hard as i could, then the t.v. turned back on. i got up from the couch and
turned the lights on, to this day i still wonder if it was a dream or not. then
again, i hear stories from my sisters about something sounding like its eating
in the house when they're alone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">my name is sarah I am a
sixteen year old girl from </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">england</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-family: Arial;"> and I would like to share my one and only experiance
with you. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">My story: <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I have just left a school
for disabled children in </span><st1:place><st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;">Hampshire</span></st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;">, </span><st1:country-region><span style="font-family: Arial;">England</span></st1:country-region></st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">. It was here that I had my first experiance with the
paranormal. I have always been a bit of a sceptic when it comes to the
paranormal but this experiance has convinced me beyond any doubt that there is
something after this life. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I was sat at my computor
emailing friends. Some of my class mates were also in the room but they were
sat at their desks which were at least a foot away from mine. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Anyway, all of a sudden I
felt something touch my head. It was like somebody with freezing cold hands
giving me a head massage. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">At first I thought that it
might of been my friend Holley playing with my hair because she does that a lot
and her hands are usually cold. So I turned round to ask her if she knew how
cold her hands were but she wasnt stood behind me! <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Instead she was sat with her
boyfriend at his computor desk which is about three foot away from mine. It
would have been impossible for her to touch my hair. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Worried that I might have
been imagining things, I asked my friends if they had noticed anything. Most of
them said no, except my boyfriend who said he had noticed a black shape stood
near me but couldn't be sure of what he saw. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">After this I became very
scared and decided it would be better if I left the room. I have not
experianced anything after this incident and would rather I didn't. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Thank you for listening and
keep up the good work<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I came upon your site while
searching for a haunted tour in </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">Gettysburg</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have a
place to add.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It's the house I grew up
in as a child in Conestoga, </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">Pennsylv</span><st1:PersonName><span style="font-family: Arial;">ania</span></st1:PersonName></st1:place></st1:State><span style="font-family: Arial;">, on a street called </span><st1:Street><st1:address><span style="font-family: Arial;">Stony Lane</span></st1:address></st1:Street><span style="font-family: Arial;">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">We had a 2 story house, with
offices in the lower part (Dad sold insurance).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This was out in the country...</span><st1:Street><st1:address><span style="font-family: Arial;">Stony Lane</span></st1:address></st1:Street><span style="font-family: Arial;"> wasn't even paved until 1990.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I always thought I was the only one to
hear/see things, but later found out that my father's secretary heard many of
the same things.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My room was overtop of
the conference area downstairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only
when I was alone would I hear sounds of the chairs being moved around and
scraping the floor, and 2 men talking to each other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It happened so frequently that, in the
beginning, when I was around 13 or so, I'd think Dad was home and go downstairs
to find everything dark and unoccupied.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Later, I knew it was ghosts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
would also have my alarm clock go off at weird times of the night, that I
didn't set it to.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was very
annoying.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I also had an antique tea cup
fall off of my dresser and break.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No
reason, it just fell.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My tv would turn
up in volume periodically, as would my stero.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Once, when I was a child, I was making a time capusle for school.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was about 10 years old.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was recording my "life story" on
a cassette recorder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I got to the
part where I said I was a christian, a squeaky female voice said, "and
that's true!".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I rewound it and I
could hear the voice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was alone at the
time it was made, no one was home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was
so freaked out I ran outside and buried the time capsule, and years later when
I searched for it, I couldn't find it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
tried digging several times.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Probably the most scary
thing that happened was when I was outside in the woods in front of the house
and I turned around, and a black figure with glowing red eyes was in front of
me, about 10 feet away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I could see the
house through the figure, so it was transparent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I can still see that like it was yesterday,
and I'm 30 now, so it was about 22 years ago.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I told my parents but they didn't believe me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It vanished in front of my eyes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I always believed the house was haunted, and
was always scared to be alone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I used to
lock myself in my room when I no one was home, which was often.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My father used to say the house was buried on
an indian burial ground, and I've found many arrowheads on the property, so who
knows, maybe he's right.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I have a story I would like
to share. I was about 18 or 19 and Krissy a friend and I decided to go camp out
for the night. My family has some farmland and I decided that was the best
place to go. So we packed up and left for the site, When we arrived to my
uncles farm I told them that we were going to camp out on the river bank until
morning then we would leave. Well everything was going well, fire burning and
everything. I fell asleep about 11:30 after making sure she was sleeping
well,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>About 1:30am Krissy woke me and
ask if I heard something in the water, I told her we were in the country and it
was just an animal in the river. Alittle later she woke me again and said
"listen to that sound" I sat up and for a few seconds didn't hear
anything and then, I heard something that I had never heard before, I was
rasied in the country know how animals behave at night( deer,dogs raccoons).
But this was something not natural. There was the sound of someone or something
in the river, and not natural sound. The hair on the back of my neck stood up
the sounds got closer (sounded like someone thrashing around in the river . By
this time Krissy could see what it was and all I could hear is the sound of a
low groaning like something was in pain. I ask her what do you see and she
jumped up and ran. I started to turn around and that little voice in the back
of my mind said RUN AND WHAT EVER YOU DO DON'T LOOK BACK. So I ran up the bank
and met up with Krissy at my truck. That is where we spent the night but I
didn't sleep much,<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I ask her what seen and all
she would say is SOMETHING when I ask something what?? she would cry. I went to
the river back to get our camping gear and check for animal tracks but no
tracks to be found on the back just the camp, the burned logs from the camp
fire but no tracks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have visited the
site many times but only in the daytime and still get the strange feeling that
there is something there. To this day Krissy will not tell me what she had seen
on the river bank. Its still always SOMETHING but after a few years she now
will say SOMETHING HORRIBLE that noone should ever see again. Its been almost
10 years since then and still the hair on the back of my neck stands up even
now, writing my story for your readers. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Hi, I wanted to add one of
my experiences to the website, so I thought I would share it with you. I moved
into an apartment in the beginning of 2004, and from the time that I stepped
into the house, it felt as if someone was watching me. I would get real nervous
being home alone when my mom and my siblings would leave. I had several
encounters with what I believe is the spirit or spirits of the apartment. I was
in the shower on time, and I heard footsteps in the bathroom. I always lock the
door so no one could've gotten in. The water turned brown and when I turned to
shut the water off, I saw a shadow of a person standing on the other side of
the curtain. I pulled it open and there was nothing there. Also, my couch was
against a wall that looked right down the hall to the bedrooms. My sister's
room was right across from mine. On three occasions, I saw a black shadow
figure run from room to room back and forth. One night, I went to bed it was
around </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="23"><span style="font-family: Arial;">11:00
 PM</span></st1:time><span style="font-family: Arial;">. I went to lay down and
out of the corner of my eye, I say a pair of red eyes looking at me through my
closet door. I leave it open for my cat who likes to sleep in there. I knew
something was up because she wouldn't come into the room. Later that night I
awoke to sounds in my bathroom which was the master bath in my room. I heard
footsteps again and children laughing. I went to get up and the bathroom door
shut. I ran up and grabbed the door, opened it, and nothing was there. The
final time that I ever had anything scary happen to me was about a month before
I moved. I was not feeling well and got up to get a drink of water. I had just
turned into the hall and a woman came running at me. She got about an inch or
two from my face and she disappeared. You could see her face and everything. I
was so scared. I fell to the ground and screamed. After that, I prayed and told
the ghost not to come back. That was the last time that I ever had any
encounter with the ghost(s) of the house. Feel Free to e-mail me back at
tucsontobey@aol.com or truedaniel_G@hotmail.com for further information.
Thanks.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Ok, some people think cats
&amp; dogs ect. Can see ghosts. Well I used to own rabbits, mice, hamsters,
stuff like that. Well, I got a cat right before some of my other pets starting
dying. Each time one would die, he would watch nothing run around. Once while
he was a kitten,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>he began watching the
bathroom door. I was sitting on the floor and watched him back up slowly, then
run behind the toilet. Then he ran to the other side and peeked around the
edge. He could barely leave the b-room. Also once he saw something on the other
side of the bed, then ran to the door and stopped dead. He looked behind the
door and made him self jump then ran down stairs. None of my 3 cats would go in
my room for a few weeks. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Let me start out with basic
info, I am presently 31, and since I was a child I recall a ton of strange
things and sightings, and sounds.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I grew up in </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">Corpus Christi</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;">, </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">Portland</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;">,
and </span><st1:place><st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;">Taft</span></st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;">, </span><st1:State><span style="font-family: Arial;">TX</span></st1:State></st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">. Since I can remember running around as a youngster
I can tell you things that happened like it happened yesterday. My first
"sighting" was when I was about 7 we were in the front yard of my
grandma's house in Taft Tx, and the Frisbee flew across the fence, on double
dare my cousin and I went to get it and at the end of the road i could see this
man playing marbles but no head. I freaked out ran back into the house and this
was<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>how this story of my life takes
place. I grew up with knowledge of the unknown, so of course maybe that's why i
am the way I am today. at about the age of 13 I actually felt someone. I came
in from feeding the dog (now in </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">Houston</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;">) and felt someone following me form the back yard. i
ran inside, sat on my couch with my step dad in one room my older sister in
another, i was in the living room, when from no where i get the feeling of
someone starring at me. I look the the left and a hand touched my shoulder, i
screamed as hard as I could, and totally cried my eyes out. Continuing to go
during the summers to taft, i would begin to see an increasingly amount of
things.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I got married at 18, and
unfortunately didn't get to spend a quit amount of time with my father in law,
he passed away a yr into my marriage. then my mother in laws house began to
make strange happenings, with an internal lock, in the middle of the night, we
began to hear noises as the door would unlock and open alone. this happened nightly
for a few months. one night my husbands aunt called, asking if I could bring
her milk. Being t kind person I am, I said yes, getting into my car, I began to
notice something int he sky, no not a plane, but a figure. and with my voice
completely taken back, this HUGE white bird flew over, I could see it as it
passed, until it flew away. By then I was like 24, at the age of 25 I bought my
first house. I had 3 kids and was happy. then with the drop of a dime, life
started turning, I became depressed and struggling with my marriage. TVs
started turning on alone, my daughters room would turn seriously cold, and i
began waking up with deep scratches all over my body. Dreams were becoming
seriously scary and i would drink coffee at night so i could stay up a little
later then everyone. for 6 months i was like this, and then little things began
to catch my attention, I began "thinking" of what could happen and
how, and then telling my sister and within time it would. I got scared, and
stopped or at least tried to. We lost our house in Allyson here in </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">Houston</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;">, the water went in 3 ft, and stayed for 5 days. so
back to my mom in laws.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Things were OK
for a while, you know actually settled down.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">And then, we rented another
house. My first night there, I saw a man in my hallway, i was in the kitchen
and i saw him come from the bedroom into the living room, at first i thought it
was my husband, and when i realized it was not, thought not again. I didn't
feel threatened by this man, just very aware of his presence. I would drive to
the corner store and literally see him in the passenger seat of my vehicle.
Still not frightened, I thought ok, this one is ok. 5 months passed and I was
laying down next to my husband talking, when i saw this little girl pass threw
the doorway to my bedroom and instantly screamed, i was so scared, chills and
tears. I clinged to my husband whom at this point was freaking out completely
he had never seen me so frightened. I closed my eyes while he got up to see
what I saw, or at least to try and put sense to it. nothing. As I knew he would
find, absolutely NOTHING. Then sl ly but surely the dreams began again. The
foresight was coming back. Well, now 31 new house, and a busy life. I have
lived in the new house 5 days a whole 5 days. And 2 nights ago, while we were
all awake, and in the living room. a knocking came to our door. No one in
sight. the curtains were open and just a nod of the head is a view to the door.
NO ONE.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Last night, again, the dreams
began. I awoke at </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="3"><span style="font-family: Arial;">3 am</span></st1:time><span style="font-family: Arial;">. sweating and
feeling a feeling I had not felt, Fright, and pain. I couldn't open my eyes,
and I couldn't hear. But I was wide awake. It follows me, It happens in front
of people, and lets a selected few hear it. But I am with it everyday. It is
hard.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Hello, my name is Reana..and
I came across your site the other day and it sparked memories of an instance
that happened to me when I was around 8 yrs old. I have never really told
anyone other than my Grandmother and Mother, because the whole thing shook me
up so bad..and I also thought everyone would think me completely crazy..or just
imaginative. I was watching TV with my Grandma one night in her room, which was
dark at the time &lt;no lights on&gt;..when she left the room to get a cup of
tea, I jumped on her bed and laid down on my back watching the TV upside down
with my head hanging off the edge a bit...when I felt something tug my hair,
quite forcefully, as if to pull me off the bed. I quickly tried to jump up in
surprise and a bit of fright...but as I tried to sit up it felt as if a heavy
weight was keeping me against the bed...out of nowhere a shadowy figure
appeared atop me, as if straddling my body and placed both its
"hands" against my mouth..I tried screaming for my Grandma but it
really was as if a person was covering my mouth...my sounds only came out as a
muffle. I looked up all the while as this was happening, and the shadowy
presence looked as if it was wearing a dirty torn "shroud" covering
it's head and "body". Though it looked so transparent and misty...it
still held me in place...and I can remember red eyes....and as I was fighting
to get free, it looked down at me and laughed this almost Horror movie-ish
sounding evil, gritty cackle like laugh...and disappeared..as if nothing happened.
I tore out of the room crying and sobbing to my Grandma...I think my hysterics
and shaking scared her witless...but I remember her just hugging me and trying
to calm me down...she's as rattled about it as I was. And I never went back in
that room. I know this sounds completely crazy...but I swear every bit is
true...I'm 25 now and I can still see that figure in my mind to this day and
that spooky laugh..it still gives me chills when I think of it. I guess my only
question is was it a ghost...a demon....I don't know what to think
anymore...I've always believed in the paranormal...but have never witnessed it
as I did that day when I was a little girl. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Brother<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">my brother seems to attract
supernatural activity, though he has managed to consistantly ignore it through
his lifetime. still, i grew up with him. i saw what was happening, though he
seemed to be pretty sucessful at blocking out the realization that it was
happening around only himself. for one, as a teenager, he had a poltergiest. it
wasn't the kind you read about in ghost stories. it wasn't always there,
tormenting us, but it would make itself known here and there, and always when
he was in the house. once, it pulled one of thoes tiny computer speakers off of
a shelf. the speaker wire was running behind a row of heavy books, all of which
tumbled onto his head. i saw this happen. the speaker literally hovered there
in the air for a few seconds before it fell with the rest of the contents of
the shelf. it would hold the front door half shut sometimes when we tried to
unlock and open it. once or twice, it actually shoved the door shut in my
father's face. and once, it spoke my name aloud when i was cleaning the
livingroom. it was a woman's voice, low and raspy. my brother was sitting in
his room at the time, reading, no music, no computer, absolutely silent and
with the door shut. and of course, it couldn't have been him. it was a woman.
once it manifested as a black shape in our hallway and enveloped my mother. i
could not see any of her inside whatever it was, but i could still hear her
screaming right next to me. luckily, it didn't actually hurt her. she jumped
back and nearly took me down in trying to escape. after regaining my balance, i
looked up and found it had gone, leaving only a moonlit hallway. my brother was
asleep just beyond the door the shape had appeared in front of.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">the other thing that
happened to him started when he displayed a family heirloom on the back of his
bedroom door. my grandfather's job in WW2 was to pick up the dead bodies of
American soldiers. once, he took a Japanese flag off the chest of a fallen
Japanese soldier as he was rooting around for more American bodies to clean up.
it was soaked in the man's blood. he probably shouldn't have taken it, i know,
but it had already been in my father's possesion for years before i realized
how wrong it was for my grandfather to have done something like that. this man
DIED for that flag, probably, and then the flag was raided off of him by an
enemy soldier. now, it's a threadbare rag with a red circle in the middle,
blood stains still easily visible, turned dark brown, stored safely away from
the house in a little box in the storage shed. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">the flag still reeks of
rotten blood. i have no idea why my brother wanted to display the thing. maybe
he thought a blood soaked flag would look cool. he WAS pretty young at the
time, afterall. anyways, the nightmares started the night he hung the flag. he
started waking up, moaning. i've always been a chronic insomniac and our rooms
shared a poorly insulated wall, so i was awake most nights and could hear him
do it every night he had the nasty blood soaked thing up in his room. i could
hear him walking around in there, too. really fast, nearly stomping, and it
almost sounded like there were several of him, all wearing heavy boots and
making them clomp around on his hardwood floor. he started reporting that he
was dreaming of a forest scene appearing in his room, with soldiers marching
through, getting mowed down by gunfire. he said it was so vivid he could smell
gunpowder, see flashes of light from the explosions reflecting off the paint on
his walls, smell blood and hear men screaming from the bushes that had somehow
appeared out of his floors. once, he told me he was unsure whether it was a
dream or a waking hallucination. he often told me that the dreams scared him
because most nights he would see a dead man on his floor, all full of bullet
holes. he said he was scared to leave his bed, even to pee. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">but what about those
footsteps? i didn't tell him about my hearing that because i knew he would do
like he always did when something strange like that happened around him and
pretend he didn't understand. it was as if he knew, but didn't want to know.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">he must have guessed
something, though, because he took the flag down after about a month of sleep
interrupted by the same gory nightmare and let my dad put it in the storage
shed in our backyard. the nightmares instantly stopped. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">that very night he slept
peaceful for the first time in weeks. no more sounds of booted feet coming
through my wall, either.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Encounter<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">By: CasonFamily@cox.net<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I am a law enforcement officer
for the State of </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">Florida</span></st1:place></st1:State><span style="font-family: Arial;">. I wanted to relay an experience I had earlier this
year. It was about 5 in the afternoon and it was somewhat chilly outside.This
happend in January before the time changed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I was about to go off duty and I had to finish my daily paperwork,
tickets-gas reciepts etc. The area I work in is a state preserve in west </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">Florida</span></st1:place></st1:State><span style="font-family: Arial;">. The preserve is about 5,000 acres and has a
north-south road/highway that goes through it. I had pulled my patrol car
through the preserve parking lot.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This parking
area is big turnaround.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had the car
placed facing the road like I was going to pull out. This was done to deter any
speeders that would have happened to come by.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The parking area was deserted. When I pulled through,I did not see
anyone in the pine woods that surround the parking area. There was practically
no traffic on the road on this particular day. As I was sitting there doing my
paperwork, I saw something to my left out of the corner of my eye. I saw this
man, he looked as though he was in his late teens to early twenties. He had
older clothing on, by older I mean clothing I saw groing up in the early to mid
80's. He was somewhat pale as well. I thought that perhaps he needed some help
so I rolled down my window and asked "Can I help you"? He smiled and
said that he was just going home and thought that he would say hi. This took me
aback somewhat because most people dont want to say hi to the police.Also due
to the fact that he just appeared out of nowhere when just seconds earlier I
had not seen anyone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He asked me what my
job was. I told him that I am the officer assigned to look over the preserve. I
also told him I was trying to cut down on the speeders out here as well. I
remember he said that was good because somebody could get hurt out here.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We made small talk for about 2 minutes.
Talking about nothing in particular. He did say he was very saddened to see the
area grow at the rate that it has.(Down the road about 3 miles are several new
housing developments going in) He then told me that he had to go home, I said
Ok, I told him to take care. I turned my head around to my right to adjust my
radio,I looked down, maybe 5 seconds at the most, and when I turned back, he
was gone. He was nowhere to be seen.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That really got me thinking. How can someone just disappear like
that?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I got out of the car and looked
around the parking area. Nobody was there. I looked out into the pine woods, no
one out there either.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I walked back to
the road. I looked north and south and didnt see a soul. It would be virtually
impossible for someone to leave that area that quick and for me not to see
where they went. The pine woods are fairly open and you can see very far into
the woods. The road is straight with no hills. A person can see well for
several miles in each direction. I got into my patrol car and drove south for
about 2 miles. All the while looking into the woods. Didn't see anything. I
turned back around and went north, didn't see anything there either.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was just like this man disappeared off the
face of the Earth. After that I spoke with some freinds of mine at the Highway
Patrol. They told me that this particular stretch of road has seen its share of
fatal accidents. The </span><st1:PersonName><span style="font-family: Arial;">Sheri</span></st1:PersonName><span style="font-family: Arial;">ffs office told me that they have recovered several
bodies over the years. The bodies were found in the woods before the State of </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">Florida</span></st1:place></st1:State><span style="font-family: Arial;"> purchased the land for preservation purposes. Also
there are accounts from old timers of a family graveyard on the preserve by the
shores of the bay. Many times while patrolling on my ATV, I would try to find
this graveyard, however I had no luck.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This story is not very scary, just very weird to say the least. I did
not feel scared when I talked with this person. However, I did feel sad and
felt a sense of longing for something. Like someone lost for instance. If you
are interested or if someone has had a similar experience please email me.
Thanks.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Since I was about 8 years
old, I have had dreams about a little blond haired boy (about the size of ten)
with a bowl hair cut, striped long sleeved shirt and blue jeans. In my dreams,
he was always just standing in my livingroom with his pale face, staring at me.
In my dreams he was in, my house was always haunted. Well, about three years
ago, things got weird in my house. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>My bedroom is connected to the livingroom
which is closed off by two painted glass double doors. My bed use to face the
glass double doors, and at night I'd just lay awake and would feel someone
watching me while my parents slept in the next room. I would see the silhouette
of a child about four feet tall at my bedroom door, just stand there. It never
moved, only faded. I never felt threatened just uncomfortable as this was
something totally new to me. As weeks went on, I finally told my mother because
she is the only person who, like myself, believe in the paranormal. She then
told me that some nights while she falls asleep watching TV in the livingroom,
she would see a little boy staring at her from the kitchen doorway (the rooms
are all connected). She described the boy and it sounded very similar to the
boy I had dreams about as a girl. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Months went on, and we let
my dad know-who is an extreme skeptic by the way. He was the only one who
didn't take the boy seriously. My mother and I dubbed the ghost 'Sammy'-it
seemed to fit. Then things started to get funny. It seemed like Sammy started
picking on my dad. At night, my dad sleeps with the air conditioner full blast
or he can't sleep. He awoke during the nights several times because the air
conditioner was turned completely off. He complained to me. He went to boil
some eggs for himself while my mother and I sat talking in the livingroom, he
returns to the kitchen and yells because the flame is on all the way high when
he left it low. He thought I did it. At 3 or </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="4"><span style="font-family: Arial;">4 am</span></st1:time><span style="font-family: Arial;"> he hears a child running up and down from his room
to my room. He complained to me again. But when his foot was slapped while
hearing a child's giggle in two seperate occassions last year, he finally
stopped complaining and became a believer. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Sammy's still here, even
though I moved my bed to face another section of my room, he sits on the ledge
of my father's doorway and watches me sleep. He still comes to make my feet
vibrate when I'm trying to sleep but we've gotten use to him around. I talk to
him out loud from time to time. He's a good kid. I just wonder what happened to
him that he's still here. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">My girlfriend and I joined a
group of six others, a paranormal research group one night. We had many
encounters that night. There are many children spirits there, both inside and
out. There is also a demon spirit, possibly two. My video camera worked fine
before and after. However, It wouldn't while we were inside or on the grounds.
It also could shoot infrared as well. When inside the gym, my friend heard a
horrible snarreling growl pass by her and a friend. It wanted us out. Also,when
we were in the boiler room, We got a low temperature reading only in the boiler
,.then we all(our group of four) heard the school bell ring. It was a little
faint,and definatly time to leave. By the way, there was no electricity that
the bell could ring. Upon leaving, I noticed that the only building that had
collapsed, was the church there. Oh yes, when we entred the building I could
feel my bangs on the left slightly moving, I knew someone was playing with
them, and my friend could see it moving, I was never affraid of this
experience. So much more happened. I was upset when my son told me he went. He
too experienced a lot. My son and I have had many encounters that have been
whitnessed by others.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Hi. I enjoyed looking at
your website and have always been fascinated by the supernatural. The story
about twin churches is close to what I heard growing up, but the version that
my grandfather told me was that the preacher was indeed having an affair, but
he was also involved in satanic rituals. After all was said and done, people
figured he was trying to "brainwash" his congregation. Somehow or
another he was discovered doing this by some of the elders of the church.
Anyway, they hanged him over his pulpit with his bible opened up to the previous
week's sermon. Then they closed the church and the lady was ran from town,
never to be heard of again. According to the story, that is the reason for the
heavy bible. I, personally won't go near the church, but I know people who
have. There is also a church in the town of </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">Oglethorpe</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;"> that is believed to have a ghost in it. The </span><st1:place><st1:PlaceName><span style="font-family: Arial;">Methodist</span></st1:PlaceName><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span><st1:PlaceType><span style="font-family: Arial;">Church</span></st1:PlaceType></st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">. There are actually two ghosts that I have heard stories about, but the
one I can recollect and personally experienced was that back in the 1800's,
there was a grand wedding to take place and everyone was at the church.
Everyone, that is, but the groom. Story goes that a wheel broke on his buggy
and he fell over into the flint river and drown. So, when you go to the church
around </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="23"><span style="font-family: Arial;">11-2
 am</span></st1:time><span style="font-family: Arial;">, you can sit on the
street that faces the side of the church and watch the window. After a minute
or two, the curtain will pull back and you can see a figure in the window. It
is believed that the bride is waiting on her groom to appear. I'll let you know
when I get the story about the other one. There is also a house going towards </span><st1:place><st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;">Reynolds</span></st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;">, </span><st1:State><span style="font-family: Arial;">GA</span></st1:State></st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;"> from Oglethorpe that is haunted by a man who owed
money to the Mafia and sat up in hi living room awaiting the arrival of the man
who would be coming to kill him and he was shot multiple times in the back<span style="">&nbsp; </span>with a shotgun while sitting on his sofa. I
had a friend that lived in this house while we were in high school. We had
helped clean up the kitchen and sat up playing cards in the dining room. Before
we went to bed, we put the cards back in the box and put them in a drawer in
the kitchen. She told me that once we went to bed, that we shouldn't get back
up. Okay, admittedly, that was weird. Anyway, the next morning, the cards were
scattered all over the floor and table in the dining room and all of the cabinets
had been opened and all of the dishes scattered. Well, to my surprise, the mom
told me that this was not unusual for them. Well, I never went back. I hope
this has helped you. And whenever you are down this way, I hope you find all of
your ghosts. Oh, yeah, we too have an old asylum...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

anything. I would like to send you the pictures of our last quest to the same
grave yard too. With them I will tell you our stories that go along .<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I can send them via e-mail. I'll have to wait
for my husband to get home as I am still learning to use our computer and all
its systems.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The pictures were takin
with a digital cam and i cant explain them myself. My husband was leary of my
ghost hunting but now helps out by looking through the pictures with me to let
me know I really am seeing what Im seeing<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>and that i am not crazy. I would like a pros opinion so please contact
me. I will tell the stories now and lable them so when you get the picts you

were walking toward the back of the cemetary a hazy figure was standing behind
a tree . It was about 5 yards away. I pointed the cam and said " I see you
" and then took the pic. She seems to be smieling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>2. Man , Woman and Child<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We were walking up the hill and we
were the only people their and heard footsteps besides our own. Devin asked "
Mommy do you hear that?"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I heard it
as we were walking up the hill but I didnt no if Devin would freak out so when
she asked I told her "yes". We stopped in front of a bench and I told
her to sit down. We still heard them coming toward us . I told her I was going
o turn around and take a pic. After I took the pic we heard no more foot steps.
When I got home down loaded the picts and 3 images were there.That day we got
there at 2;00 in the after </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="12"><span style="font-family: Arial;">noon</span></st1:time><span style="font-family: Arial;">

like to show us if they were around and to give us a sign and let me take there
picture . Devin said " Mommy it feels like someones touching my leg. so i
stood and took a pic of her on the bench. In the lower left hand corner there
is an orb. 4. The Fog<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I asked again
about 5 minutes later if there was any with us and we got up and started
walking due east and about 5 yards from the bench i stopped<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and turned around and asked again. I Told the
spirits "Im not coming back here at mid night so if you want to be seen
now Show your self " I was looking though the digital screen and saw this
fog then looked with my naked eye at the same spot. I took a pic of were it was
coming from and it was on the pic but not in plain sight.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>5.

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">My husband of 21 yrs shot
himself after an illness that left no hope in his living more than a couple of
months longer. He was in pain and asked my forgiveness and asked others to take
care of me for him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">A psychic friend of mine
whom I only knew from online and knew nothing of my or my late<span style="">&nbsp; </span>husbands history, called me and told me that
my late husband was met by his father. She said he was resting now. I felt a
cold chill and then she asked me if I felt a chill and I had and then she told
me that was proof that it was true. She told me I would remarry after my next
birthday.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I did remarry after my next
birthday. On the 1 yr anniversary of my late husbands birthday, about 4 months
after his death, I had a vivid dream where he got up from a bed wearing
stripped pajamas and gave me a wordless hug. That night I also got a phone
call, and what I heard was the sound of static like I have never heard before
and I Knew it was my late husband. I have also had a vivid dream where my
mother came to me and gave me a hug. These vivid dreams are not ordinary and
for the record, I usually never remember dreaming! <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">First off, I was so relieved
to find your site! My experience with ghosts has been a very evil and wierd
one. It's been a few months; and I am just now able to fall asleep without
jumping at everything real OR not real. I have told friends and family about
the things that have happened; I even went to a church to get help. However all
I "get" is,"you've lost it", "you're freaking me out,
shut up".; and at the church they looked at me like I was crazy and said
they could'nt help in that area. My paranormal experience started out in
catlike animals in the old apt. I was staying in with a friend.When I actually
saw this thing it was black and spongie,round in shape.I actually stepped on it
when backing up in the living room and thought I had accidently stepped on my
friends cat only to see her sound asleep in the kitchen.I later saw a teenage
boy in the living room sitting on a chair right in front of me- the chair was
always across the room in a corner. I had fallen asleep on the couch that night
and tossed to roll over only to be frightened half to death by this kid staring
at me! Out of fear I pretended not to be awake for I thought maybe some
"punk" had broken in and was going to hurt me when I awoke. I was
always alone whenever any occurences happened. This thing also followed me to
other locations.He, she, whatever, was also perverted! I was grabbed on the
rear twice- no one else was in the apt. Heard cat noises- not from the real
cat.A sexual "mmmmmmm" while undressing on one occasion.Poked from
behind once while downtown on my shoulder only to quickly turn around to see
nobody near to me.That particular day this thing had been bothering me all day.
I often woke up with strange looking cat scratches on my body- but didn't feel
a thing during the night.There are so many other inciden s, but I'd like to
talk to someone first before writting my full story- it's rather long.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Hi and thanks for listening
to my story.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">My name Is Russ Im 23. Im
Australian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I grew up in a west
Australian suburb call Hilton it was mainly old pre ww2 weather board house,
the kind that were made for low income families. My family (Mum, Dad and My
younger brother Andrew) moved there when i was about 3. there was lots of cold
places especially in our play room and in the lounge room. things started
happening when i was 4. The first thing I remember was being in bed at night my
dog Jesse would sleep under the covers at the end of the bed she started to
growl. thats when i heard my name being said like someone was whispering it and
a lot of swirly mist twirling around the ceiling. I was really scared so i hid
under the covers till I eventually fell asleep. The sightings changed after
that night to an old lady in a floral dress who used to stand in the door way
and look into the room at night. She always looked the same but I can never
remember her face. some times I would awake to jesse growling and the old lady
would be standing over my bed if I tryed to ignore her so nights it would feel
like she was grabing my wrists and shaking me a little her hands would feel
like a freezer burn on my skin. but she wasnt the only thing in the house.
Little red things that you could see out of the corner of your eye would move
around in the lounge room at night and sometimes in the early morning and there
would always be whispering noises when they were around. there was never
anymore then 3 of them at a time. we move out when i was 8. Ive driven past the
old house a few times it still scares the crap out of me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The story that I am about to
tell you happened to my boyfriend and I a couple of months ago.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well, I moved in to this house about a year
ago to live with my boyfriend.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My boyfriend's
dad actually owns the house and he had it build only about 30 years ago.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anyways,<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>his cousin and his wife lived up stairs until just about a couple of
months ago.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We live downstairs, it's
actually like a renovated basement appartment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To get to the point, after his cousin's moved out and everything was
pretty much cleaned out upstairs, my boyfriend and I decided to take a bath up
stairs one night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We only have a shower
in our appartment so we were kindof excited to be able to take a bath.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was about </span><st1:time minute="30" hour="2"><span style="font-family: Arial;">2:30a.m.</span></st1:time><span style="font-family: Arial;">, which we are always awake at that time, when we
finally got into the bath.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We decided to
take our dog, Irie, upstairs with us so he wouldn't be by himself, plus I feel
safer with him around.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were only in the
tub for about 10 minutes when we heard the first noise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Someone, actually something, was walking up
the stairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We knew there was somebody
there because every time someone walks up the stairs, they creek.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We heard someone walk up the stairs and then
we heard them walking around, we actually heard footsteps, walking over into the
living room and back again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My boyfriend
jumped out of the tub and threw his clothes on because we both thought that it
was his dad or his causin coming up to get something, and we weren't about to
have them catch us like this.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I sat in
the tub and waited as him and Irie left the bathroom to see what was going
on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>About 2 or 3 minutes later, when my
boyfriend came back in, I asked him who it was and he just looked at me and
said there's no one out there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I started
to freak out, I know that I heard someone walking around, and he heard it
too.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I jumped out of the tub, got
dressed, and ran downstairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I couldn't
believe what just happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nothing like
that ever happened to me before, I mean, I didn't even believe in ghosts until
that night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When we got back down stairs
my boyfriend ran to the front door just to make sure that there weren't any
cars out there, but there wasn't.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
he came back in I remember standing in the kitchen, I was leaning against the sink
shaking, and he was leaning against the stove, when all of a sudden we both
heard a loud thud upstairs, like someone jumped or stomped on the floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My boyfriend ran back over to the stairs and
yelled up stairs for whoever of whatever it was to cut the shit, and that he
was sending his pit bull up there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well
he tried to send Irie up stairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now
Irie was all excited and barking because his daddy was getting him all riled up
telling him "go get um", but Irie got half way up the stairs, stoped,
then ran back down.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now let me tell you,
that dog is afraid of nothing, but something was stopping him from going all
the way up the stairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ever since that
night, I have been a believer in the supernatural, I know that there was
something up there, no matter what anyone says about it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since that night we have had a couple more
occurances where we heard walking around, but no one was up there after we
checked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It hasn't happened in a while
now, knock on wood, but i know that whatever it was is still up there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After talking to my boyfriend about the
occurance, i found out that his grandmother was sick with cancer and had come
to live with him and his parents when he was a child.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately she had passed away in this
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only other thing that we
could think of is that our house is located around where the King Philip's War
and the Great Swamp Massacre occured.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Well I hope that you guys enjoyed my supernatural encounter, because i
sure didn't.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">This story was told to me by
my mother in-law. The story all begain with her mother. she was in her ninties
when she passed away and that was 2 years ago. Before she passed away she was
bed riden and my mother in law was the only one taking care of her. One day she
walked into her mother's room and to her suprise she had here arm up in the air
like she was reaching for something that wasn't there. She told me that she had
her arm up in the air for more than 20 min. Which at her old age was extremly
hard and painful for her to do but for some reason she didn't seem to be in
pain<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So my mother in law asked her what
is she doing and she replyed that she was reaching for the angel she asked if
she saw it and my mother in law replied that she didn't see anything there. A
few weeks past and my mother in law entered into her mothers room. When she got
in the whole room smelled like roses. This confused her because she didn't know
where the smell was coming from. Her mother wasn't allowed to use lotion or
soap with any kind of perfume in it because her skin was extremly sensative due
to her old age. She told me that her mother loved roses and she told her when
she passed away she wanted roses at her funeral. Couple of weeks past and she
passed away. Soon after she started to tell me stories of what was going on in
her house. The first storie she told me was that of my husband's friends who
had gone to visit her. She recalls 2 of them sitting on the sofa watching tv
while she was in the kitchen making dinner. The sofa was right next to the
stairs. While in the kitchen she heard them get up and slammed the door. So she
went to check to see what was going on and as soon as she opened the door they
screamed out"we just saw your mom walking up the stairs". Ever since
then they refuse to go back inside the house. Soon after that her neighbor
asked her if she could watch her 10 yr old daughter while she went out. she was
making lunch for the little girl and when she returned the girl was pale as a
"ghost". Worried something was wrong with the girl she asked her if
she was okay the little girl replied that she had just seen her mother walking
up the stairs. That was the last time anybody ever saw my mother in law's
mother. I guess when you're gone your not really gone at all. My mother in-law
tells me she feels safe because she knows her mom is around to watch over her.
She also said she knows her mom's spirit is happy because she could walk again
something she couldn't do for a long time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Hi, my name is </span><st1:PersonName><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Denise </span></st1:PersonName><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">and I am 31 years old.&nbsp;I was reading
the stories on your website&nbsp;and I wanted to share some things that have
happened to me and my family, and also a few close family friends in my moms
house.&nbsp;First let me start by saying these stories are very much
true.&nbsp;'"ll give you a little background.&nbsp;My mom and dad bought
our house in 1975 when my little sister Laurie was born. My brother Darren is 4
years older then me and me and I am 1year and 4days older than Laurie (she is
the baby of the family). Anyways for as long as I can remember (when I was 4 or
so), I have always thought our house was haunted. I don't recall ever seeing or
even hearing things that young but I always felt like something would sometimes
be watching us kids in our playroom. Now this house is a very big, 2 stories,
&nbsp;with a basement. At that time it was a 3 bedroom, 1 full bath and 2 half
baths.The basement was my dads party room complete with a bar he built himself,
a pooltable and a gorgeous fireplace that takes up almost one whole wall. This
is also where the laundry room is. Our playroom was on the main floor (now my
moms room) along with a huge living room, dinning room, kitchen and the full
bath. Too get to the playroom you go to a doorway across from the front door
that is the entrance to a hallway (not very long) which has the door leading
upstairs on the left , and turning right led down the hallway, the bathroom
door is in the middle on the left and at the end is moms room (formerly the
playroom). My brother and me shared the smaller room, but it&nbsp;still
was&nbsp;good sized room upstairs on the righthand side of the landing (bath
room in middle) with our parents and sister in the much larger bedroom across
the landing on the lefthand side. Both rooms have huge walk-in closets, and I
remember always being afraid of the closet in our room but the other closet in
my parents room did not scare me at all. I wouldn't go to sleep unless the door
was firmly closed and latched and I still do. Eventually my mom divorced my dad
because he was and still is an alcoholic and was very abusive to my mom, but he
never hit us kids. But we did witness a lot of the beatings he gave to our mom,
and it was a horrible scaring environment for us children especially for my
brother who remembers a lot more then me and my sister did because he was the
oldest. Anyway,&nbsp;mom took us kids and left. She filed for divorce and we
moved to </span><st1:place><st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Vancouver</span></st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">, </span><st1:State><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Washington</span></st1:State></st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"> while they battled it out in court. Dad
still lived in the house which is located in </span><st1:place><st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">North Portland</span></st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">, </span><st1:State><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Oregon</span></st1:State></st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">. Eventually mom won the house, the kids,
and our dog Tobby, but we lived in Washington for about a year with our mom,
and her soon to be husband, Butch, (who was a real jerk)and his son my stepbrother
Woody. When we moved back to the house I was about 7, Darren was 11, Laurie was
6, and Woody was&nbsp;7. My mom and Butch made the playroom into their bedroom
on the main floor. My sister and I had the 2 upstairs rooms. I took my parents
old room and Laurie got the creepy room across the landing from me. My mom had
2 bedrooms build in the basement for my brothers. At first I didn't feel the
presence in the house when we moved back and I kinda forgot about my childhood
fears but when I was about 12 or 13, I often would stay home alone while my mom
and step dad went out. My &nbsp;brothers and sister were staying at a friends
house and I knew I was the only one in the house and&nbsp;I would hear what
sounded like footsteps or someone walking around upstairs in my sisters room.
At first I thought my ears were playing tricks on me or the house was just
settling but a&nbsp;lot of times I would grab one of my brothers baseball bats
and walked to the door that led upstairs and I could clearly hear what sounded
like someone upstairs, I opened the door to go up and the noise would suddenly
stop. Of course that freaked me out pretty bad.&nbsp; After that, I decided to
call a friend who lived a block away and told her what had happened and she
told me I was crazy and laughed at me.&nbsp; But as I was on the phone with her
I heard a door shutting in the basement and I knew that I had to go down as I
had laundry in the dryer, with my bat in one hand and phone in the other to
check the noise.&nbsp; When I got downstairs, knowing that I had left the door
open, to my surprise it was shut and no one was in the house!&nbsp; Now, I
decided to go to my friends house cause now I was scared but I had to wait for
my laundry to dry.&nbsp; So, I again, left the door opened and went back
upstairs.&nbsp; I waited about 20 minutes, still on the phone with my friend, I
heard another door slam shut downstairs.&nbsp; I proceeded to go back to the
laundry room and found the door shut that I knew I had left opened not 20
minutes earlier.&nbsp; I then quickly grabbed my clothes, left mom a note and
got the hell out of this house!!&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">As I got older,
I didn't hear all the banging noises much but I did hear them
occasionally.&nbsp; Of course, my mom thought I was crazy and told me to stop
smoking the "wacky tobacco"!!!&nbsp; Then when I was 17, I brought my
son Chris home from the hospital, that is when I started to hear it walk across
the landing upstairs from my sisters room to my room, open the door and walk
around my bed, and it messed with a clock radio that I had on my headboard, it
would turn up the volume and change my station to static.&nbsp; Then it would
walk back around the bed and sit in the rocking chair next to my sons crib or
it would stand next to the bed, and&nbsp;it felt cold and like someone was
watching me.&nbsp; I would never open my eyes as I was afraid of what I would
see and after a few minutes it would walk out my door and towards my sisters
room.&nbsp; The next morning, I would wake up with my sister in my bed next to
me. Of course, she would say she didn't think there was anything or anyone in
the house but she wouldn't sleep in her room unless I was home and 99%, she
always ended up in my bed!&nbsp; At least 2 or 3 times a week I would encounter
the same thing with this person.&nbsp; One night, me being a new mom and very
tired, it&nbsp;was walking around, messing with my radio and I got irritated
and told it "Stop It!", and it suddenly stopped.&nbsp; Up until I was
21, I still heard footsteps going up and down the stairs with the normal visits
to my room.&nbsp; But after I told it to stop, it didn't seem to come around my
room anymore.&nbsp; I moved out after that.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">At the age of
26, I ended up moving back into this house with&nbsp;my daughter&nbsp;and ended
up with my sisters old room, the one across from mine when we were kids.&nbsp;
My daughters bed was pretty much next to mine and one night I awoke to my
daughter clinging to me in my bed, telling me that she had seen an old man
standing at the foot of her bed watching.&nbsp; My daughter, who was 3 at the
time, was able to tell me what he looked like and what he was wearing.&nbsp; As
I said earlier, I always had to have the closet door closed and latched in that
room but when I looked at the closet door that I had shut and latched before
going to bed was opened.&nbsp; Needless to say, my daughter never did sleep in
her bed while staying in that room.&nbsp; A few weeks after that incident, she
had went to her dads for the weekend, I had fallen asleep with my t.v. on and I
woke out of a dead sleep from a feeling of someone watching me and I looked
toward the t.v., I saw that same man my daughter described to me, standing in
the middle of my room.&nbsp; I crawled to the end of my bed to turn on the
light and&nbsp;he was gone.&nbsp; But guess what...that damn closet door I had
closed and latched before going to be was once again opened!!!&nbsp; After
that, I slept on the couch for remaining&nbsp;two weeks I was in that house.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">During the times
that I had moved out of the house, my mom or my brother would rent out the
rooms in the basement to close friends, naming a couple people, Christina and
Virgil. These two, I am sure rented the basement the longest, as my mom was
always quick to take in some strays of the streets of </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Portland</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">, literally!! Anyway, Christina has told
us that in the first couple years of living here, she would be in her room
downstairs and since her bed was by the door, she would be sitting in bed and
out of the corner of her eye, she often saw shadows of someone walking
downstairs, down past the bar and off to the laundry room.&nbsp; She would
always turn her head to look and no one was there.&nbsp; There was another time
that she had went upstairs, leaving her door cracked open.&nbsp; After a few
minutes, she had went back downstairs and her door was shut. When she tried to
open it, it would not budge as something was blocking it.&nbsp; She got a
little irritated and starting shoving her door kinda hard and come to find out,
her little dresser that was placed at least 10 inches away from her door and on
the same wall had moved itself about 1 1/2 inches in front of her door causing
it not to open?&nbsp; It must have been her cat!!!&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, she had
moved out and of course like me, moved back in a year later with her daughter
Chaie, she said that there were times she saw that same shadow, and also
started hearing her daughters toys, the ones that need our fingers to push
start, all of a sudden go off.&nbsp; This didn't just go off once at a time, it
played the tunes or whatever for at least a minute or so.&nbsp; Once again, my
mom thought we were smoking "wacky tobacco".&nbsp; Just wait, she
will smoke hers too!<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Our other
roommate, Virgil, had the room next to Christina, said that one day he was
sitting in his room with the door open, not knowing Christina wasn't here,
thought she had just came home.&nbsp; He said that he had heard someone walk
down the steps, he called out to Christina and when no answer, he sat up out of
bed just in time to see a dark shadow move past the door and he jumped out of
bed to watch it move past the bar and to the laundry room.&nbsp; Still thinking
it was Christina, he walked in to the laundry to find no one there.&nbsp; He
then knocked on Christina's door and got no answer, then he went upstairs to
see if anyone was home only to find that he was alone or was he?<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Just before I
had moved once again back home, Christina had told me that my mother who was
always a non-believer, told her that one day when my mother was laying on the
couch in the livingroom, knowing&nbsp;she was the only one home, heard what
seemed to be someone walking around upstairs, back and forth.&nbsp; Also that
when she was in her bedroom late at night, she started to hear someone banging
on her wall from outside, and that it was going from one side to the
other.&nbsp; She then said she got the gun out cause it sounded like a real
person was out there.&nbsp;&nbsp;But like all the others, no one was there
either.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Now, I have
moved back into this house and&nbsp;have the basement which is now converted
into a apartment with my two daughters, Allie (was 3 now 7) and Rayannah
(1).&nbsp; Allie can still remember the old man she had seen standing at the
end of her bed.&nbsp; Sometimes she gets scared when I leave her downstairs
alone, but I reassure her there is nothing to be afraid of.&nbsp; But still to
this day, we all have our stories of the person or persons still roaming this
house and know that he or she is not here to harm us, they just haven't found
the light to guide them to the other side........</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana; color: black;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">One night after work, I
picked up my friend Ryan to take some funky picture that we needed for an art
project. We went to various sites around the area and took beautiful pictures
of the lake, sunset, and train tracks. I remebered that there was an old jewish
cemetary up on a hill in are little central pa town. The cemetary had a really
cool fence and really awesome pictures views of the mountians surrounding us.
As we walked through the cemetary taking various picture, a weird vibe was
running through me and ryan's bodies. We qucikly decided to leave. As we reach
the car, we both heard a horifying scream comming from the open gates of the
cemetary. We stood there in fear and listen for more noises. Shortly after, we
heard screams from a baby. We got into my car and quickly left. As we left, we
both looked back and saw hands eaching out of the gate. We were so scared that
we went and sat on my porch all night long and telling all are friends about
it. The scare doesn't even stop there. After we got at pictures develope, a man
was standing in ripped closed with a shaven head in everyone of are photographs
(he looked like he was in the holocaust).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was truly phenomonal and probably the most haunting thing that will
ever happen!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">September 4, 2004<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The women on my mom&#8217;s side
of the family have been able to tap into and/or be given messages from the
other side.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Some have dreams of births
and deaths.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Some get feelings or just
have very good feminine intuition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
sometimes have feelings and interpretations of my intuition that I share with
my husband and daughters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But my
youngest daughter quite often has much to tell the family of her interactions
with those from the other side. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>(Her
experiences with the spirit world are abundant are better shared later.)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her older sister listens with interest but
only has rare happenings with the other side to share.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">My older daughter (9) was
very excited because last night she saw what she interpreted to be angels.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While she was swimming in the pool just
after eight o&#8217;clock she saw gold stars in the back yard and in the trees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(They were not lightning bugs.)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There were small gold lights floating
around.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The gold lights had small rays
like the stars in the night sky.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
lights that were close were larger than those in the trees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lights were moving slowly around but
mostly seemed to be going up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She felt
very special after seeing what seemed a supernatural event.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now she had an odd occurrence to share with
the family.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She talked about it with
her younger sister and they decided that the gold lights must have been angels.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">My older daughter shared her
story of the gold lights this morning while we were sitting in the living
room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On most days I probably would have
dismissed this story of the gold stars as the effects of chlorine in her eyes
as she had looked at the lights in the darkening evening sky.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But I too had seen odd things in the back yard
the evening before.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">My husband and daughters
were asleep by ten o&#8217;clock last night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
didn&#8217;t want to go to bed so I continued playing computer games.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had purchased a new computer CD with 100&#8217;s
of games on it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I tried out some new
games that I hadn&#8217;t played yet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
hours passed quickly as I worked out puzzles and tried to beat the clock on
other games.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Around one o&#8217;clock I
decided that I needed to quit playing and go to bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I took the dogs to the back yard for a
bathroom break.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As I walked into the
back yard everything seemed hazy or almost a bit fogy in the yard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I just guessed that what seemed like blurry
vision was because I had been playing games and looking at a bright computer
screen for hours, and now I was in the dark with the moon nearing its half
phase.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then in the haze I saw gold
lights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lights were saucer sized and
had the clarity and color of amber.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Small rays extended from the spheres.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I thought that I must be really tired since I was seeing spots in front
of me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I am now at the point in my
life that I have had to start using reading glasses to help me with the words
in the newspapers and books.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My hazy
vision and seeing spots made me a bit sad because I thought that I might also
be starting to have problems with my night vision. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">When I looked at the lights
of downtown about three miles away the sky was clear and the downtown building
city lights were crisp and distinct.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
difference in the clear distant lights and what I was seeing in my own hazy
back yard was very odd.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I decided that I
must have just stayed up way too late playing games on the bright computer
screen and went to bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">This morning started as a
lazy Saturday morning that was great for sitting around a bit and watching some
TV.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My daughter shared her story of the
gold stars the night before.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I listened
to her story with interest in her details.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I then told her that I too had seen the gold lights in the back yard
three hours later. I believe her about the lights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Perhaps they were angels.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">September 1, 2005<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I wrote this story about a
year ago (the day after it happened).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
have had many odd happenings and stories to tell.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is one of my favorite personal creepy
stories because someone other than me shared the same unusual experience.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Over the years I have noticed that sometimes
when strange things happen three days later something very bad happens like an
accident or a death. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">A few months after my
daughter and I had seen the gold stars I started to wonder if my uncle had
passed away near the sightings of the gold stars.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I found and read his funeral memorial
pamphlet that had been put away in the memory box.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I pimpled all over with chills as I read his
memorial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had died three days after
we had seen the gold stars.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">My daughters might have been
right.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Maybe the gold stars really were
angels.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Angels coming to take my uncle
home.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Couldn't help but come
across your site-and I wasn't too surprised! Montanna has alot of er...old
mountain feeling, and buddies and I have often come across stuff that isn't too
normal. Here's a few things we've found.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Just north of </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">Florence</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;">, Montanna is what appears to be a ghost truck. We've
heard it more often than we've ever seen it, coming down a long driveway, but
by the time we get outside, it isn't there. It's come at night and at day.
Other friends in the area have said they've seen the same thing. It's frequent
enough to be pretty creepy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">As for the 'Ghost George' in
the Missoula Childrens Theatre, another friend, 'Eek' and I have both had some experience
with it. He seems quite benevolent.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Now the creme of the crop,
so to speak, is my own house-don't scoff yet please! It's in the university
neighborhood, and we bought it about five years ago. It's a historic house,
being one of the first built in the university (dated ~1880-90). Doors slam
without notice even when there isn't the slightest of breezes. There will be
times at night when my own bathroom door won't open to tugging till I state my
'needs'. Lights go on and off, though the wireing is well maintained.
Electronics malfunction regularly in my room, and there has been one incedent
of an EVP nature on my computer (also in my room). But later the computer scan
ran clear. Drawers will open and close, things will get knocked off of shelves
quite suddenly, and footsteps can be heard on the second story hallway (outside
my room).<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The history of my house is
that the man who built it lived in it for about 60 years. His son was born in
my room, though I am not totally sure if he died in the house. The more often I
leave electronics running in my room, the greater the likelyhood of something
happening. The house is near the </span><st1:Street><st1:address><span style="font-family: Arial;">Hilda-Eddy Avenue</span></st1:address></st1:Street><span style="font-family: Arial;"> intersection in the University area.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Anyways, don't know if
that's usefull or even interesting, but hey!<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">After reading several dozen
stories, I guess I won't feel so out of place putting mine up. I'll only talk
about one house that I lived in from the time I was fourteen until twenty-one.
Rumor had it that the neighborhood was built on Indian burial grounds. This was
in </span><st1:place><st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;">Marlton</span></st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span><st1:State><span style="font-family: Arial;">NJ</span></st1:State></st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">, and is well known for the Lenapee and Cherokee
tribes that occupied the area long ago. I know, sounds like a fish story
already. Just bear with me for a few.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The first thing that I
remember was when I was sleeping in my waterbed when something, or someone that
had a hold of my legs and was shaking vigorously awakened me. My feet were
definitely off of the bed, and it felt as if someone had a hold around my
ankles. Scared the s!#@ out of me. Got out of the room pretty quickly. This
happened a few more times, but no one thought it was a ghost. My parents wanted
to take me to a specialist to see if I was having some sort of seizure. Never
brought it up again even though it happened again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Same house. My dog died
after 16 years. I had a friend of mine over from </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">Florida</span></st1:place></st1:State><span style="font-family: Arial;"> visiting. It was we two and my Mom in the house. We
were in my room, and my buddy was on the floor. My Mom was asleep down the hall
when we heard a trotting type of sound coming down the hall. We stopped talking
and both looked at the door. We heard a sound kind of like when a dog is
sniffing around and they huff out real fast. It was right under the door. It
did it two or three times and then we heard it trotting away. Us two tough guys
got up and locked the freaking door. Never heard it again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Same house. Same buddy was
over about a year later with another one of my friends. Big guy, kind of like
the missing link. Anyway, we were hanging out watching TV when I look over at
the missing link. He had a kind of freaked out look, and was just staring
towards my kitchen area. I asked what was wrong, and he said, "I didn't
know your dad was home". I said that he wasn't (business trip). He was
definitely spooked. He said he just saw a dark figure walk from the hallway
through the kitchen and just kind of disappeared in the dining room. He left,
another tough guy right?<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The mirror in the dining
room got everyone at some point or another. We had people just walk out of the
house shaking, and some crying. They would always see the dark figure walking
through the kitchen and into the dining room. It would always seem to melt into
the mirror, or maybe that is just the last place people saw a reflection last.
We have had doorknobs turning. Lights flickering, and even had one guy run
screaming from my brothers bedroom because he had seen an apparition in the
corner. He described it as featureless, but extremely bright. Supposedly it lit
up the room. He was pretty shaken, so I have a hard time believing he was
putting me on.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Well, that's about that. The
house has sold about five times in the last 12 years. I wonder what the other
people saw???<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I am a Sergeant in the
Military Police Corps. I am an Investigator stationed at </span><st1:place><st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;">Fort Sill</span></st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;">, </span><st1:State><span style="font-family: Arial;">OK</span></st1:State></st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">. I was looking on your sight and you only have one
sighting. Well I can tell you that the whole post is full of things that go
bump in the night. (And I do mean that latterly!) I can give you a few that I
know or have known people that I trust not to make them up. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The first is bldg. 475. It
is the old hospital when Geronimo was there. He died there from pneumonia. Back
in 1995 we had our arms room, where we keep all our weapons, down in the
basement. Well that is the old imbibing room. And right next to it was the old
morgue, then the supply room. Most of our armors would not stay down in the
arms room due to the repeated banging of pipes and attempting of opening of
doors.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">(Most of the doors had pad
locks on them and the locks would bang off the doors.) Most of the basement had
cold spots in AUG you know when it is 110 degrees outside. That bldg used to be
our barracks where I lived on the 2nd floor. There we saw multiple sightings of
things moving around. But due to the level of alcohol consumption most of them
were just dismissed. Only when we got new soldiers in that did not drink did we
start to think they were real ghosts.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">No one had any trouble with
them but they would scare the new soldiers out of there wits. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The next one is bldg. 913.
It is a barracks for one of the field artillery units. It was remolded a few
years ago so there was really no way to secure the bldg. Every few nights (were
talking about 5-6) we would get a call from one of the adjacent bldg saying there
were noises coming from 913. So we would send two (2) patrols to investigate
the noises. One patrol would start at the top using the back fire escape to get
to the top floor and the other would come up from the bottom floor. Now we
would hear noises on the floor above us and rush to track it down but could not
find anything. After about and hour of this fun, we call and got a few more
patrols to come help us search. We posted a man on every floor where a stair
case connected, with instructions to snatch anyone they see. We started to
search over from top to bottom this time and were still hearing noises. No one
went by the posted men and the noised were jumping floors.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">We finally checked it up to
ghosts and cleared the scene.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The third is Ambrosia Springs.
It is now a park but back in the 1800&#8217;s it was a sores of water. There is a
well that is back off in the back of the park that Maj Ambrosia an officer in
the engineer corps built. He was killed by Indians a few weeks after the well
was complete. He wife (I have never been able to find out her name) took her
life when she threw herself down the well. Now it is said that on full moons if
you look down into the well house (there is a great where you can see into the
well) you can see her face looking up at you. Now I have tried this and have
seen something that was not the same color as the water.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">What it was I don&#8217;t know. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The last one is Medicine
Bluff. It is believed to be a place of power in the area for the Indians. There
have been Indian chants and dancers seen on the bluff in full dress. By the
time we get up to the top. (No vehicles are allowed up on top so we have to go
in on<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">foot) there is nothing to
see. We have had patrols see then from down below and try to direct the other
patrols to them but they are gone before we can get to them. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I know of a few more but as
I said I can&#8217;t say for sure that they are accurate or that they have not been
made up. Hope these intrigue you.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
