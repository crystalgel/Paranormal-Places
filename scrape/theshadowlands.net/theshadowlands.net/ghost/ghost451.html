<span style="font-size: 14pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I lived in Noosa for a long
time, well i moved there as a child of about 4 years and left when i was 18.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Noosa is a kind of tourist
destination mostly populated by the wealthy.I have heard a few rumours of
covens of satanists on Mount Timbeerwah not only by christians but also but
pagan's and wiccans ( a wiccan who found her pet goat beheaded in her yard 3 days
after it went missing).Also the very much haunted 'Old Murdering creek
road'.Also rumors of kittens and dogs thrown off the mountain onto the barbed
wire and tree's below.Apparently this happens on fridays,saturdays or sundays.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Anyway what happened to me
has nothing to do with those cases but to do with the forest reserve that faces
the front of my previous house and home at 125 Butler street Tewantin (suburn
of Noosa).As a child ,i would often walk through the forest,there is a
boardwalk but i prefered roughing it in the bush, one particular day we found a
potato bag with a dead dog in it.During my late teens, i went through a phase
of the wiccan religion.One day i was chanting out in my garden,i never did it
again because i was chased into my house by something that i couldn't see.Late
one night i was dragged from my sleep by my arms,once again by something i
could not see.I have also witnessed a sugar jar move by itself and smash on the
ground when nothing was within 10 metre's of it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I suggest digging up info on
Noosa, because i want to know if anyone else has experienced this.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I now live in Brisbane,
apparently one of the most haunted places in Qld in possibly the most well
known gang neighborhood, sorry no haunting here yet :P<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I feel kinda funny telling
you these things because frankly most people don't understand and if you tell
them they get freaked out and don't understand. I moved to Goldenvalley
Aroizona almost 5 years ago and my 2nd night here i noticed some ligths out the
window that i can not discribe. They are and were the most brightist and
awahing thing you would ever see. I watched them for months on end lo and
behold I turned around one evening to look up into my light in my room and seen
the most hansom manlooking back at me with the most brilint smile you could
ever imagine. We had more encounters then I can name and at first I thought
this satan devil his self could of be behind this smile. They many of them
turned out after time to be the most heaven sent beings in my life. The talk to
me in their own way and always look out for me and give me more love in more
ways then people ever could. Theres never a item lost in my life thats
including me. If I am out in about they make sure what road Iam on I am never
lost I can't began to tell you all these spirits do for me. Ever where I look
they are there and always with a smile or a loving thought and always ready to
help. It was not always like that I had ti gain their trust.They have never
said where they are from.&lt;but do they need to? My life down here on earth is
to (as crazy as it may sound is to bring spirits from earth bound deminsions
and lower places back to god the loving Father) So therse spirits were right on
the money . <o:p></o:p></span></p>

any sports.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">At the south end of <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Hamburg</st1:place></st1:State> is a restaurant,
and along the south side of this restaurant is a dirt road.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This road goes for about 100 yards, curves
left, and then is straight for about four miles.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This road is where the "spook
light" (will o' wisp) resides.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At
first, I didn't believe, but I've been about 25 times, and there were only
about three times when I didn't see it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>One time in particular was extremely creepy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>About three miles down this road, the trees
get thicker, and you cross over two small wooden bridges.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is where you would normally see the
white-bluish light, just floating along through the ditch, and every now and
then crossing the road.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once you cross
the bridges, the trees open up, and Highway 52 is a about half a mile in front
of you, but there are rarely any people on it at night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was with my family looking for the light,
and we were heading towards Highway 52 (which means that for three miles behind
us, there is nothing) and we saw the light about 100 or so feet behind us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It started to cross the road, but stopped in
the middle, turned a reddish-orange, and started coming at us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We took off.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It got back in the ditch, turned bright red, and chased us to the end of
the trees, and we could still see it glimmering when we got to the highway.=<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">i was researching on google
for similar experiences and noted one story by someone that lived in the same
area as me in germany (hohne) a place where british army now lives which is
situated near bergen-belsen concentration camp and the camp itself was a place
the ss soldiers lived. I lived on camp in a flat from the ages of 6-9 so i dont
know much about the origins of the flat however something was not right with
it. It was the exact same desing as the rest on camp 3 floors with 2 flats on
each floor a cellar and an attic. Everyone elses flat had a cellar that could
be accessed from the front door and going down some stairs or from climbing
down ladders at the side of the flat on outside. Ours was different however
ours was different, when you opened the door to the stairs leading to the
cellar they had been CONCRETED over with a variety of old junk such as
lawnmowers belonging to nobody pilled on top, and on the outside instead of the
cellar there were two small rooms the one on the right hand side had chains
with cuffs at the end hanging from the wall with no way into the usual cellar
format of the other flats. Once in a while my parents would have a function
since my dad was in the army and i would stay at home watch tv go to bed ect.
However on a couple of nights i would make myself a drink or some toast and on
bringing it to my mouth my arm would freeze i could move rest of my body but
couldnt move my hand to my mouth. Also we were on the top floor for flats all
there was was the attic above us, however regularly i would hear running about,
banging and footsteps and whispering above me while lying in my bunk bed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">After reading some of the
stories on your site, I decided to share mine with everyone. And I'm so glad to
see that there are many people that have seen, heard, or had other experiences
with ghosts and spirits. That means I'm not crazy!<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Some coincidence, the year of
my experience was 1994. I was 28 and had just moved into an old farm house with
my three young children.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">One night while the children
were at their grandparents house, I kept hearing something that sounded like
footsteps upstairs. Of course, nothing was there that I could see. A few times
after that, I would hear the door in my livingroom open and close--I had a
couch infront of the door because I didn't use it!<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">One night, while sleeping, I
just woke up. Didn't know why, then I saw something move by my bedroom door. I
sat up and watched as an old woman, dressed in a white night gown with the
lilttle bonnets they used to wear, walked over to my bed and sat down at my
feet. I couldn't move! I just sat there and stared at her, then she was gone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The next day I went down the
road to a friends house and was telling her and her mom about what had
happened. I was then told that by the description of the old lady that it was
the old lady, Mrs. McNeil, who had owned the house. She and her husband had
both died there. He was upstairs when he passed away, which would explain the
footsteps. My friends mom said that Mrs. McNeil was a very freindly person and
she was probably just checking to see if I was friendly also. Maybe she was
welcoming me into their home!?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">When I was 19-years-old (I am
now 37) I lost my fiance' and the love of my life in an automobile accident in
September of 1990. I was deeply depressed and overcome by grief as we were so
very close and had planned our life together and he had recently put a
downpayment on a house (that he was going to surprise me with) according to his
mother. Anyway- New Year's eve a few months after his death, I had managed to
pull myself together to go out and have a drink at a local bar and ran into his
brother. I missed my fiance so much and felt like I should drive out to his
place to at least be near where he was (used to be) in my case. I went in his
room and laid down on his bed, I found some comfort in this strangely enough. I
then got up and went out on the porch. I was in the house alone as everyone was
out celebrating the New Year. I stood on the porch and it was so deathly quite
and was standing there crying grief striken because I missed him so much. Then
the wind started blowing, really blowing and I thought I heard someone call my
name.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I thought I was going crazy,
but then I heard it again and again. It scared me so bad that I bolted off of
the porch and got in my car and raced down the drive way. While I was driving
away, I felt in my heart that it had to be him trying to comfort me. I have
felt his presence on several occasions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">One night my friend, my mom
and i went to runyon park because we heard of the so called
"hauntings" but we mostly went to walk the trails. well we went there
around 1pm and we walkk up the hill to where the flag pole used to be, it was
raining really hard and it was humind, but when we were by the flag pole we all
got freezing cold. after that we went back and walked to the grave yard and we
took a video off of my phone. the video did not come out good it came out
really blurry and disturted there was glowing around the sight right night to
the grave yard. when we came closer to the grave stone on the far right we say
a dark figure laying down with its feet up against the gave stone. we ran out
of there and we were planning on leaving. so we went threw the main park and
stood on the bridge for a few minutes and suddenly we heard loud humming
(sounded like a female) it sounded like it was right in our ear. when we got to
the middle of the bridge the flowing water got really choppy and loud, it
started hitting hard agains the bridge. after we left a few nights later in my<span style="">&nbsp; </span>mom's room a burnt out light bulb had turned
on in the middle of the night at exactly 3am, and at 3:01am the night shut off
and didnt work again. we may have brought a spirit home, seeing that my friend
had yelled a very old looking shoe for a long time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">When I was a young, still in
grammar school, my family and I moved in with my mother's new husband in a
small but old house. The house had two floors, a ground floor and a full
basement. For about three years, the basement served as a play-room. It was
also used for storage and laundry because of a another walled off room, which
had a kind of cement closet attached. To be in that section of the basement was
to be totally seperated because the door to the room would always seem to be
shut even when my mother was doing laundry. She believed the door was old as
was the house and that old houses have quirks like that because of
re-adjusting. This all made perfect sense, and yet she always seemed to be
slightly frightned when the door would shut hard on it's own. It got to the
point where anyone that had to be in that room did whatever they had to do very
quickly and then got out in a hurry, especially at night. It was about two
years into living in this house that my sister and I would play a certain game
in the playroom at the same time every day. There were no clocks in the
basement, but it seemed like at a certain time (I think it must have been
around 4p.m.)my sister and I would get a sense of urgency to hide. When we hid,
we were silent because to be found was bad. The thing that searched for us
wasn't human, but it had a human form. It was a black mass in the shape of a
human, very definate in that it was there. It would crawl through a crack in
the laundry room door, the same door that would shut on it's own opened on it's
own just enough to let this thing through and then it would close again. Once
it got out, it would search for us. We always hid in the same places, places we
found were safe. I would hide under an old bed that was kept there to serve as
a couch or spare room for guests if need be. My sister hid in the toy chest
which was large enough to fit her inside and close the lid. She watched what
was happening through an enlarged hole in the front where a lock for the chest
used to be. We called this thing "The Sandman" because to be touched
by it was to have whatever part of your body touched to feel like it had
"fallen asleep". You know that slightly painful prickly feeling you
get in your feet if you sit a certain way for too long? When you were touched,
the feeling wouldn't go away until the sandman went back through the door.
Believe me when I say that I personally would go to great lengths not to be
touched, and whatever the thing was it didn't seem to have the ability to reach
any further than a human could. This went on for about a year befor our
play-room turned into my parents bed-room. They rebuilt the interior on that
half of the basement and put a lock on the laundry room door. I still am not
sure why they put a lock there, I don't recall being taken seriously about the
sandman or if we even told my mother. I have asked her if she remembers hearing
us tell her about it, but she has no memory of the thing in the basement. She
only remembers the door closing on it's own and admits that she hated to be
down there alone because she always felt like something was watching her while
she did laundry. This makes sense to me because I was always positive that
whatever it was we saw originated in the cement closet, which was directly
across from the washer and dryer. I don't remember even the adults being brave
enough to go into that closet, it was longer than it should have been and had a
dirt floor. There were no shelves, just an overhanging light and a wooden door
with a latch. That latch was always fastened and that door never opened on it's
own. I think if it had my mother very likely would have demanded that we move.
She was a skeptic but she was no fool and trusted her intution without a doubt.
I think that may have ultimately been the reason for the second lock. For years
after we left that house (we moved when I was about twelve) I would think back
on the year of the sandman and wonder if there was some explanation. I
considered that maybe I had created a game and my sister went along just to
play with her older sister. I can clearly remember seeing the thing, and the
feeling of it touching me, but my logic tried to determine a more reasonable
explanation. A game made up by a kid with a very active imagination made sense.
That's all I believed it was until years later, when my sister and I were
adults. One day for no real reason, she asked me if I remembered the sandman
and the play-room in the basement. We talked about what we remembered and she
explained for the first time what she would see happen through the hole in the
chest. About the black shadow of a thing she saw the same time everyday crawl
through the laundry room door. Being as she was completely enclosed she had no
memory of the feeling of being touched, just of seeing the thing searching and
going back into the laundry room. When I told her what it felt like, she
suprised me by saying that explains why she remembers me crying sometimes after
the thing was gone and she crawled out of the chest. I spent a long time trying
to believe it was something I made up as a kid despite my vivid memory of the
sandman. Now I believe there was something very real in that house,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and I'm not the only one.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>- - - I was 16 years old when I saw a ghost. I
had always believed in the paranormal because I came from a family who was,
well, "sensitive" to the paranormal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My great-grandmother was a psychic and a tea leaf reader, my grandfather
had many paranormal experiences throughout his life and my mother is also a
believer with many stories of her own.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Maybe having this unwavering acceptance of ghosts, etc made me more
likely to see a ghost but whatever anyone else says, I know this was real - so
here goes....<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I was sleeping very soundly
one summer night and suddenly I was awakened.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I don't know how or why but I was wide awake and fully conscious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was on my side facing the wall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I laid there a few minutes trying to go back
to sleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Feeling uncomfortable,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I rolled over to my other side and that's
when I saw him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had left my closet
doors open after deciding what to wear the next day and standing just inside my
closet was a little boy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I saw him VERY
clearly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was about 8 to 10 years old,
he was wearing dark colored shoes, greenish colored tweed knickers (those old
fashioned short pants that button just below the knees), a cream colored shirt
with suspenders, and a tweed newspaper boy hat.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He was just standing there with his arms at his side and no expression
on his face.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He looked just like the
kids you see in those old movies who are selling the newspapers on the
corner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even though I was a
believer,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>seeing this so clearly stunned
me and my first reaction was to cover my face.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After I composed myself and worked up the courage, I looked again and he
was gone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I never saw him again and, in
fact,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>have never seen another ghost
again but I have<span style="">&nbsp; </span>had other paranormal
experiences.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I will be submitting my
other story soon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is about the many
unusual experiences I had living in the first house my hubby and I bought.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I no longer live there but I will never
forget living there!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If you are
interested in reading it I plan to title it "The Haunted House on Mine
Hill".<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">This tale is a tale of two
houses both connected by the same spirits. The first house, has multiple sprits
and an uneasy feeling when you have been in that house for a while. My husband
and I were always wondering why people would move in and out of the house next
door, now we know why.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The last set of neigbors were
really nice people who had a child.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One
night as I was taking the dogs out they had some of their belongings and were
rushing to the car.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I asked them what
was wrong and they said that they felt and eerie presence and say a woman in
the mirror. The friend that was there with them said that he could see
spirits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She wasn't evil but there were
other ghosts in that house that gave him the chills.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Like I said I didn't believe them. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I didn't know what to expect.
I thought they were full of it, but too many things have happened. As it turned
out a woman and her family lived in that house in the 1800's. The woman died
there on September 17th and her son and husband moved into the house next door.
Our house. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I talked to the friend who
can see the spirits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He said that she
keeps looking out the front window of her house to look at ours. He also told
me that the son and husband who moved next door also died in that house. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Thinking back of all of the
wierd things that have happened in our house when my husband's sister and her
kids were here.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The kids would be afraid
to go in the attic because they saw "demons".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not to mention lights going on and off by
themselves and the feeling of being watched all the time. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I asked if was possible if
she was trying to get back together with her family and he said it was a good
possibility.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Then that night the most
horrible experience happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It sounded
as if someone was trying to break into our house. The banging noise from
downstairs made my husband and his brother go get the gun and a bat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They went downstairs and said that the noise
was coming from the furnace room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
opened the door and immediately the noise stopped and they felt a cold draft.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Either she came over here and
got trapped or one of them got stuck in that room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Now I get the creeps when I
am downstairs and I refuse to go into the house next door because I know that
they have something evil in the basement of their house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have heard it and felt all jittery and
anxious to get out of that house before something bad happens.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I never really believed in
this stuff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was more of a if I don't
see it, it doesn't exist. Boy was I wrong, there are some things that are
better off not being known.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I was stationed at K.I.
Sawyer AFB in northern <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Michigan</st1:place></st1:State>
from 1984-1989.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was a security
policeman charged with keeping a watchful eye on our nation's military
resources.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nightshift duty could be a
spooky experience, depending on where you were posted. During my time there, I
had several experiences that I can't explain. The most prominent was the night
I was posted at 29A. This guard's job was to watch an opening in the fenceline
where the alert fighter jets would taxi out of in case of a response. It was a
great post during the daylight, but got darn right freaky at night! Especially
because you were alone. The midnight shift was dragging on as usual. I was
sitting in the glass encased guardshack scanning the two fencelines when on the
north fenceline I came upon a ghost. It was "walking" east next to
the fence. The apparition was semi-transparent, white if you had to give it a
color. I could see the fence on the other side of the ghost. In the few seconds
it took for me to comprehend what I was seeing, I did notice that it didn't
have any legs from the knee area down. I grabbed my rifle and radio and got out
of the shack. It was gone that quick. I thought about calling my control
center, but what was I going to report? I'd be the laughing stock of the men I
worked with.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I later learned that many
years before I was stationed there, two policeman in that area were having a
quick draw contest with their handguns. One guard accidentally shot and killed
the other. Maybe it was the ghost of the DEAD COP?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I never saw it again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">you may not believe me but i
had two encounters with ghosts I live in MI and when I was 11 me and my parents
bought a new house. a couple months later when we finnaly placed everything
where it goes it started. i was getting up for school after my dad woke me up I
shut my door to get ready and when i was about to leave my room i shut off my
light before i opened my door(i wouldnt have done that saying i was scared of
the dark then) I thought that my dad was in the kitchen with the light on out
there but turns out he wasnt so I opened the door and found the house was dark
and I suddeny saw this huge black figure run across the living room<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I knew it wasnt my mom or dad because my mom
was asleep and my dad was down stairs and I doidnt hear any footsteps so I
hurried and shut the door. when I came back out my dad was in the kithcen I
told him what I saw but he didnt believe me. To this day I think it was a ghost
. the other encounter was I was at the library with my friend we were online
and she claims to see a lady dressed in white go behind the book shelves. I
didnt think nothing of it because I thought it was just a lady dressed in white
I mean whats abnormal about that. 10 minutes later I saw the same lady dressed
in white Iam guessing she saw me because she went back behind the bookshelf so
me and my friend ran to the same shelf she went behind and no one was there at
first I thought she went out the back door so we checked all around the library
and all outside the library and couldnt find her. But what I found was as soon
as I went outside it turned suddelny freezing cold .<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>My brother use to live in one of those rooms
about five years ago. He tells me one time when he was lying on his bed
watching t.v., that the phone reciever on the wall across the room slowly
floated off the hook and settled on the table. My brother freaked and thought
he was loosing his mind! On another time when he returned to his room he
noticed the phone cord was ripped from the wall and a big mirror was moved from
the wall to the floor on the other side of the room. Another scary experience
he had was when he used the elevator to go to his room. When the elevator
opened he notice footprints imprinting onto the carpet leaving the elevator! My
brother was not alone on that elevator ride!! These ongoing experiences made
him stay in the lobby for several nights and eventually he moved out of there.

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Hi, My name is Christina,
When I read your story about the little creature you saw when you were 3, It made
the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. My daughter is 6yrs old, in 2005,
when she was 3 years old she started telling me that in the morning when i
would go outside to feed the animals she would see a little mas at the end of
the hallway, he wouldnt move but he woul call her and ask her to go play with
him in the livingroom, by herself she said he would tell her only her not her
brother who was 5 at the time. She never went because i know now, she felt
unsafe. She described his as being about 2ft tall with a beard, At night when
she would sleep, (she slept in the same bed as her brother) she would wake up
crying saying someone was on top of her, for a while we thought it was her
brother's arm or foot. Then we started watching her and staying up all night to
see what was going on, She would wake up screaming scared that something was
hitting her. At that time we had a little chihuahua and she would sleep with
me, ( we slept in the same room kids and us). At night Panchita (the chihuahua)
would wake up growling, and jumping to her bed and trying to climb the wall to
get to something, im sure she was protecting my daughter from whatever was
trying to hurt her. One day I sprayed holly water all over the little trailer
we lived in and raised my voice saying "leave this home, Leave us alone
and never return you cannot have my daughter leave her alone." She is
protected by god and by her parents." Never again did she say she saw
anything like that, we moved out to new home last year and she has been
fine,Just one incident, she and her older brther said they saw people (shadows)
walking in and out of their rooms, they didnt speak of go near them, the kids
thought we were having a party, which we werent, After that they have not had
any more incidents, I hope it's all over for them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Dreams<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I often have dreams where my
grandparents visit me. Just a couple of nights ago, I dreamt that I was talking
to my Grandma and my Great Grandma through this old fashion telephone. I don't
know a thing about my great grandparents, not even their names and in my dream,
my Great Grandma introduced herself to me as Mary, or Mary Ann, Marion I really
don't remember too well.... and out of curiosity, because my dream felt SO real
I emailed my dad and asked what my great grandparents names. He replies the
next day saying it was Mary. How cool is that?<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Another thing that happened
to me early this year. I don't what I saw was my Grandpa, my spirit guide, or a
ghost. I am in the military and we are down in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Georgia</st1:place></st1:country-region> doing some training. I have
a room to myself. This one night, I was listening to music on my iPod. I know I
was drifting off to sleep but I know I was conscious enough to see the music
selection on my ipod (I was trying to skip some songs I didn't want to listen
to on my play list). With the glow from my iPod, it looked as if some guy was
looking right over me, as if bending down to wake me up or something. It really
started me because at first I thought it was someone waking me up because we
were having a formation and I needed to be there but then I remembered, I had a
room to myself and no one has the key to my room. SO THAT started me awake. It
could have been my grandpa, because he wore glasses and whatever I saw had
glasses on because the ipod light reflected off of it. BUT the structure of the
persons face wasn't my grandpa unless it was a younger version of him AND this
was in the dark so I can't tell WHO it was. I don't believe it was a dream
because who dreams up stuff like that and not recognize the person? AND I could
still see the outlines of the furniture in the room and I know I was changing
the songs on my ipod... I wish I knew who it was that I saw.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">It all began after my first
son was born in Jan 1998. not long after my grandmother past away and about 6
yrs after my wifes dad had committed suicide. My wife and i were visiting my
grandparents often so my pap and gran could see there 2nd and only granchild
they could see normally due to my brothers problems with his ex wife. Like i
said not long after my gran had died we would still find jelly beans in her
favorite chair(which is where she always hid them from us boys so she could eat
her favorite candy while watching the news). Well my wife and i lived in the
country where my family always used to go but gran always stayed home after she
got older just to keep a eye on her house. my wife and i were in bed asleep
when my wife woke up and saw<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the closet
door which was maybe 2 ft from the edge of our bed open, and out walked a
little old woman/man with a walker, walked through our room and out the door to
the hallway. with my newborn baby on a heart monitor which is what originally
woke my wife, she jumped out of bed to check on the baby only about 3 ft from
our bed in the same room. this in turn woke me and as she began to tell me what
had happened i went back to sleep being i was working two jobs so she did not
have to work, and could stay home and raise our little boy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>when i returned from work that night around
12:00am<span style="">&nbsp; </span>she tryed to tell me about this
little old person who walked out of our closet, in a full size walker (the old
kind from about the 50's or 40's). i kind of laughed it off because she has
always told me stories of her and her family who have witnessed things of this
nature. after about a couple weeks or even a month she woke me scared to death
saying something about two people who were standing over my sons crib just
looking upon him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>i imediatly got up to
check on him to find she already moved him to our bed. this is how scared she
was. well the next day we talked about it again and after describing what she
saw i could only come to the conclusion that one of the people she had saw was
my grandmother she described her normal older farm dress to a T. and her mother
insisted that the desciption she had given of the other almost perfectly
described her dad years ago. after thinking about it for some time we had come
to the conclusion that her father just wanted to see his grandson he never got
to see, and that gran just wanted to see nicholas one last time. That we know
of.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>a couple of years<span style="">&nbsp; </span>later after my second son was born my wife
had caught my older boy now 4 talking to himself outside in the middle of the
day and when she asked who or what he was talking to or about he said nobody
mommy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>later that night he had aksed her
if she remember when she asked him that question and she had said yes. he had
replyed he was talking to "bucky". my wife suddenly got a cold chill
and asked him where he had heard that name and he said he told me. she kissed
him good night and ran to tell me what nicholas had been doing earlier and what
he said to her just a few minutes ago ( bucky was her fathers nickname). two
years later my youngest boy was about two and he was sitting in his bed one
evening while my wife was cleaning his room, and she noticed he was queitly
laughing to himself and looking at the other end of his room. when she said
something to him he laughed and waved bye towards the corner of the cielling.
when my wife asked brenden who he was waving and laughing at he simply said
"pap". she aked her where he went and he pointed up and said the sky.
again she ran to tell me that my son was laughing and waving bye to pap, and i
laughed saying he just has a small memory of him some how, and then she told me
it was brenden, who had never met my pap.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>not since then have we seen or to our knowledge my children seen any
thing of that nature.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Thank You.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Several years ago, I worked as a Security
Office and my first assignment was at SISEMAGRAPH, CORP.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had to turn on the outside security lights
and I had no idea how to do this. No one showed me and at dusk, I went to the
basement and tried to figure out which switches to flip. As I was studying the
system, I noticed out of the corner of my left eye a tall male figure. He
placed his right hand on my left shoulder and pointed with his left hand which
switches to flip. I did as he directed. I "thanked" him and left but
never went back down by myself. I mentioned this to my co-worker and she said
that at times when she was checking the floors, someone would walk on the back
of her shoes and take them off. This building was sold to BANK OF OKLAHOMA.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Also, I have worked in

  Plainfield</st1:City>, <st1:State w:st="on">New Jersey</st1:State></st1:place>
that used to creep me out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My parents
and I were the ones mostly tuned into things; my brothers never seemed to have
anything happen to them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anyway, one of
my first memories of that place was being asleep and waking up six feet above
the bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No joke.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I heard my mom call me from downstairs, I
woke up above my bed and came crashing down a heartbeat later onto my bed and
then I bounced to the floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My mom made
a comment about jumping on the bed but didn&#8217;t believe me when I told her what
happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My mom and dad also heard a
loud knocking on the front door late one night.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When they went to investigate the door was wide open and my folks both
contended that something bad had happened.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That was a Halloween night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
next day they found out that my aunt had her throat slashed by her crazy
husband.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Luckily, she survived.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The weird thing is that the exact same night
(the slashing made this stick in my mind) I had a nasty dream with what looked
like &#8220;The Grim Reaper.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was walking
down the stairs towards us in the living room.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It wanted to take one of us away.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I woke up terrified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It could be
I was sensing the same thing as my parents. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>The basement was naturally creepy and I think
it may have been a fear cage scenario, but I always swore that I could hear
shots being taken on the pool table when nobody was down there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I don&#8217;t know anything about the house&#8217;s
history.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I wish I did.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I think it might have an interesting one.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I also remember seeing my
brother&#8217;s doppelganger leaning at the edge of my bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I only knew it wasn&#8217;t my actual brother
because this doppelganger had huge, disc-like, glowing green eyes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Seriously, I remember that one clear as day
but I&#8217;m not convinced it was a spirit or ghost energy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I just can&#8217;t explain it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Possibly the most profound
experience I have had was when my grandfather died when I was 19.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The family was off doing something
funeral-related and I was left with my dog, Max.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had an instinct that &#8220;something&#8221; was going
to happen and I said out loud, &#8220;Grandpa, just don&#8217;t scare me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I&#8217;ll go crazy.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>About 20 minutes later Max was looking out
into the kitchen from one of the bedrooms and wagging his tail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I stooped down to pet him and said &#8220;Whatcha
see, buddy?&#8221; and when I looked up to where he was staring my grandfather&#8217;s form
was just disappearing in the doorway.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
was transparent and was wearing the same rumpled, grey pants I always knew him
to wear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I wasn&#8217;t scared by any
means.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I think I actually just stopped
in wonder for a second and smiled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
just couldn&#8217;t believe my dog had seen him first!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">My story starts out when i
little. My father help build his house and it was huge when your little and one
day i was in my room folding clothes and i heard someone whistling and i turn
around and saw a grown man's hand in the door way like coming up the stairs to
grab ahold of something and i thought is was my dad playing with me so i turn
back around finishing my chores and then i turn back to see if the hand was
still there and it was not. Then a few years later i was in my room trying to
fall asleep and i saw a black figure just stood and watch me and it walked slow
to the widow and vanish. But i was not afraid of these two things that happen
but what really scared me was about a week when i was little i saw a white
figure in the woods going back and fourth and coming closer and closer and i
knew that was something not to mess with and i ran to the house. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Not long after that happen
everything was quite and my parents got a divocre and i live with my mom and
after a while nothing out of the blue happen until I turn 17 then the weird
stuff happen again. my mom and i live in the woods and there are a few houses
around us and what was the weird thing is that i felt like someone is wacthing
me all the time and one night while my boyfriend was going home we both heard
someone throwing rocks at my kitchen widow. I was inside and he was at his car
and i went to ask him did throw a pebble or a rock at the kitchen widow and he
said no. we looked around and nothing was there. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Now at 18 i saw a little boy
with blode hair about the age of 2 outside of my living room window had his
back turn and ran to the back side of the house and this happen two or three
nights ago. so i will never know what will happen next.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

killed in a car accident when I was young about 3 or 4 yrs old we could hear
him in the kitchen...crashing the dishes walking threw the house you could hear
the foot steps or at least our mom and dad told us it was him every morning
when we got up our back door would be unlocked and<span style="">&nbsp; </span>standing open this went on until i was a teen
and it just stopped except for when my mom and I were standing in the kitchen
and we saw a large ball (orb) of mist floating across the yard by the time we
got out side to get a better look it was gone...one of my dads brothers came to
live with us he was dying (emphazemia)my sis and i would take care of him we

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">My sister Brittany and I had
just moved out to <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">California</st1:place></st1:State>.
We had just come from the movies with our boyfriends and decided to bring the
guys to our condo. Brittany and her boyfriend Kevin went into the kitchen to
talk and DAlvin and I sat on the couch and cuddled. After a few minutes Dalvin
and I fell asleep, and <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:State w:st="on">Brittany</st1:State></st1:place>
and Kevin were still in the kitchen when<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I woke up to Dalvin<span style="">&nbsp; </span>screaming
like a girl. I asked him what was wrong he told me that someone was strangling
him. I looked at his neck and found red handmarks. Brittany and Kevin where
quiet and I knew something was wrong. I walked in the door and Kevin and
Brittany were frozen in their place while looking into the hallway. There stood
a little girl with a rope around her neck. Her face was white with blood stains
all over. She gave all three of us an evil grin then disappeared. We all
decided to forget it but we did move to another condo. I still get chills
thinking about her. It was the scariest moment of all our lives.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My personal experience was my last
apartment I lived in. My first born was 2 years old and I seen my son looking
down the hallway, he looked for about 2minutes and then when we were leaving he
waived bye. I asked him who were you talking to he said "my friend".
I didn't think nothing of it. Another time it was 2:40am and I woke by the
sound of my son's toy sword. It only makes a noise when the sword is swung. I
heard it 3 more times, So I got up to see and the sword was standing straight
up against the wall. I was freaked out. A couple of nights later I was woke up
to another toy playing once again it was 2am, it kept playing so I went to see
about it. I had to look through his toy box and when I finally found it, it
turn itself off!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Another time I was
sleep on my back and I felt tapping on my feet, I thought it was my son but
nothing was there, that happened twice. I had another son and when he turned 1
1/2 years old He also looked down the hallway and waived bye to someone! I
MOVED OUT!!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">My Paranormal Encounters<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">By: t.kronstrom@comhem.se<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Everyone in my family firmly
believes that our house is haunted. We bought it from my grandmother after my
grandfather had died of cancer. Now, about my grandfather: He was very young
when he died about 55 years old and he also owned a plumbing company. We
believe that it is him and another old man who haunts the house.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The first paranormal
encounters in the house was minor, just a strange sensation on the upper floor,
kinda like someone was watching you. This sensation was magnified in my
brothers room where you always felt like you were being watched also, lights in
this room always behaves oddly and flicker or goes out at random times. I for
one, believes that it is the original owner who haunts that room for unknown
reasons. The most frightening encounters however, happened to me. About five
years ago I was trying(in vain) to fall asleep, the whole night I had been
twisting and turning and just couldn&#8217;t sleep. After some twisting and turning I
eventually turned to face my room, for some reason I opened my eyes and saw
something that scared the bejeesus out of me. A person, completely white but
with a pitch-black head stood besides my bed looking at me. I believe that it was
my grandfather who was watching over me. This apparition has been seen outside
of my room too. One day my mom was doing some gardening when she heard someone
walking up to our front porch. She looked over her shoulder and saw something
white, she thought it was my father and paid no more attention to it. She then
went to the bathroom where she discovered that my dad had been in the shower
all the time, he hadn&#8217;t been out side at all. One more thing happened about
five years ago; at that time my room was outside of the main house, in its own
separate building. Many night I would hear this strange thumping sounds. It
sounded almost like dropping a bouncing ball on the floor, the thumping sounds
came at faster and faster intervals until they eventually went away, only to
start again a couple of minutes later.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Have more paranormal encounters to tell you but I will do that some
other time<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I do not know where or to
whom I should send this story, so I'm sorry if this is at the wrong place.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">My grand-mother learned that
I was interested in the paranormal and she told me of a story that happened to
her grand-mother,so my great great grand-ma.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">My great great grand-mother
was a Native American and married a french canadian man. They moved in into a
two story house that was brand new and for a very good price. They didn't think
anything was fishy really, so they bought the house. A couple of days passed,
they moved in and nothing happened. But things started to get worse. The
cupboards doors and the drawers would open and close by themselves, the cutlery
would rattle in the drawers and they heard voices and foot steps in the house.
My great great grand-mother was not scared of spirits. Being native american
they had a strong beleif in the supernatural and spirits. One night she was in
bed with her husband and they heard foot steps coming up the stairs to their
bedroom. Great great grand-ma sat up in bed and said "We want you no harm
so leave us alone!" and the foot steps stopped for that night. One night
in autumn, great great grand-pa was sitting close to the wood stove, warming up
and smoking his pipe when he was suddenly slapped hard accross the face! He
knew it wasn't his wife because she was in the kitchen peeling potatoes. When
he showed her the hand mark, they decided they had enough.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Looking in the history of the
land it was built on, they realised that the entrepreneur was a crook! The
house had been built on an ancient graveyard that the grave markers had been taken
off. They had the house blessed and great great grand-ma ran a native american
purification ritual in the house. But I don't know if it did anything.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I remember when I was 6 or 7,
my great grand-mother's brother live in that house..and I remember that un-easy
feeling. It was like a weight on my chest and I knew that I wasn't welcomed
there At All! It was like somebody was saying " GO AWAY! THIS ISN'T YOUR
HOUSE!!". My grand-mother and my mom tried to get me to go there again but
I never wanted, crying long because I didn't like the house. When my great
grand-mother died, her brother moved out, saying he would follow her and he
died a couple of months after. I don't know what happened to the house though.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">This is the story that my
grand-ma told me, my mother was also there. It's a family story.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Chautauqua<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Miamisburg</st1:City>,<st1:State w:st="on">Ohio</st1:State></st1:place>) is a former summer getaway spot for
families from the early 1900's to sometime in the 1950's. The area was also
once inhabitied by the Maumee Indians. Whom lived along the <st1:place w:st="on">Miami
 River</st1:place>. It is also rumored to be a gambling town at one time. For
the most part it was a holy meeting place. There are many stories and legends
about Chautauqua. We had a bought a home a few years ago there along Western
St. From day one I knew the place to be haunted.(I'm a sensitive) The bad smell
at the foot of our dinning room steps was demonic in nature.After hanging a
picture of Jesus the smells stopped. There were scratching,knockings in the
walls. I was awoken around 3:15 every morning.We'd hear footstep approaching us
but none was ever there. The ghost mimicked our voices,and our pets would react
in an aggressive manner<span style="">&nbsp; </span>to certain areas
in the home .We always felt uneasy in that house! I heard many things may have
caused these hauntings,from the boy whom died while huffing gas with his
friends,someone hung themselves off of our top balcony.And the old winter
caretaker to the place still checks all the homes in the fall, as if they were
still being locked up for the winter.He had died in a fire in one of the homes
back in the 1940's.Either way were so glad to have moved from that tainted
area!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Getting my first apartment was the most
exciting thing that has ever happened to me, but things took quite a different
turn. In the summer of 2001 we moved into an upstairs apartment, my brother
lived downstairs. This house was an old house but looked up to date inside, you
can tell at one time it was a whole house. Everything went fine the first year
then wierd things started to happen. My first encounter of the supernatural was
when I heard the lights turn on after I turned it off. After that it just went
down hill. The TV would come on after we turned it off, the lights started to
flicker when we would discuss the haunting issue. I got to the point where I
was too scared to stay home alone when my husband worked nights. My younger
brother lived with us at the time and stayed in the back room one night he
heard little girls laughing and knocking at his bedroom door. He also saw a
black shadow come through the window late at night. I thought to myself if this
house was haunted, why didnt it happen at the beginning?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I also tried to research the house on
Internet, nothing came up..I asked the last tenants who lived there if they
encountered anything unusual and she experienced the same things just not as
bad as us. During the course of time we lived there we can feel that there is a
presence of a lady, two girls and an older man that comes through. We took some
pictures and captured some faces in there, I would like the pictures to get
analyzed by a professional to see if there are really ghosts captured in the
photo. Eventually I couldn't take it anymore and moved out. Apparently there
are many unfinished business that needs to be closed in that house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>In the summer os 1992 my mother, sister and
myself moved to the small town of <st1:City w:st="on">Lawton</st1:City>, <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Michigan</st1:place></st1:State>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My mothers then boyfriend, later husband [Who
died only 3 days after their wedding due to cancer] lived there as he rented a
home that his mother owned. Before my mother and her boyfriend [Doug] were
together he had spent a good 5-6 years with a woman named Sue living in the
home, my mother was good friends with both of them. One day, Doug had returned
home from work and searched for Sue with no success. The bathroom door was
locked from the inside and as he called to her there was no answer. He then
went outside and and entered the bathroom through the bathroom window and found
Sue hanging from the shower head by one of Doug's belts. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Getting back to my
experiences. I was in the house from 14 to 15 [I was kicked out and moved in
with my girlfriend] anyway, I had two different experiences that really freaked
me out. The 1st was one day I was downstairs laying on the couch zoned out
watching television. I heard someone walking down the stairs and my brain
registered it as my mother, the stairs were wood and Doug was a larger guy and
I had already adjusted to the sounds of the house. The person passed infront of
me even breaking my line of sight to the television and they passed through the
living room into the kitchen and then the bathroom. About 10 minutes or so
later my mother came downstairs and I asked her how she got back upstairs. She
said she had just gotten up to throw on some coffee now. I asked about Doug and
she said he was still upstairs sleeping. My sister had spent the weekend at a
friend of hers. The 2nd, and the most freaky, was one day I had a bunch of friends
over in the front yard. I had to take a leak so I went into the house [My
mother and Doug were gone and everyone was outside] and went into the bathroom.
I had always been nervous of the bathroom area of the house. When I would use
the restroom I would leave the door open [Even #2] and when I showered I would
constantly open the curtain to make sure noone shut the door on me. I also had
an exit ritual, the door had a lock on the outside and my thought was always
whatever might be in there, in there is where it can stay so, I always kept the
door locked from the outside. I used the toilet and I locked the door, the lock
being the pin type, pull it over into the hole and drop the latch down. As I
then proceeded toward the livingroom from behind me I heard a "click
click" and I stopped, praying what I heard wasn't what I thought it was. I
then heard a "creaking" type noise and when I turned around for a
split second I saw the door opening. I say a split second because after a
second glimpse I ran out of the house into the front yard and stood there,
frozen. My friends asked me what my problem was and as I told them they laughed
at me. My cousin Carl, the tallest of us, I had take a look through the big
picture window and I asked him if he could see through and he said yes. I asked
him if he could see the bathroom door and he said yes. When I then asked him it
the door was open or closed, he responded open.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>In 1987 [I was 9] my grandmother stayed the
night at our house before going to church the next day. She was Seventh Day
Adventist and an elementary school teacher. My sister and I loved our
grandmother and before going to church the next morning, on her way out the
door I asked her if after church she could come back and stay the night again,
her reply was "Paul, I'm never coming back". Being all of 9 years
old, I didn't know what to make of this, definately not what ultimately ended
up happening. My parents lived on 15 acres of woods, and that night she took my
grandfathers shotgun out back, put it in her mouth and pulled the trigger. For
the fact that she told me what she did, I have always held a certain level of
regret for not understanding and questioning her statement that morning.
Anyway, I'm not for certain how long after the fact, but one night, as my
sister always did when scared from watching a scary movie, bad dream etc. layed
down on the floor next to my bed and slept as she felt safer, me being her big
brother and all. I had rolled over in the night and awoke slightly and noticed
not only my sister sleeping on the floor next to my bed and someone laying next
to her running her hands through my sisters hair as they both lay facing away
from me. I watched for a moment wondering exactly what was going on and then
her hand paused in my sisters hair and she turned to face me and what I saw was
my grandmother looking at me with glowing red eyes. I then rolled over quickly,
grabbing my pillow and putting it over my head trying to go to sleep because I
figured if I was going to die then I'm going in my sleep. The next morning my
mother asked why I didn't wake her up, and considering in order to get to my
mothers' room I'd have to step over them just to get to my door...I chose the
next best thing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">2 Personal Experiences<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Hi there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I just wanted to share a personal experience
with you that I had when I was very little.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Some of this is hard to remember because I was about 3 years old at the
time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I can still describe what I saw
and remember it vividly, although some of the other details I had to get again
from my parents, who were there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">From what I remember first is
being in the car with my parents and my sister.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I always thought we were driving home, by my mom says we were going the
opposite direction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Either way, we were
about a mile from our house at the time and we lived out in the country. What I
remember next is driving down the country road and asking my mom what these
boys were doing out in the cornfield.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
mom said "what boys?"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
pointed out into the field and said something like "right there, why are
they crying?"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She told me again
that she didn't see anyone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I told her
that I saw two boys out in the cornfield sitting on this big log and their
shirts were covered in blood and they were crying and looking at each other
like "what just happened".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
clearly remember that they were both wearing white t-shirts and blue jeans and
and having blood all over them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
memory has faded very very little since then.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thats all I can really remember from that day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was around my early teens when my mom told
me another part of the story I had never heard before.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We must of been talking about that experience
or something because she told me what happened there in that exact spot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She said that two kids in their teens were
murdered there in that spot about 3 years before I was born.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I guess the story was that two men had been
driving behind them down this road and managed to get them to pull over.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For whatever reason the two men killed both
the kids with a shotgun and left them in the ditch right there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was freaky enough to hear at the time,
but what really got me was a surprise in the newspaper about 6 or 7 years
ago.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I don't really read the paper that
much, but I picked it up one day and saw an article on a man who had been
convicted of murder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As I was reading I
realized it was the same man who pulled the trigger on those kids.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The article describes the boys and the road
it happened on and the year it happened and how it happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was a true story!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I couldn't believe it, I felt so weird that
day...all day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To finally have my
experience confirmed that what happened there was really true, it blew my
mind!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I still have that page from the
paper saved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I wish I could tell you
more but that is all I can remember about it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I just remembered another
experience I can share with you if interested.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">This one happened to me and
one of my friends at the grocery store we worked in at the time in my hometown
(<st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Mahomet</st1:City>, <st1:State w:st="on">IL</st1:State></st1:place>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was around 10 years ago.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There had always been stories about that
store being haunted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, naturally, I
wanted to get a job there!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My buddy
worked in the deli and he managed to get me hired on there as well.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I remember we were closing the deli down for
the night and he was leaning over the sink washing some dishes and I was
standing there talking to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was at
the side of the sink and I looked over to my left and he turned around at the
exact same time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There are two support
posts on the other side of the deli.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
saw this shadow in the shape of a man and it was solid black walk into the deli
and go behind the first support post and then it disappeared.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It then reappeared on the other side of the
second post (about 10 feet away) and went to the back of the deli into the dead
end hall where the walk-in cooler and walk-in freezer are.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were both were a little freaked out by
what we just saw but my curiousity overrid my fear and I went back to look in
the cooler and the freezer and it was gone, there was nothing there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was a manager there that had commited
suicide a few years or so before this happened.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>His wife was ironicly my school bus driver years bofore.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no way for me to tell if it was him
or not, it could of been.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was the
last time I ever saw an apparition of something or someone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I've had other little things happen here and
there but nothing like those two times.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I would love to see something again now at my present age of 28 as I'm a
bit older and would probably take it a little different or have a better
understanding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anyway, I just wanted to
share those two personal experiences with you and I hope you found them
interesting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thanks.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
