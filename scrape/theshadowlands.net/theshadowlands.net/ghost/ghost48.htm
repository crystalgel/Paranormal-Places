<P>
<P><B>I recently read a story where a woman said she noticed most of the
</B>
<P><B>     occurences happened when the person was in bed..well Mrs., here's
a </B>
<P><B>     true bedtime story for you... </B>
<P><B>     </B>
<P><B>     My father was in the army and this particular time we had just
moved </B>
<P><B>     to Ft. Polk, Louisiana. Being that we recently got there we didn't
</B>
<P><B>     have a house so we had to stay in the guest house, well all five
of us </B>
<P><B>     had to sleep in the same room so you know it wasn't very big.
The </B>
<P><B>     basic layout went like this: It was a single room and when you
stood </B>
<P><B>     at the door there was a couch which unfolded into a sofa bed (I
slept </B>
<P><B>     here), in front of it is where the t.v. was. Next to it was a
queen </B>
<P><B>     size bed (my two sisters slept here) and next to it was another
queen </B>
<P><B>     size (my parents slept here), in front of my sisters bed was the
</B>
<P><B>     entrance to the bathroom which, as you guessed, wasn't very big.
</B>
<P><B>     </B>
<P><B>     Well one day everyone had gone to sleep already and I was laying
in </B>
<P><B>     bed watching t.v. when out of the corner of my eye I saw a figure
</B>
<P><B>     appear from the bathroom from a little above the waist down. It
had a </B>
<P><B>     yellow shirt tucked in to a pair of faded blue jeans and all I
could </B>
<P><B>     see of the arms was from the middle of the forearms down to the
hands. </B>
<P><B>     Well it walked out of the bathroom and walked to the right hand
corner </B>
<P><B>     of my bed and stood there like it was staring at me and it stood
there </B>
<P><B>     for a few seconds and then moved toward my sisters bed. The whole
time </B>
<P><B>     I was laying there whispering four letter profanities to myself,
then </B>
<P><B>     I got a hold of myself and said that I have to look but I foiund
</B>
<P><B>     myself unable to move, frozen, and unable to speak. Still watching
it </B>
<P><B>     out of the corner of my eyes it stopped at the foot of my two
lilttle </B>
<P><B>     sisters' bed and stood there as if it was staring at them, watching
</B>
<P><B>     them in their sleep. Then as before it turned and went towards
my </B>
<P><B>     parents bed and repeated the routine, this time it stayed just
a bit </B>
<P><B>     longer and when it was done it turned ninety degrees to face me
and </B>
<P><B>     raised a hand as if it were saying goodbye. It began to walk towards
</B>
<P><B>     the bathroom which wasn't more than a few feet away and still
frozen I </B>
<P><B>     still couldn't turn to look. Just as it was beginning to turn
into the </B>
<P><B>     bathroom I unfroze and got a good glimpse of it's back just as
it was </B>
<P><B>     beginning to disappear in the soft glow of some type of light
that </B>
<P><B>     seemed more implied than it was actully there. I never felt fear,
more </B>
<P><B>     like a worried sense that I would not get to really look at it.
Now </B>
<P><B>     some may attribute this to being sleepy but I'll tell you skeptics
</B>
<P><B>     this, the whole time I know I was wide awake because the t.v.
was </B>
<P><B>     showing "The Jackie Robinson Story" and I could notice the program
</B>
<P><B>     progressing, also the fact remains that after this everyone woke
up at </B>
<P><B>     the same time I unfroze complaining of a mild headache. My family
has </B>
<P><B>     been known to associate with the paranormal one way or another
</B>
<P><B>     throughout it's history per accounts told to me by my grandmother,
My </B>
<P><B>     grand father was a medium of sorts, so I've been told, you see
I never </B>
<P><B>     knew him or even met him, but one day when I was twelve years
old I </B>
<P><B>     had a sort of dream-vision of a older man who came to talk to
me. He </B>
<P><B>     reassured me everything would be allright (I had serious family
</B>
<P><B>     problems) and we sat and talked. I didn't want to leave but he
made </B>
<P><B>     me, so when I awoke I told my mother who then showed me a picture
and </B>
<P><B>     it was the same man!</B>
<P><B>     My grandfather told it would be allright and it has been for the
past </B>
<P><B>     at least ten years.</B>
<P><B>     </B>
<P><B>     Skeptics beware!!, the proof is in the pudding..all these people
can't </B>
<P><B>     be making this up. If you have any questions or comments let me
know </B>
<P><B>     because it would really be appreciated.</B>

<H3><A NAME=true>ATrue Haunted House</A>
</H3><P><B>by jwc55@concentric.net </B>
<P>
<P><B>When I was about ten or eleven years old a lived in a small neighborhood
</B>
<P><B>in Illinois. All of the kids would hang out together during the day.
My </B>
<P><B>friend Matt lived next door to the house where is Grandpa and aunt
lived </B>
<P><B>when they were alive. His grandma couldn't stand to have it tore down
</B>
<P><B>right away, so they left it up for a long while. It eventually got
so </B>
<P><B>bad that you couldn't go into it for safety reasons. We would always
</B>
<P><B>tell each other that we saw ghosts in the windows, even if we didn't,
</B>
<P><B>because we liked scaring each other. I decided I was going to scare
Matt </B>
<P><B>and my sister. I looked in the window, but to my surprise I was scared.
</B>
<P><B>You see Matt's aunt had died in that house, so we told each other we
saw </B>
<P><B>ghosts, so that was what I was going to do. When I looked in the window,
</B>
<P><B>though, I saw Matt's dead aunt rocking in a rocking chair. She was
</B>
<P><B>knitting something, while sitting in front of the fire. I yelled for
</B>
<P><B>Matt and Amber to come look. While we all three were standing there,
the </B>
<P><B>figure suddenly turned and looked at us. We ran like there was no </B>
<P><B>tomorrow. </B>
<P><B>	About three weeks later my cousin Jenny and I were walking in </B>
<P><B>front of the house. There was a window that had fell towards the road
a </B>
<P><B>while back, but was still laying on the sidewalk. We were about fifty
</B>
<P><B>feet away from this wondow, when we heard weird noises. We looked </B>
<P><B>towards the house and a small piece of glass flew close to the ground
</B>
<P><B>and cut Jenny's ankle. It wasn't a bad cut, but a cut all the same.
It </B>
<P><B>didn't hurt either one of us, but we were sure scared. </B>
<P><B>	Ever since those two things happened I have been followed by </B>
<P><B>ghosts, even after I moved. I see figures and hear noises that frighten
</B>
<P><B>me. It's been at least five years since these two things happened to
me, </B>
<P><B>but from time to time I can still feel someone looking over my shoulder
</B>
<P><B>or watching me lie in bed. I know I'm not crazy, but I am being stalked
</B>
<P><B>by ghosts. The house got torn down about three or four years ago, but
</B>
<P><B>all it did was make me feel like there is someone around more often.
</B>
<P><B>	If you have any helpful hints, let me know. I could sure use the </B>
<P><B>extra sleep at night...</B>

<H3><A NAME=my>My Haunted House</A>
</H3><P><B>by funyet@home.com </B>
<P>
<P><B>I don't think my experiances are nearly as scary as yours but here
it</B>
<P><B>goes. Before i get started, I have to tell you that my house was
built</B>
<P><B>in 1876.  When I was a boy, about 6 or seven, I went up it to the
attic</B>
<P><B>at  7:00 at night, it was winter time so it was very dark at that
time</B>
<P><B>at night. Well anyway, i went up there to look for something and I
tried</B>
<P><B>to turn on the light but it didn't turn on, so I proceeded up the
stairs</B>
<P><B>to try to turn on the other light.  I go got up to the top when i saw</B>
<P><B>many humans, walking around, they were life-like but you couldn't see</B>
<P><B>them from a distance, only when you got up close.  It was like some
sort</B>
<P><B>of party, they were drinking and having a good time, they didn't
notice</B>
<P><B>me. I didn't seem feel that they were bad or good they were just there.
</B>
<P><B>They didn't bother me so I continued to look for what i was looking</B>
<P><B>for.  They were dressed in clothes from that time.  I stayed to watch</B>
<P><B>until they end.  Two of the drunken men got into at fight.  One of
the</B>
<P><B>men died at the end. I left because i was thinking that maybe they
did</B>
<P><B>see me, so I left afraid that they would hurt me.  I have many other</B>
<P><B>ghost stories but i'll save them for another day.  And whenever i go</B>
<P><B>into the bathroom, i usually don't lock the door but when i try to
get</B>
<P><B>out the door is locked.  Other times when i am home by myself, i her</B>
<P><B>people walking though they hallways of my house, up and down the
stairs</B>
<P><B>and all through the house, thinking maybe someone just came home i
call</B>
<P><B>to them and no one answers. Another time, my family had just gotten
a</B>
<P><B>new thermostat so we were learning how to use it.  It was the winter</B>
<P><B>time and the day after, it was freezing in the house. Apparently
there</B>
<P><B>was a extra thing so that you could turn off the heat completely, no
one</B>
<P><B>new where it was so it couldn't have been anyone of us.  Near
Christmas</B>
<P><B>time, I slept downstairs near the christmas tree.  It was around 4
A.M.</B>
<P><B>and i woke up i saw someone stand in fromt of the tree and watching
me. </B>
<P><B>It was a man.  I thought maybe it was just my dad and i went back to</B>
<P><B>sleep. But that evening i asked my dad if it was him and he said no
it</B>
<P><B>wasn't.  If anyone has any reasoning as to why this happened please</B>
<P><B>e-mail me.</B>

<H3><A NAME=apartment>California Apartment</A>
</H3><P><B>by JColli8127@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>This is one of the most terrifying experiences that I have ever had!
I was living in an apartment in Southern California for only a short time,
it was five in the morning and my husband had just left for work. No sooner
did he go out the door when I heard the door open and 'walking' through the
living room to my bedroom. Then my bed sank and I just thought it was my
husband that he decided not to go to work. I turned around with a smile and
almost passed out! There was a huge fat man laying on his back and with his
head turned to me just giving me a big open mouth smile, revealing his rotten
teeth. His face was very pocked with red deep holes. He resembled my ex-husband,
with his Indian Chicasaw face, black hair and the heavy build, the man I
was married to at this time. I knew he wasn't human like us, but he was fully
manifested. I have seen ghost many times in my life and I always know they
are ghost, but I don't know how.&lt;BR&gt;</B>
<P>
<P><B>I didn't know what to do because he didn't show any signs of leaving,
so I decided to say the Lord's prayer, and with that he disappeared. But
only within a few seconds there was another ghost at the left hand foot of
the bed. He was a little wrinkle old man that was dressed in pirate apparel.
He too had rotten teeth that was revealed with him smiling as he walked slowly
toward me. He had a dirty white rag which he held out and was waving it at
me. I could smell the stench of death. It being a dry dusty and dirty odor.
Again I prayed the Lord's prayer and he too disappeared. I got up because
I was too fighten to stay in bed.&lt;BR&gt;</B>
<P>
<P><B>Several days later after my husband left for work at five, again I
was woken up by a young blond hair fellow. He actually had my right arm twisted
behind my back and had me in a sitting position, then said in an audible
voice, "I'll teach you!" Again I repeated the Lord's prayer and he too instantly
disappeared.</B>
<P>
<P><B>There are other things that both my husband and I witnessed while living
there, but not as frightening. We finally found out that the two families
that previously lived there almost had terrible tragedies. The first family
a child almost drowned in the swimming pool, and the last family the man
was almost killed in a car accident.</B>
<P>
<P><B>We heard voices, had a long experience with a cat coming to our door.
 The manager accused me of feeding it.The water would turn on and I would
have to turn it off.   Music play when we would go to bed and I would have
to turn off the stereo system. One morning I found all the stubs torn off
of twelve hundred dollars worth of travelers checks, and they were thrown
into the powder room wash bowl with water ran on them. Also orange balls
of light floated around in the living room at night. One night a couple in
the upstairs apartment were having sex and were using very graphic language.
We complained to the manager and she got upset with us because no one lived
in that particular apartment for two months.</B>
<P><B>We left when we found that the manager was involved in witchcraft.</B>
<P><B>I've had many experiences, but not quite so terrifying as in this one
dwelling. However I have had more than my share for one life time of the
paranormal, but one does become almost immune to feelings of fear. Ghost
are all around us, and those that can't see them and aren't aware of them
are fortunate.  However we all must remember that there are good and bad
entities and we must try to be careful which ones we allow into our lives.
 After all they use to be people like us in bodies of flesh and there are
many people I won't allow into my life, so why should I with the spirit world.
 Sometimes spirits will attach themselves to one and they are extremely hard
to get rid of.  I most certainly understand that.</B>
<P><B>I've been having a problem with certain spirits coming into me through
the night and talking.  I record them on a voice activator, both in me and
just being in the bedroom.  I was losing a lot of sleep so I bought a cross
and wore it during the day and put it under my pillow at night, but that
was like buying a piece of candy, it just didn't work.  I read an article
on the web that suggested to keep a camera by one's bed and snap pictures
if you suspect there is an entity there.  It has been going on two weeks
now and the first night one tried to come in me, by rocking my body back
and forth, it seems this is the proceedure for them to get in.  Then they
start talking.  I quickly grabbed my camera and snapped a picture with that
I was able to sleep the entire night without being disturbed.   Finally last
night one of the ghosts tried again to come into me and again I grabbed the
camera and snapped a picture and the entity stopped.  Can't say it left because
I don't know that.  For some reason they just don't like having their picture
taken, so the camera can be a fabulous weapon.  Can't use a gun, but sure
can use a camera!</B>
<P><B>Hope you enjoyed just one of many encounters I have had in my life
time and still am experiencing their antics, but am mellowed out and not
scared as when I was younger. </B>
<P><B>If anyone e-mails me please use the word "Ghosts" or I will delete
it for junk mail.  </B>

<H3><B><A NAME=road>Woman in the Road</A></B>
</H3><P><B>by name withheld by request</B>
<P>
<P><B>This is just a little story I have, that really happened to me not
to</B>
<P><B>long ago.  I was getting a ride home from work, and I work the late</B>
<P><B>shift, so it was about 3 in the morning.  When this happened, I
thought</B>
<P><B>it was just my eyes playing tricks on me, but I swear I saw a woman</B>
<P><B>walking down the middle of the road.  She was tall with curly dark
hair,</B>
<P><B>and she was wearing a white shirt and what looked like denim shorts.
 I</B>
<P><B>was afriad that my friend would hit her, so I screamed and he swerved</B>
<P><B>off the road onto the shoulder.  When I told him what I saw, he
looked</B>
<P><B>at me like I was crazy and finished driving me home.  The next day,
I</B>
<P><B>told another friend about my sighting and she told me that supposedly</B>
<P><B>back in the 70's a woman fitting that description was walking along
that</B>
<P><B>same stretch of road when she was struck and killed in a hit and run.
 I</B>
<P><B>looked into some old newspapers from that time, but found nothing,
so I</B>
<P><B>really don't know if it was my eyes playing tricks on me and my
friend</B>
<P><B>making a joke or if it was all true, but that is what I saw.</B>

<H3><A NAME=utah>Haunted Utah House</A>
</H3><P><B>by RPikula@brobeck.com </B>
<P>
<P><B>This is the second submission I've made to your web page. This story</B>
<P><B>happened to me when I lived in a small town in northern Utah. I moved</B>
<P><B>into a brand new house in a small town in northern Utah with two</B>
<P><B>roommates, one of whom was an old friend named Pat, the other was
Pat's</B>
<P><B>cousin named Justin. The house was newly built and very large and was</B>
<P><B>surrounded by fields and pastureland. From day one I felt an uneasy</B>
<P><B>feeling in the house and in my room. There was a constant feeling of</B>
<P><B>being watched, and it was always cold no matter how high you cranked
the</B>
<P><B>thermostat. I attended college in a nearby town and wasn't working
and</B>
<P><B>so I would leave early in the morning before Pat or Justin were up
and</B>
<P><B>got home in the afternoon before Pat or Justin got home from work.
Every</B>
<P><B>morning when I would get up to take my shower I had an incredible</B>
<P><B>feeling of fear and of being watched. I couldn't wait to leave for</B>
<P><B>school just to be out of that house. In the afternoon I would be home</B>
<P><B>alone and would hear faint voices carrying on a conversation but I
could</B>
<P><B>never pinpoint where the voices came from. It wasn't the stereo,
t.v.,</B>
<P><B>or anything else I could find. If I was upstairs I could hear the
voices</B>
<P><B>and doors opening and closing downstairs, if I was downstairs I could</B>
<P><B>hear it upstairs. I never asked Pat or Justin if they noticed these</B>
<P><B>things also because I thought there had to be some logical
explanation,</B>
<P><B>until one night for some reason I awoke in the early morning around,</B>
<P><B>3a.m., and felt myself completely wide awake. I felt like something
was</B>
<P><B>wrong and because I felt uncomfortable in the house anyway I always</B>
<P><B>locked myself in my bedroom for my own security. All of a sudden I
heard</B>
<P><B>a voice say my name. I couldn't believe if I heard it audibly or if
it</B>
<P><B>was just my own mind playing tricks on me so I said "what?" and then
I</B>
<P><B>heard the voice say my name again. I got up and turned on the lights
and</B>
<P><B>there was nothing. I opened my door and looked in the hall and
nothing.</B>
<P><B>The next morning I asked Pat if he had played a trick on me and he</B>
<P><B>didn't know what I was talking about. He then asked me, rather</B>
<P><B>sheepishly if I had heard or experienced any other weird things in
the</B>
<P><B>house and then he proceeded to tell me how he always hears far off</B>
<P><B>voices and doors opening and closing when he is home by himself. So
I</B>
<P><B>knew then I wasn't going crazy but still we were both bothered by the</B>
<P><B>goings on. A few nights later Pat awoke in the middle of the night,
his</B>
<P><B>bedroom was in the basement of the house, and he had a really bad</B>
<P><B>feeling, he suddenly saw a black outline of a figure run across the
room</B>
<P><B>toward him and duck at the foot of his bed. He sat up and looked down</B>
<P><B>and could see a figure hunched down looking as if it was about to</B>
<P><B>pounce. He turned to switch a light on near his bed and when he
looked</B>
<P><B>back there was nothing there. Needless to say that when he told me
about</B>
<P><B>it we both wanted to move. We found out later that our other roommate</B>
<P><B>Justin was, unknown to us, heavily into drugs, pornography, and we
think</B>
<P><B>the occult too. We did move and nothing of this sort has happened to
us</B>
<P><B>since.</B>

</H3><P><B>by 	RPikula@brobeck.com </B>
<P>
<P><B>This is a true story that happened to a friend of mine. It is very</B>
<P><B>similar to the story submitted as "Attacked", 8/1/98. My friend and
his</B>
<P><B>roommate shared an apartment and one night, (I'll call him Bill) Bill</B>
<P><B>came home late and went straight to bed. He was lying in bed but felt</B>
<P><B>very uneasy and he could hear a hollow tapping sound. He started to
look</B>
<P><B>around the room in the dark to see if he could discover what could
be</B>
<P><B>making the sound. He noticed that one corner of the room was much
darker</B>
<P><B>than the other corners and thought it odd. He started to focus his</B>
<P><B>attention on the darkness and while doing so the darkness started to</B>
<P><B>grow larger and larger and spread throughout the room. He then
noticed</B>
<P><B>that he could see a human figure. He described the figure as a male</B>
<P><B>figure and felt very intrigued as to what he was seeing. The figure
then</B>
<P><B>started taking on more details and he could make out that the figure
was</B>
<P><B>wearing black loose pants, had no shirt on, and was barefoot also.
The</B>
<P><B>figure looked very thin and malnourished and had very long black
unkempt</B>
<P><B>hair. The figure was holding a machete which he was tapping on the</B>
<P><B>hardwood floor of the apartment. Bill couldn't believe what he was</B>
<P><B>seeing and shut his eyes to make sure he wasn't just imagining and
when</B>
<P><B>he opened them back up a second later the figure was inches in front
of</B>
<P><B>his face. All Bill could do was say a prayer to God in his mind and</B>
<P><B>instantly the figure was gone. My friend Bill swears this really</B>
<P><B>happened and I believe him because he is not the type to make this
type</B>
<P><B>of thing up. I find it interesting that there are similarities
between</B>
<P><B>this story and others on your web page. I never really believed in</B>
<P><B>ghosts but I do believe in God and because I of that I do believe
that</B>
<P><B>there are evil opposing forces. </B>

<H3><A NAME=old>The Old Victorian House</A> 
</H3><P><B>by cat@frontiernet.net </B>
<P>
<P><B>The 'instances' began to occur soon after my parents, myself and four</B>
<P><B>brothers moved into an old Victorian House in a small town in Iowa.
 The</B>
<P><B>house was rather dilapidated, long since shed its former glory with
its</B>
<P><B>peeling paint.  But it suited my parents' pockets and with such a
large</B>
<P><B>family the four bedrooms had great appeal.  All too soon we learned
if we</B>
<P><B>wanted to live in the house with some semblance of peace we had best</B>
<P><B>delegate what we call the 'back bedroom' in that you had to pass
through</B>
<P><B>another bedroom to get to it, to an unseen inhabitant that stocked
the</B>
<P><B>night in agitated frustration if you dare to venture into her room.
</B>
<P>
<P><B>When we first moved in, the back bedroom, unlike the rest of the
house</B>
<P><B>retained a vintage of it past.  Filled with treasures that would fancy
any</B>
<P><B>child's delight.  A beautiful bedroom set, complete with vanity and
an</B>
<P><B>ornate wardrobe closet, filled with clothes and finery that would
suggest</B>
<P><B>that a 'lady' had once occupied the room. We kids, loved to play in
that</B>
<P><B>room well my parents undertook the job of renovating the house. </B>
<P>
<P><B>The first instances that denoted a unseen presence in the house was
an odd</B>
<P><B>patterned sound heard late in the night. Sort of a
shuffle-shuffle-knock</B>
<P><B>across the creaking wood floors upstairs.  This was always followed
by our</B>
<P><B>dog's sudden agitation.  Laying at the foot of the stairs, he'd twitch
his</B>
<P><B>ears, then bare his teeth and begin to growl as if he saw someone
standing</B>
<P><B>at the top of the stairs.  An investigation would reveal no one was
there. </B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>As the weeks progressed, other things began to occur. Little nuances
that</B>
<P><B>more often than not pointed the finger at the five child occupants.
 Lights</B>
<P><B>left on.  The water in the kitchen sink would be found running full
blast</B>
<P><B>in the morning and on occasion the front door would be found standing
wide</B>
<P><B>open when my father distinctly recalled locking the door before he
retired.</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>The shuffling sound became more pronounced, occurring nightly.   My
parents</B>
<P><B>bedroom, located on the first floor, would often awaken to the noise,</B>
<P><B>thinking they had arrant children up and about, my father would stomp
up</B>
<P><B>the stairs prepared to seek justice only to find all five of them
tucked</B>
<P><B>away.  Fast asleep. </B>
<P>
<P><B>My father, still convinced it was a child at play, decided to stay
up late</B>
<P><B>one night in hopes of surprising the culprit or culprits.  I can not
credit</B>
<P><B>this part of the story, beyond the fact that my father was of a very</B>
<P><B>serious nature, from the old school that ruled the child with a rod.
 </B>
<P>
<P><B>At the first sound of the shuffle, my father moved quietly up the
stairs,</B>
<P><B>in hopes of catching the culprit by surprise.  As it turns out he was
the</B>
<P><B>one who was surprised.  For all his children were still fast asleep.
But</B>
<P><B>something.  Someone was awake.  The details he described later,
denoting</B>
<P><B>that they had set his hairs standing on end was that the door to the
back</B>
<P><B>bedroom, yet occupied and still filled with the previous owners effects,
</B>
<P><B>lay open.  Sitting at the top of the stairs, my father peered into
the</B>
<P><B>front bedroom where three of his child lay fast asleep, transfixed
as he</B>
<P><B>watched the dresser drawers slid open, only to be shoved shut, then
the</B>
<P><B>mattress springs of the old metal bed shook, as if unseen fingers
thought</B>
<P><B>to wake the children.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>My parents, seeking the why or what of it began to dig into it the
history</B>
<P><B>of the house.  They knew that there had been only one owner. A women
who</B>
<P><B>had lived well into her eighties.  What they didn't know was that she
had</B>
<P><B>died in the house, fell down the stairs and broke her neck.  The back</B>
<P><B>bedroom, had been her bedroom.  The furnishings and personal effects
hers</B>
<P><B>as well.  And even more disturbing, was the fact that she had in the
last</B>
<P><B>few years of her life become a recluse and a shut in and as such
always</B>
<P><B>wore slippers upon her feet and walked with the assistance of a cane.
 Thus</B>
<P><B>explained the mystery of the odd patterned shuffle-shuffle knock across
the</B>
<P><B>creaking floor.     </B>
<P>
<P><B>The first thing that my father did was to lock the back bedroom.  In</B>
<P><B>essence, sealing it off.  An unavowed promise to leave her 'stuff'
and</B>
<P><B>domain alone in the hopes that she would offers us the same courtesy.
 In</B>
<P><B>the following six years that we lived in the house, she was rarely</B>
<P><B>meddlesome or agitated, though her presence was still noted on occasion
by</B>
<P><B>the shuffle-shuffle-knock across the creaking floor. She did have her
days</B>
<P><B>thought.  A few instances I clearly recall was an occasion in the dead
of</B>
<P><B>winter that my parent awoke to the cold in the middle of the night
only to</B>
<P><B>find that once again the front door had been left ajar and in the wake
of a</B>
<P><B>snow storm, three inches of snow cover the entire dining room.  We'd
would</B>
<P><B>awaken to find the Christmas tree light blaring into the otherwise</B>
<P><B>blackness of the  living room when my parents clearly recalled
unplugging</B>
<P><B>them.  And on occasion, we'd still find the water facet in the
kitchen</B>
<P><B>running full blast.  On these rare occasions, it is interesting to
note</B>
<P><B>that the back bedroom door, her bedroom door, would always be found
unlock</B>
<P><B>and ajar.</B>

<H3><A NAME=light>The Ghost Light of Summerville</A>
</H3><P><B>by kaysalu@hotmail.com </B>
<P>
<P><B>This story is a lot like The light of St. Louis story I was reading
</B>
<P><B>earlier, but this is how it goes.</B>
<P>
<P><B>My friends Brenda and Sylvia and I were out driving around after a
night </B>
<P><B>of shopping down in Charleston SC.  We live in a small town called
</B>
<P><B>Summerville about 30 minutes away from Charleston, and we had a few
</B>
<P><B>hours to kill, so we decided to drive down a road called Light Row
that </B>
<P><B>a friend of mine told me about.  He told me that the road was once
a </B>
<P><B>strip of railroad, and that a girl walking home from a friends house
</B>
<P><B>late at night when she was beaten, raped and then tied to the tracks
to </B>
<P><B>be killed by the train.  Not long after that incident, the tracks were
</B>
<P><B>covered with dirt and the railroad shut down.  Well anyways, Brenda,
</B>
<P><B>Sylvia and I decided to check it out.  We turned onto the road and
</B>
<P><B>noticed immediately that it was pitch dark, even though the road itself
</B>
<P><B>was inside the town.  We also noticed that the road was very bumpy,
just </B>
<P><B>like driving down railroad tracks.  Sylvia and I have always had a
sort </B>
<P><B>of sixth sense, and whenever something "paranormal" happens or has
</B>
<P><B>happened the hair on our arms and necks stand on end and we get </B>
<P><B>uncontrollable shivers.  Well, we both started shivering at the same
</B>
<P><B>time when we noticed what seemed to be the image of a girl walking
away </B>
<P><B>from us.  We drove faster to catch up with it and when we were about
100 </B>
<P><B>feet away from it disappeared, and a bright light shone on our faces,
so </B>
<P><B>close that it lit up the entire interior of the car.  The light was
</B>
<P><B>coming closer, and even though the windows were closed and the radio
was </B>
<P><B>on, we could here a train whistle, very loudly, as though it was right
</B>
<P><B>next to us.  The really freaky part of that is that there is no train
</B>
<P><B>tracks near that area.  Brenda, who was driving, freaked out and started
</B>
<P><B>to back the car up real fast and the faster we backed up the faster
this </B>
<P><B>light came at us.  It caught up with us, actually went through the
car </B>
<P><B>with one last whistle blast that left my ears ringing for days and
</B>
<P><B>disappeared.  Right after that, Sylvia and I stopped shivering and
our </B>
<P><B>hair fell back in place.  I was a scary incident.  Not violent scary
</B>
<P><B>mind you, but frightening nonetheless.  Either way, Brenda never went
</B>
<P><B>back, and though Sylvia and I have returned a few times -we have never
</B>
<P><B>had the same experience- we still always can hear the whistle cutting
</B>
<P><B>through the night air.</B>

<H3><B><A NAME=places>Haunted Places</A></B>
</H3><P><B>by gloomie@hotmail.com </B>
<P>
<P><B>   I got two stories for you.  When I lived in Chicago, IL, I was </B>
<P><B>going to a school called Jose De Diego Community Academy(near Clemente
</B>
<P><B>High School).  This school is said to be haunted.  Many years ago,
it </B>
<P><B>was known as Tuley High School.  One day the south wing of the  school
</B>
<P><B>caught on fire, and it is said that one or two(I don't remember) </B>
<P><B>janitor(s) never made it out.  Also that the ghosts haunt the basement
</B>
<P><B>floor of the school where footsteps and sometimes moans can be heard
</B>
<P><B>especially when hardly anyone is around like early morning or </B>
<P><B>afterschool.  A time when almost everyone has gone home and the janitors
</B>
<P><B>are cleaning up.  My brother had once told us that he and his friends
</B>
<P><B>would play basketball in the gym afterschool because one of the </B>
<P><B>(living)janitors would let them in.  One particular day the janitor
had </B>
<P><B>told them about the ghost and that they could talk to him.  He told
the </B>
<P><B>ghost to switch the lights on and off twice for yes once for no.  So
</B>
<P><B>they would ask questions and the ghost would answer at least until
they </B>
<P><B>asked it one question.  Are you a good or a bad ghost?  The ghost never
</B>
<P><B>answered.  Friecked out my brother and his friends left in a hurry.
 Who </B>
<P><B>knows if the janitor had someone flick the lights, but my brother was
</B>
<P><B>almost sure nobody was around the light switches.  One thing is for
sure </B>
<P><B>people do believe that the school is haunted.</B>
<P>
<P><B>     My second story deals with my aunt's house in Houston, Tx.  I've
</B>
<P><B>been told that her house was built on a family cemetery which lies
under </B>
<P><B>her bedroom.  At first they were classicly haunted, but after a while
</B>
<P><B>the ghosts left the family alone.  Now the only ones that are haunted
</B>
<P><B>are those who've never lived their and only come to visit.  My brother
</B>
<P><B>the same as above went to visit for the summer.  One morning he was
</B>
<P><B>their alone because everybody was at work.  He would hear a chopping
</B>
<P><B>noise coming from the kitchen as if someone was cutting vegetables,
so </B>
<P><B>he went to see if who was home. He went inside the kitchen and found
</B>
<P><B>that the noise had stopped and that the many birds that my aunts keep
</B>
<P><B>were deathly quiet.  They seemed as if too scared to sing their favorite
</B>
<P><B>songs.  Eventually he heard actual moanings.  He ran out of the house
</B>
<P><B>and sat on the porch, and it seemed as if the ghost followed him because
</B>
<P><B>now their was a pencil rolling and dropping sound coming from thier
van.  </B>
<P><B>I remember this well because he had called us at home telling us about
</B>
<P><B>how frightened he was.  I have heard the shower running when the the
</B>
<P><B>shower off and had been off for hours.  My cousin Maria has heard a
</B>
<P><B>sound of a nail tapping on the bathroom mirror when the only person
near </B>
<P><B>it was her.  It's so spooky that we take turns sitting in the bathroom
</B>
<P><B>while the other takes a bath.  One of my other aunts could have sworn
</B>
<P><B>thet they had saw someone (one of our other family members sitting
in </B>
<P><B>the living room at 2:00 in the morning when they never anywhere near
the </B>
<P><B>house.  One of my other cousins had the same kind of experience as
my </B>
<P><B>brother except one of my that lived there was home with her.  She heard
</B>
<P><B>chopping and washing noises and saw that the birds were quiet.  Also,
</B>
<P><B>she'd leave the TV off in the living room and when she would come back
</B>
<P><B>it would be turned off.  She would ask our cousin if she turned it
on </B>
<P><B>and she would say no.  I like visiting my family, but I am weary of
</B>
<P><B>their house.  The weirdest part of all is that the least or never </B>
<P><B>haunted part of the house is my aunt and uncle's bedroom where the
</B>
<P><B>cemetery is supposed to be. SPOOKY!</B>

<H3><A NAME=family>My Family's Experiences</A>
</H3><P><B>by carol.y@snet.net </B>
<P>
<P><B>When I was about 6 years old, my family and I moved into a house that</B>
<P><B>was approximately 200 years old.  The house had been many things in
the</B>
<P><B>past; including a candy shop, hair salon, post office, and living</B>
<P><B>quarters.  The area of the house that was the post office we rented</B>
<P><B>out.  I have only one experience which I remember, but my mother has</B>
<P><B>told me many things that went on there.  I remember the staircase of
our</B>
<P><B>house which had two landings-one near the top and another two steps
from</B>
<P><B>the bottom.  Hitting the second step from the first landing I would</B>
<P><B>sometimes smell fresh, rich milk chocolate, but taking a step forward
or</B>
<P><B>backwards, the smell would dissapear. This happended to my entire</B>
<P><B>family, but my father smelt lavendar perfume.</B>
<P><B>Once, when my little sister had just been born, my mother was lying
in</B>
<P><B>bed with the baby in the cradle beside her.  The baby started to cry
and</B>
<P><B>because my mother was so tired she ignored the baby thinking that my</B>
<P><B>father would care to her.  Sure enough the baby stopped crying and
my</B>
<P><B>mother saw a man rocking the cradle.  My mother went back to sleep,
but</B>
<P><B>within minutes the baby started crying again.  At this point my
father</B>
<P><B>entered the room.  Mom was up at this point, but she asked him if he</B>
<P><B>hadn't just been in there rocking the baby.  He replied that he
hadn't.</B>
<P><B>My mother and father were hosting a dinner party with their two
friends</B>
<P><B>Chuck and Marty.  The living room, where they all were, is connected</B>
<P><B>tothe kitchen by a small window, but also through the dining room
which</B>
<P><B>leads to the kitchen.  Marty was helping my mother by bringing some</B>
<P><B>dishes into the kitchen and as she walked out of the living room she
saw</B>
<P><B>an old man sitting in the overstuffed chair in the dining room.  She</B>
<P><B>walked into the kitchen very pale and when my mother asked what was</B>
<P><B>wrong she described the man in perfect detail.  He was not in the
chair</B>
<P><B>when my mother went to check.</B>
<P><B>For some reason my mother had to find her birth certificate and after</B>
<P><B>seaching the house and asking us if we knew where it was repeatedly
she</B>
<P><B>gave up.  Asking our ghostly friends to help her find it.  A few days</B>
<P><B>went by with no sign of the missing document.  Then my mother went
into</B>
<P><B>the living room and on the very corner of the wooden console was the</B>
<P><B>birht certificate she had been searching for.</B>
<P><B>Now this is one that happened to me.  I was asleep and for some reason
I</B>
<P><B>woke up to see, what I thought was, my 4 year old sister standing in
my</B>
<P><B>room. I told her to return to her own room, located adjecent to mine,</B>
<P><B>because if mom found her in mine she would get in trouble.  The girl</B>
<P><B>walked through the wall into my sister's room.</B>
<P><B>These are a few of the longer tales.  There are many other minor
ones:</B>
<P><B>seeing the top of a child's head in the mirror, sounds of heavy
objects</B>
<P><B>being moved in the wall-to-wall carpeted apartment, sounds of wood
being</B>
<P><B>stacked in the living room, seeing shirt-tales and other things out
of</B>
<P><B>the corner of one's eyes, and the mysterious 7 pm crash in the
cottage</B>
<P><B>next door to the house (we believe the cottage was once a
blacksmith's</B>
<P><B>shop).  </B>
<P><B>The truely odd thing about the house was that after we moved out (not</B>
<P><B>due to the ghosts but to the landlords) was that we knew the people
who</B>
<P><B>moved in and when we asked them about occurances they said that they</B>
<P><B>noticed nothing.</B>

<H3><A NAME="my house">My House</A>
</H3><P><B>by bparrack@kwic.com </B>
<P>
<P><B> I moved here 10 years ago with my mom and dad, and my uncle's</B>
<P><B>family, everything was fine for me, although I was only 6. My mom and
my</B>
<P><B>aunt believed to hear footsteps through our house and coming down the</B>
<P><B>stairs.  They heard these many times and thought someone was in the</B>
<P><B>house, but there was never anyone here, this freaked them out.</B>
<P><B>    About 6 years ago my family was having a yard sale, and a woman
got</B>
<P><B>out of her car and starred at our house for the longest time, she
then</B>
<P><B>asked my mom if she could go inside. She said she had lived in the
house</B>
<P><B>as a child.  My mom gave her a tour of our house, and the woman began
to</B>
<P><B>fill us in on some of the history.  There had been funerals in our</B>
<P><B>living room, and many people had died in our house.  This explained
the</B>
<P><B>footsteps in our house, always seeming to come from upstairs.</B>
<P><B>    The footsteps still continued, and up until a few months ago,
thats</B>
<P><B>all that ever bothered us about the house.</B>
<P><B>    In February of this year, my mom was sleeping upstairs, in the
room</B>
<P><B>where people had died in, she swore to me and the rest of the
household</B>
<P><B>that she had saw a man standing at the top of the stairs, he was tall</B>
<P><B>with black hair and a long beard, she described him to what she had
saw</B>
<P><B>and to everyone else living here, it sounded like a man that looked</B>
<P><B>evil.....</B>
<P><B>    Another event that happened was my best friend Wes, usually
spends</B>
<P><B>the night a few times a week, and stays up on the computer, I have
a 6</B>
<P><B>year old sister, and Wes heard a little girl saying help me as she</B>
<P><B>approached him, he turned around thinking it was my sister, and there</B>
<P><B>was no one there, he went to my sister's room and she was sound
asleep.</B>
<P><B>Another one of my close friend's name is Matt, he is a frequent
visitor,</B>
<P><B>and he also saw the man and heard the little girl's voice. Matt's</B>
<P><B>description of the man fit my mom's perfectly.</B>
<P><B>    Another incident that happened, my mom, Matt,Wes, and myself were</B>
<P><B>all down stairs in the living room, talking about all the evidence,</B>
<P><B>which leads us to believe there are spirits here, and the pipes</B>
<P><B>upstairs, started up. They only do this when someone is running</B>
<P><B>water,Wes yelled "STOP",and the stopped for a second and made a long</B>
<P><B>moaning sound, which was followed by voices, although you couldn't
make</B>
<P><B>out what they were saying.</B>
<P><B>    Another 2 incidents have happened within the last month, Matt
dared</B>
<P><B>his friend Peter to go upstairs and stay up there for 5 minutes,
after</B>
<P><B>we had told him about all the stories.  Peter went upstairs and
realized</B>
<P><B>he had  to go to the bathroom, so he went down the hall, and got to
the</B>
<P><B>bathroom door,which is usually open, it was closed, and you can only</B>
<P><B>lock it from the inside, he turned the doorknob, and it would not
open,</B>
<P><B>then when it finally opened the lights began to flicker on and off,
he</B>
<P><B>ran downstairs, and is now a believer that our house is haunted.</B>
<P><B>    The last one is really weird, all the other times something has</B>
<P><B>happened it was during the night, this was in the middle of the</B>
<P><B>afternoon, and my mom was folding laundry in our dining room, there
is a</B>
<P><B>chandoleer over our dining room table, one of it's light bulbs fell
out</B>
<P><B>of its socket, broke in the air, and hit the table, as soon as it hit</B>
<P><B>the table it started on fire!! This really freaked us out.</B>
<P><B>    Although we know our house is haunted, we are going to stay, they</B>
<P><B>haven't did anything to harm anyone yet, and they are just ghosts
with</B>
<P><B>unfinished business.....</B>

<P>
<P><B>my family has had many ghostly encounters that seemed to follow us</B>
<P><B>wherever we moved.  i remember back quite a few years ago when my</B>
<P><B>parents lived in this apartment.  many eerie sounds and sights
occured</B>
<P><B>there. one time i stayed overnite and shared my sister's room.  i
awoke</B>
<P><B>in the middle of the nite to use the bathroom.  it took a lot of
talking</B>
<P><B>to myself to open the door and walk through the dining room and
living</B>
<P><B>room to the bathroom.  as i proceeded through the rooms, i felt</B>
<P><B>something following behind me.  the rooms were cold and the sense of</B>
<P><B>evil was present.  i ran into the bathroom and slammed the door and
as i</B>
<P><B>looked i saw the door knob turn.  at this point i was petrified
knowing</B>
<P><B>i had to go back out there.  it took me 20 minutes to get up the
courage</B>
<P><B>to open the door and run back to my sister's room.  as i did this
this</B>
<P><B>"presence" chased me.  i slammed the bedroom door and jumped on the</B>
<P><B>bed.  at that time the door flung opened and whatever is was sat down</B>
<P><B>beside me.  my sister rolled under the bed and pushed as far back as
she</B>
<P><B>could by the wall.  i was shaking so bad but a calmness came over me
as</B>
<P><B>i remembered something someone had told us.  i began to recite the</B>
<P><B>lord's prayer and as i did the thing rose from the bed and went out
of</B>
<P><B>the bedroom closing the door behind it.  we discussed what had
happened</B>
<P><B>the next morning with our parents and unfortunately this was not the</B>
<P><B>first time nor was it to be the last time.</B>

<H3><A NAME=message>Grandfather's Message</A>
</H3><P><B>by 	rvesey@intercall.com </B>
<P>
<P><B>Well I don't know if you would like to put this down as a ghost seeing
experience which I have had plenty of those as well but this story I tell
you is absolutely true and means a lot to me and is always hard to tell cause
of the emotions involved with it but I feel that if this is a serious Web
page about such phenomenon then it might help support the beliefs of life
after death. </B>
<P><B>               My experience began one night while sleeping. I don't
remember when it started but it felt very real and I know and don't question
that it was real. I walked from room to room looking for the right one. For
some reason my mother wasn't with me this time and the lights in the hospital
hallway were off. Except for the red glow of the emergency exit signs and
a bright light that extended from the bottom of a huge   closed door at the
end of the corridor, all were off. Still walking and looking at the numbers
on the doors, I felt a cool breeze lightly drifting about. Then there he
was appearing... no materializing right before me. My grandfather, a very
tall man, stood before me looking down with sorrowful eyes and patting me
on the head told me that he was no longer with us, that he had passed on.
As he kneeled before me and put his hands on my shoulders and told me this,
I felt something pass between...no through him and into me. He smiled a little
then stood back up patted me on the head again and started walking towards
that huge door with the light and as he did the door slowly opened and people
stood inside with the light glowing around them and waved for him to enter.
I think that it was the strength and brightness of the light but he began
to dissolve into the light and as he did I woke with a shaft of sunlight
coming in through my window. Then I heard her. My mother downstairs on the
phone crying as the people at the hospital gave my mom the news of my
grandfathers death just minutes before they called her. When I walked down
stairs. She was about to tell me with tears streaming down her face. I told
her I knew...that I already knew. I told her that he told me. She looked
at me with puzzlment and I told her exactally what I wrote here.</B>
<P><B>         My grandfather passed something over to me and to this day
I can feel my grandfather's presence with me and watching me. Wherever I
go he's there</B>
<P><B>         So, to all you people looking for hope of life after. Yes,
I believe...no in my own way I know that there is more. We live a whole life
of experiences both big and small, for what to die and be no more..thats
it. I think not. I know not and so do you.</B>

<P><B>About 13 or 15 years ago. My grandparents owned a house In Arkansas,
close</B>
<P><B>to a little town called Jacksonport. My mother was the oldest of 3
kids,</B>
<P><B>witht he youngest, my aunt, still living at home.  On my visits to
the</B>
<P><B>house I was always terrified for no specific reason.. Without Fail,
I would</B>
<P><B>shiver and quake all night and Never get any sleep. I personally never
saw</B>
<P><B>anything there, Just felt a prescence. But late on night, I'd say around
2</B>
<P><B>a.m or so I was reading on the couch in the living room, and Heard
My</B>
<P><B>grandmother scream.. Now this was a woman who could and would stand
toe to</B>
<P><B>toe with any man on this planet.. a full-blooded cherokee inidan, She
was</B>
<P><B>afraid of Nothing... So Naturally I was terrified.  I walked into
their</B>
<P><B>bedroom to find Grandma sitting bolt upright in bed, whiter than the
sheet</B>
<P><B>she lay on.. When I asked her what had happened she said that A man
had sat</B>
<P><B>down beside her on the bed and stroked her hair. She thouht it was
my</B>
<P><B>grandfather and turned to greet him but on turning no-one was there.
Then</B>
<P><B>just as she was thinking it was just a dream and about to go back to
sleep,</B>
<P><B>a vision as she called it appeared.  She said the same man just
materalized</B>
<P><B>in the doorway and told her that we must leave the house in the next
2</B>
<P><B>weeks. She said that he didn't seem Threatening or mean in any way,
just</B>
<P><B>concerned. Well my Grandfather said it was a Load of S#*T and stayed..
Two</B>
<P><B>weeks to the day after this vision.. The White River overran it's banks
and</B>
<P><B>flooded Jacksonport, and the house that my Grandparents lived in. They
sold</B>
<P><B>the house while it was still in a state of disrepair and never entered
it</B>
<P><B>again..The river has since stayed in it's banks and I drive by every
once</B>
<P><B>in a while just because I have too to get where I'm going..But I always
get</B>
<P><B>an eerie feeling just by looking at it... thanks for listening..</B>

<P><B>It is so nice to find people who take this seriously for a change and</B>
<P><B>not the usual sceptics who listen to you telling your experiences and</B>
<P><B>then nodding in agreement with a wry smile.</B>
<P>
<P><B>My Mum, sister and myself have been told that we are quite psychic.
 We</B>
<P><B>can tell if there is a presence wherever we are.  I am too old now
at 26</B>
<P><B>to have an over active imagination, so I know what occurred is true.</B>
<P><B>Here is one of many incidents that have happened to me.</B>
<P>
<P><B>My parents were on holiday and my sister, who is 8 years older than
me,</B>
<P><B>and myself were the only ones in the house.  We have separate
bedrooms</B>
<P><B>at either end of a landing area.  We had spent the evening in
watching</B>
<P><B>TV, locked up the front and back doors, checked the windows were
locked,</B>
<P><B>turned all the lights off and retired to bed.  We both always shut
our</B>
<P><B>bedroom doors completely, and my door handle is particularly stiff
and</B>
<P><B>it can be heard distinctly when I open or shut my door.  It was just</B>
<P><B>after midnight when I heard footsteps coming up the path and to the</B>
<P><B>front door and then stopped.  My room is directly over the front door</B>
<P><B>and I am quite a light sleeper so this was not difficult to hear, and
I</B>
<P><B>was not dreaming it.  I turned on my light, opened my noisy door,</B>
<P><B>turning on any available light there was, stood at the top of the
stairs</B>
<P><B>and shouted "Is there anybody there", no reply.  I then went down the</B>
<P><B>stairs and entered the lounge, kitchen, dining room, again turning
on</B>
<P><B>the lights, there was nothing there.  I then felt I had imagined it
and</B>
<P><B>went back to bed.  I never mentioned this to my sister as I didn't
want</B>
<P><B>to worry her or most of all, let her think I was being daft.  The
next</B>
<P><B>night I heard nothing, but my sister most certainly did.  She asked
me</B>
<P><B>two days after my incident, had I been up in the night and gone</B>
<P><B>downstairs for a drink.  I told her that I hadn't and puzzled asked
her</B>
<P><B>why.  She told me that she had heard footsteps downstairs, which then</B>
<P><B>came up the stairs but then stopped.  She apparently had shouted my
name</B>
<P><B>to make sure I was alright, when I hadn't replied she had opened her</B>
<P><B>door and gone onto the landing, the lights were all off and there was
no</B>
<P><B>one there.  I then told her about my experience 2 nights previously</B>
<P><B>which we could both not explain.  We weren't worried though as my</B>
<P><B>sisters father had died in that house, our grandma had died in my
room</B>
<P><B>and many other relatives had died previously.  All we could think was</B>
<P><B>that one of them had come to make sure we were alright, without our</B>
<P><B>parents, and that we were tucked into bed.</B>

<H3><A NAME=hands>Rainbow Hands?</A>
</H3><P><B>by name withheld by request</B>
<P>
<P><B>    Let's start of this story with a little bit of an introduction.
 I grew up in a house built right before WWII.  To my knowledge I know of
no tragic deaths that occured in the house, although I do remember a previous
owner telling me about her son being killed in Vietnam.  My parents have
lived in the house since 1974.</B>
<P><B>    Since I was a small child I have felt uneasy when left alone and
would rarely stay in a room by myself.  As I got older I hated being home
alone and would turn on lights in all connected rooms and shut the doors
to all the others.  I was very afraid of the upstairs and would not venture
there alone until I was 13 and even then the hall light had to be on and
the bedroom doors closed. When I moved up there I would not go into my room
without a flashlight because the lightswitch was behind the door and I didn't
want to be in the dark even in the few moments it took me to turn on the
light.</B>
<P><B>   Now to my story:</B>
<P><B>    When I was little I used to see things that I called "rainbow hands."
 They were multicolored arm shaped objects that I would see everywhere when
I was little.  I remember they usually appeared around walls and seemed to
be reaching out of them.  I also remember that upon occasion I would wake
up to see a rainbow hand above my head sticking out of the wall. </B>
<P><B>    The rainbow hands didn't scare me until I got older.  I stopped
seeing them for awhile and decided that they were due to my overactive
imagination.  But then one day I saw one reaching out of the kitchen wall.
 I closed my eyes and reopened them and it was gone.  I started to think
that I was looney.  I was only 10 or 11 and hadn't learned yet that ghosts
weren't always white and see through, but could come in many forms.</B>
<P><B>    One day I was talking to my Aunt when I mentioned the rainbow hands
and she said that she used to see them too, but only out of the corner of
her eye.  This freaked me out really bad and for a long time I slept with
a nightlight on.</B>
<P><B>    I haven't seen any rainbow hands in a long time... maybe 7 or 8
years now.</B>
