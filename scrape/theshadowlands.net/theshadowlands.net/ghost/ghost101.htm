<P>
<P><B>This may not be one of the more exciting tales that you've heard, but
I </B>
<P><B>assure you that it's true.  My name is Lindsay and I am 16 years old.
 My </B>
<P><B>best friend has claimed to be a bit psychic and has proven his abilities
</B>
<P><B>several times.  He enjoys freaking me out by reading my mind and knowing
what </B>
<P><B>I am doing while I talk to him on the phone.  He told me that he used
to have </B>
<P><B>"guardian ghosts" when he was little that only appeared by his bedside
when </B>
<P><B>he was woken up by nightmares.  However, as I do not know the whole
story </B>
<P><B>behind his ghosts, I am writing about a different instance where his
"powers" </B>
<P><B>came in handy.  One more note on him:  he can astral-project, meaning
that he </B>
<P><B>can send his presence places while his body is sitting comfortably
at home.  </B>
<P><B>He has only done this with me once, when I was upset and crying while
I was </B>
<P><B>on the phone with him.  </B>
<P><B>	Now for my experience.  I was on the phone with my best friend, as
</B>
<P><B>usual.  It was about midnight and we had been having a very serious
</B>
<P><B>conversation.  I was getting very upset and was curled up on my bed
with the </B>
<P><B>phone.  We had both been silent for about a minute when I felt a presence
in </B>
<P><B>my room.  I said, "You're here, aren't you?" thinking that he had projected
</B>
<P><B>himself into my room.  He told me that it wasn't him.  Suddenly I was
hit </B>
<P><B>with a feeling of pure hatred and evil.  Though I couldn't see anything
out </B>
<P><B>of the ordinary, I knew exactly where the thing was.  I huddled into
the </B>
<P><B>corner of my bed as I slowly became hysterical, saying, "There's something
</B>
<P><B>here, get it out, oh, it's here and it's bad!"  He told me to block
my mind </B>
<P><B>and that he would help me.  I kept saying "It's here, it's in here"
until he </B>
<P><B>almost yelled at me "No, it's not, Lindsay, it's here!"  I've never
heard him </B>
<P><B>say anything that angrily.  We were silent again for about 2 or 3 minutes,
</B>
<P><B>until I worked up the courage to ask him what happened.  He said that
it was </B>
<P><B>gone; that he had fought it off, whatever it was.  We decided that
our </B>
<P><B>serious conversation had probably just opened up a window to some bad
karma </B>
<P><B>and it had manifested itself in an almost physical form.  For the next
few </B>
<P><B>days, I avoided my room as much as possible, and we decided to keep
the </B>
<P><B>serious conversations to a minimum for awhile.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>Entities</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: Laura753@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>I have had several experiences with entities mostly I believe evil.
 They </B>
<P><B>seem to be "attracted" to me.  When I was about 5-8 my sister had a
poster of </B>
<P><B>E.T. that I was deathly afraid of.  Its eyes would follow me and on
more than </B>
<P><B>one occasion I saw it wink! I think it might be a spirit working through
it.  </B>
<P><B>When we moved from that house I had the guts to rip it in half.
 Incidentally </B>
<P><B>my sister told me last year that she was deathly afraid of it too but
kept it </B>
<P><B>because it scared me.</B>
<P><B>   Then when I was ten I had just turned out my nightlight and was
starting </B>
<P><B>to snuggle under the covers when I felt someone tucking the blankets
around </B>
<P><B>me.  I was real sleepy so at first I thought it was my mom but the
second I </B>
<P><B>realized she went to bed hours ago, I flipped on my back and two
disembodied </B>
<P><B>hands started choking me! My spirit left my body (this *is* possible)
and I </B>
<P><B>ran down to my parents room screaming to help me.  When I realized
I wasn't </B>
<P><B>there I was back in my bed.  I was not dreaming because I had marks
on my </B>
<P><B>neck and I remember the time exactly when I turned out my light.</B>
<P><B>     Then when I was thirteen in my house I now stay in one night I
was </B>
<P><B>meditating and when I was down I went to blow out my candles and I
looked out </B>
<P><B>the window I saw a short man all in black with glowing red eyes!! 
I couldn't </B>
<P><B>move and I was petrified until finally I ran to the bathroom.  Soon
afterward </B>
<P><B>I could feel a presence in the room and I had horrible nightmares.
 I packed </B>
<P><B>all my stuff up and moved to the empty room next door.  I went back
later and </B>
<P><B>blessed the room in the name of my Goddess and haven't felt it since.</B>
<P><B>      When I was sixteen me and my friend, her boyfriend and my boyfriend
all </B>
<P><B>went to this graveyard one night  because if you went through this
clearing </B>
<P><B>you can jump on top of the crypts and hang out. (It was the boyfriends
idea.) </B>
<P><B> They were talking amongst themselves and me and Tiffany were quiet
when I </B>
<P><B>heard a little girls voice directly underneath say help me in a whisper.
 It </B>
<P><B>kept on for a while every couple of minutes and kept getting louder.
 I </B>
<P><B>noticed that everytime it happened Tiffany was looking around and I
asked her </B>
<P><B>if she heard it.  She said "Ya it says help me"  The guys never heard
it.</B>
<P><B>       A little time after that I was riding in a truck with friends
and a </B>
<P><B>big swirl of fire leaped across the road.  It looked almost like a
tumbleweed </B>
<P><B>the way it swirled.  I wasn't on drugs or anything. Neither of my friends
saw </B>
<P><B>it.</B>
<P><B>        Then sometime this year (currently 19) I was riding along with
a </B>
<P><B>friend when I looked out the window and I saw this thing running along
the </B>
<P><B>side of the car.  I thought it was a large black dog and I watched
as it </B>
<P><B>moved ahead of the car and then darted in front! I screamed "Watch
out" but </B>
<P><B>it disappeared.  My friend thought I was crazy.  I wasn't just a shadow
</B>
<P><B>because I saw four legs moving.  But if it was the ghost of a dog it
was huge </B>
<P><B>one.  It was almost the size of a baby deer.</B>
<P>
<P><B>If anyone has had similar experiences especially with the hands and
a poster </B>
<P><B>please email me @ Laura753@aol.com.  Thanx and blessed be!</B>

<P><B>Gettysburg Reenactment Offices Ghost</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: Budpatch@aol.com</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B>I am, by nature, a believer in ghosts, UFO's, and that type of thing.
My mom </B>
<P><B>works at Gettysburg's Regimental Quartermaster in Pennsylvania. She
has a </B>
<P><B>bunch of friends there, and they're all moms. I know everybody there,
every </B>
<P><B>inch of the store and offices. But when Mom said that she'd seen a
ghost, I </B>
<P><B>was highly skeptic. My mom loves to make up these types of stories,
so I </B>
<P><B>didn't believe her. (My mom's side of the family rules for campfire
tales and </B>
<P><B>legends.) My mom's friends, all of them, have also claimed to see the
ghost. </B>
<P><B>Before my mom worked there, she was a skeptic, but know she is a true
</B>
<P><B>believer. My cousin came to town from New York a few weeks ago- he's
30, and </B>
<P><B>I'm 13. He wanted to go to Gettysburg, so we decided on bike riding
all over </B>
<P><B>the battlefield. We covered 11 of the 17 miles of a tour road around
the </B>
<P><B>battlefield. We thought that before we'd leave, we'd say hi to mom.
It was </B>
<P><B>about 9 pm as we got there. I saw, outside, and man in a carpenter's
outfit, </B>
<P><B>red shirt, belt with tons of accessories, ya know, hammers, etc. We
went </B>
<P><B>inside then, and said hi to everybody. While my cousin became engrossed
in a </B>
<P><B>chat with my mom and her friends, I went over to the door that seperates
the </B>
<P><B>store from the back offices and upstairs offices. As I looked into
the closed </B>
<P><B>store, I saw  the same guy from outside, working and hammering the
floor, but </B>
<P><B>he emitted no noise. Then, the door creaked a bit, he turned, looked
at me, </B>
<P><B>and turned again, and walked up the stairs to the upstairs offices.
I looked </B>
<P><B>further in, and he walked through the front door! My mom's reaction,
simply </B>
<P><B>to my story was, "Oh, you saw him too?"</B>

<P><B>Ghosts Follow Me</B>

<P><B> </B>
<P>
<P><B>I'm 17 years old I lived in many different places and every house
I've</B>
<P><B>lived in has been "haunted." But theyr'e friendly ghosts, I mean they
play</B>
<P><B>with our heads just to let us know that they're there.  They never
hurt</B>
<P><B>us.  They move things, play with my 2 year old brothers toys. I believe
that</B>
<P><B>their is two ghost, one that we named bob, he's been around since I
was</B>
<P><B>little. But recently my little brothers twin died at birth and he
plays</B>
<P><B>with toys and my little brother that is alive will just sit there and</B>
<P><B>carry on a conversation with no one. Me and my mom believe that he
talks</B>
<P><B>to his brother and only he can see him .</B>

<P><B>My Paranormal Experiences </B>
<P>
<P><B>BY: donhunt@net-link.net</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>Following this last encounter I decided it was time to seek council
from</B>
<P><B>someone more familiar with the paranormal in an effort to make some
sense</B>
<P><B>out of what was happening to myself and my family. I was fortunate</B>
<P><B>enough to have become friends with a fellow service member whose wife
had</B>
<P><B>worked for a time at The Whaley House in southern California. After</B>
<P><B>relating to him some of the details of our ordeal he assured me that
she,</B>
<P><B>too, had experienced encounters with the paranormal and would be most
interested</B>
<P><B>in hearing what I had to say. I made arrangements to meet with her</B>
<P><B>at her earliest convenience.</B>
<P><B>Cheryl was a very warm, gregarious women and put me at ease
immediately.</B>
<P><B>She encouraged me to be open and honest about everything that I had
experienced</B>
<P><B>and convinced me that she would believe everything I had to say.</B>
<P><B>She had always been sensitive herself she said, was well versed in
the</B>
<P><B>use and interpretation of Tarot Cards, and had participated in a
great</B>
<P><B>number of successful seance and Ouija sessions. I began my tale.</B>
<P><B>After I had finished Cheryl immediately suggested that she and my
wife</B>
<P><B>and I make arrangements to meet the following weekend for a Ouija
session</B>
<P><B>at our apartment. She advised me not to purchase a board when I told</B>
<P><B>her we did not own one. She claimed that they were dangerous and</B>
<P><B>that she would create a "disposable" one when she arrived. As I left</B>
<P><B>her I was both anxious and apprehensive awaiting the weekend.</B>
<P><B>The following Saturday evening Cheryl arrived as planned and she
immediately</B>
<P><B>asked for a tablet of paper, a felt tipped marker, and a roll of
adhesive</B>
<P><B>tape. She proceeded to create her Ouija Board, fashioning it out of
individual</B>
<P><B>squares of paper and taping them to our kitchen tabletop. She then</B>
<P><B>asked if we had a wine glass, which we gave her, and this she placed
upside</B>
<P><B>down in the middle of her unique creation. She instructed us to
lightly</B>
<P><B>place two fingers each on the bottom of the inverted wine glass and,
shortly</B>
<P><B>after we did as she instructed, she began asking questions to "our
spirit".</B>
<P><B>The results were immediate and amazing.</B>
<P><B>The wine glass became animated and moved so swiftly that we literally</B>
<P><B>could not keep our fingers upon it. It initially traveled just inside</B>
<P><B>the perimeter of the board in ever increasing circles. As Cheryl</B>
<P><B>asked questions, it would spell out the answers and then continue on
it's</B>
<P><B>frenzied, circuitous journey as before.</B>
<P><B>Judging from the answers we received during the course of our
questioning</B>
<P><B>we all surmised that our ghost was actually "my guardian spirit" and
had</B>
<P><B>been with me since birth. She was, according to the answers we
received,</B>
<P><B>responsible for every paranormal experience I (and my Mother) had
ever</B>
<P><B>witnessed. Her name was "Rachel" but she indicated that she preferred</B>
<P><B>that everyone other than myself refer to her as "Z". When my wife,</B>
<P><B>during the course of our questioning, addressed "Z" by her given
name,</B>
<P><B>my "guardian spirit" became highly agitated as the wine glass
suddenly</B>
<P><B>shot out from beneath our fingers and struck my wife in the collar
bone.</B>
<P><B>Cheryl suggested that we immediately terminate the interview at that
point.</B>
<P><B>She proceeded to remove all of the paper squares used to create our</B>
<P><B>makeshift board from the table and burned them in our kitchen sink.
Following</B>
<P><B>this, she took the wine glass we had been using as an
oracle/planchette</B>
<P><B>and poured a liquid into it that she had gotten from a container in
her</B>
<P><B>purse. She mumbled something, drank the liquid from the glass, washed
it</B>
<P><B>in the sink and returned it to my wife.</B>
<P><B>Cheryl then sat down with us and explained that in her estimation
"Rachel"</B>
<P><B>evidently considered me to be her property, so to speak, and was
extremely</B>
<P><B>jealous of any other female that challenged her authority in that
regard.</B>
<P><B>She stated that "Rachel" was also very empathetic to my emotional
state</B>
<P><B>and would tend to "display" more often when I was ill at ease or in
a state</B>
<P><B>of emotional distress or confusion. She suggested that my wife's and
my</B>
<P><B>recent reconciliation following a brief separation and my upcoming
release</B>
<P><B>from the service were likely contributing factors to the frequency
and</B>
<P><B>intensity of our recent experiences with her. She was somewhat
concerned,</B>
<P><B>she said, about "Rachel's" blatant hostility toward my wife but felt
that</B>
<P><B>as our lives returned to normal "Rachel" would follow suit. She was
right</B>
<P><B>for the most part. Until shortly after we moved.</B>
<P><B>Following my release from the service we returned back to the Midwest</B>
<P><B>and lived for a brief period of time with my in-laws. During this
time</B>
<P><B>my wife gave birth to our youngest son and our experiences with
Rachel</B>
<P><B>became nothing more than an unbidden recurring memory. By May of</B>
<P><B>1977 I was gainfully employed again and by the following month we
were</B>
<P><B>able to secure a townhouse which we leased for a year. Shortly after</B>
<P><B>our arrival in our new home Rachel decided it was time to become
reacquainted.</B>
<P><B>She began innocently enough. Intially the T.V. just began changing</B>
<P><B>channels by itself again. Then we noticed that the water taps would
shut</B>
<P><B>off by themselves as we washed dishes, bathed or showered. Usually
it was</B>
<P><B>the hot water that would be slowly extinguished, leaving us to wash
in</B>
<P><B>icy cold water. Unless, that is, Rachel was upset with us for some</B>
<P><B>reason. Then it was the cold water, scalding us until we realized</B>
<P><B>what was happening and could defeat her efforts. The faucet knobs
would</B>
<P><B>visibly turn to the right and be shut off. It took us awhile to
notice</B>
<P><B>this but we eventually did. We became accustomed to keeping an eye</B>
<P><B>on the faucets so we could thwart her attacks. I should stress here
that</B>
<P><B>while I say "we", and I did witness many of these occurrences, I was
not</B>
<P><B>subject to them personally. When I say "we" I mean my wife and
extended</B>
<P><B>family or friends that came to visit us. I should also note that</B>
<P><B>Rachel never harmed or attempted to frighten the kids. I did,</B>
<P><B>however, feel the effects of the furnace when it began turning on by
itself</B>
<P><B>during the summer months and the air conditioning turning on in the
winter.</B>
<P><B>It got to the point where my wife and I trained ourselves to
subconsciously</B>
<P><B>listen for the almost imperceptible click of the thermostat control
so</B>
<P><B>we could react quickly and accordingly. As odd as it sounds, these
daily</B>
<P><B>interruptions to our lives became almost commonplace and second
nature</B>
<P><B>until they were brought to our attention (sometimes hysterically) by
our</B>
<P><B>houseguests. At which point we attempted, as rationally as we could
considering</B>
<P><B>the circumstances, to explain the phenomena. We were, for the most
part</B>
<P><B>able to assuage their fears. That is until my friend Dave spent the</B>
<P><B>night.</B>
<P><B>Dave was a life long friend of mine who called me unexpectantly one</B>
<P><B>cold wintry night and explained that he had been physically evicted
from</B>
<P><B>his apartment by his wife, under threat of death should he attempt
to remain,</B>
<P><B>he claimed. He desperately needed a place to stay until she calmed
down</B>
<P><B>and became rational so I, of course, invited him over immediately.</B>
<P><B>He arrived at our townhouse shortly thereafter carrying a sleeping
bag</B>
<P><B>and an overnight case containing what little he was able to stuff
into</B>
<P><B>it as his wife chased him around their apartment. He filled me in on
all</B>
<P><B>the juicy details of their latest argument and then, reluctantly, I
was</B>
<P><B>forced to bid him good night as it was getting late and I had to get
up</B>
<P><B>for work very early the following morning. He was settled in his
sleeping</B>
<P><B>bag on the living room couch watching T.V. as I headed upstairs to
bed.</B>
<P><B>I didn't see Dave for a very long time after that.</B>
<P><B>&gt;When I awoke the following morning and headed downstairs for my
coffee</B>
<P><B>and car keys I immediately noticed that while Dave's sleeping bag,
shirt</B>
<P><B>and shoes were still laying on the floor where he had left them the
preceding</B>
<P><B>night, he and his pants were no where to be found. Somewhat alarmed
I immediately</B>
<P><B>went to the kitchen window, looked out into the parking lot, and
noticed</B>
<P><B>that his car was also gone. Had his wife called him at our house and
begged</B>
<P><B>him to come home? With a phone in our bedroom we would have surely</B>
<P><B>been awakened by it's ringing. And Dave had assured me that his wife
had</B>
<P><B>no idea where he had gone. Had he called her perhaps? If so, why</B>
<P><B>then hadn't he dressed before he left? Especially considering the</B>
<P><B>extreme cold and with a foot of snow on the ground. There had</B>
<P><B>to be a reasonable explanation. Or so I hoped.</B>
<P><B>Returning home from work that night I immediately attempted to
contact</B>
<P><B>Dave by telephone at his apartment. The operator informed me that</B>
<P><B>his line had been temporarily disconnected (I later learned that it
had</B>
<P><B>been ripped from the wall during he and his wife's argument). Growing
more</B>
<P><B>concerned I then called his brother and was relieved to hear that he
had</B>
<P><B>indeed returned home to his wife the previous night. The
circumstances</B>
<P><B>regarding his sudden, half nude, departure from our house however was
going</B>
<P><B>to be left for Dave to explain. But Dave made no effort to contact
me at</B>
<P><B>all.</B>
<P><B>Two weeks to the day later I was finally able to contact Dave by
telephone</B>
<P><B>at his apartment. He assured me that he and his wife were doing fine</B>
<P><B>again and then, oddly, asked me if I would personally return or mail
to</B>
<P><B>him the belongings he left at our house that night. I suggested that</B>
<P><B>he stop by for them one evening and fill me in on the details
surrounding</B>
<P><B>his sudden departure but he emphatically refused. In fact, he stated</B>
<P><B>that he would never again set foot in our house if he had anything
at all</B>
<P><B>to say or do about it. I was extremely perplexed at this point and
it took</B>
<P><B>me two months and a 12 pack of beer to finally pry the story out of
him.</B>
<P><B>During which time I held his possessions hostage.</B>
<P><B>It seems that shortly after I had gone to bed that night Dave decided</B>
<P><B>that he should also get some sleep. He told me that he gotten up</B>
<P><B>from the couch and turned off the television and then slipped back
into</B>
<P><B>his sleeping bag. Almost immediately after he had settled in, facing</B>
<P><B>the back of the couch, he said that someone tapped him on the
shoulder.</B>
<P><B>Assuming it was me, he turned over to face where he thought I would
be</B>
<P><B>standing and saw only the darkened living room. As my Mother had</B>
<P><B>years earlier, Dave said he came to the immediate conclusion that I
was</B>
<P><B>messing around with him and simply rolled back over to go to sleep.
As</B>
<P><B>soon as he did , he said, came the shoulder tapping once again. He</B>
<P><B>claimed that he jumped up and turned on the lamp at the end of the
couch</B>
<P><B>hoping to catch me as I ran to hide and was surprised to find the
living</B>
<P><B>room, once again, empty. Somewhat unnerved but, again blaming me, he
turned</B>
<P><B>off the light. This time deciding to face the living room. The
tapping</B>
<P><B>now came from behind the couch. He ignored it. It came again. He,</B>
<P><B>again, refused to acknowledge it.Suddenly, he said, one end of the</B>
<P><B>couch, with him on it, was propelled approximately three feet into
the</B>
<P><B>air and dropped to the floor. He struggled out of the sleeping bag</B>
<P><B>and bolted straight upstairs to where my family and I slept. He
stood,</B>
<P><B>he said, outside our bedroom doorway for almost ten minutes, torn
between</B>
<P><B>awakening us or fleeing. After calming down he decided to go to the
bathroom</B>
<P><B>and return to his sleeping bag, having rationalized that what he had
experienced</B>
<P><B>could be attributed to that nights activities with his wife. He
returned</B>
<P><B>downstairs and headed for the half bath located directly off of the
kitchen.</B>
<P><B>As he approached the bathroom doorway he said that the bathroom light
suddenly</B>
<P><B>turned on by itself and then the door slammed shut directly in his
face</B>
<P><B>missing him by only fractions of an inch. That was the final straw.</B>
<P><B>He grabbed his pants from the floor near the end of the couch (he
would</B>
<P><B>have left them too he said had it not been for the fact that they
held</B>
<P><B>his car keys) and ran for the outside door. As he ran through the
snow,</B>
<P><B>struggling to get into his pants, he claimed that as he looked back
toward</B>
<P><B>the apartment windows the bathroom curtains parted and then the light
went</B>
<P><B>out. Dave held true to his word and never returned to our apartment
again.</B>
<P><B>I delivered his belongings to him personally as he requested.</B>
<P><B>Still more to tell, soon.</B>

<P><B>Haunted School</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: tmatassa@sprint.ca</B>
<P>
<P><B>        </B>
<P><B>This story is about a haunted school my dad worked at called Prince
Edward</B>
<P><B>Grade school .  My Dad is a janitor there.  One night, my Dad took
me and</B>
<P><B>my sister along with my cousin to work with him.  He had the night
shift. </B>
<P><B>We were in the staff room when the lights begin to flicker.  At first
we</B>
<P><B>thought it was a storm.  My sister looked out the window, but there
was no</B>
<P><B>sign of a storm.  And then, my Dad told us there was a ghost at the
school.</B>
<P><B> The story goes like this:  As a new janitor with the school system,
you</B>
<P><B>must work for at least two months at Prince Edward School.  This school
is</B>
<P><B>haunted by a ghost, and as a result, no one wants to stay there and
work,</B>
<P><B>especially at night.  After that, you can choose a different school
to work</B>
<P><B>at.  My Dad, decided to stay there after his two months, going on
three</B>
<P><B>months now.  </B>
<P><B>The lights continued to flicker, and we were getting more and more
scared. </B>
<P><B> So my Dad was going to take us home.  He was used to strange things</B>
<P><B>happening.  Many times he would be cleaning a classroom, and even
though</B>
<P><B>the doors and windows were all shut, heavy things would come flying
off the</B>
<P><B>shelves onto the floor.  Also, he was used to the lights flickering
on and</B>
<P><B>off.  Before we left that night, my Dad told us to shut off all the
lights.</B>
<P><B> My sister went into the music room to shut those lights off when a
tuba</B>
<P><B>fell onto the floor.  No one else was in the room but her.  Next,
before</B>
<P><B>she could get out of the room, the drums played for a second.  So she
ran</B>
<P><B>out of the room and down the stairs.  As she was running, she heard</B>
<P><B>footsteps behind her.  When she reached us, the footsteps stopped.
 after</B>
<P><B>that, we left.  Enough ghosts for us!</B>

<P>
<P><B>I have written in some other"experiences"  but this is the first one
I</B>
<P><B>can remember. When I was about 7 or 8 we moved to this little town
and</B>
<P><B>into this really  old house, I hated it. As soon as we moved there
our</B>
<P><B>cat started acting strange, she'd jump up on tables and</B>
<P><B>counters(something we'd NEVER let our cats do) Then she ran away and
we</B>
<P><B>never seen her since.Anyway we had a hard wooden floor and me and my</B>
<P><B>younger sister would play a game of rolling marbles back and forth
it.</B>
<P><B>But sometimes right in the middle of the floor in mid roll it would
stop</B>
<P><B>and roll back to us like someone was sitting in the middle of the
floor</B>
<P><B>and was rolling it back . But that only happened a couple of times
and</B>
<P><B>we just thought the floor was uneven or something. Anyway the way the</B>
<P><B>house was built me and my sisters room was way down a long hall all
by</B>
<P><B>ourselfs, in our own little wing,.I always hated that, It creeped me</B>
<P><B>out, the whole house creeped me out. So at night I would always have
the</B>
<P><B>light on in our closet, The way our rooms were there was a long walk
in</B>
<P><B>closet connecting me and my sisters room and the closet doors had
almost</B>
<P><B>wooden blinds little slots so you could always see in the closet(that</B>
<P><B>freaked me out too)</B>
<P><B> my bed was facing the closet door, and with the light on in the</B>
<P><B>closet(there was</B>
<P><B>a light bulb in there)so I could see right in from my bed.Anyway one</B>
<P><B>night I was sound asleep and all of a sudden for no reason at all I</B>
<P><B>suddenly woke up (or maybe I just dreamed all this)anyway as soon as
I</B>
<P><B>was wide awake I could see a silhouette in my closet, I was terrified</B>
<P><B>but I tryed to calm myself down by asuring myself it was just a
jacket</B>
<P><B>or something, but then the silhouette walked across the door stopped</B>
<P><B>faced towards me for a moment and continued to walk into my sisters</B>
<P><B>room. I was so terrified</B>
<P><B>I was scarred it would do something to my sister, but I just layed</B>
<P><B>there, scared to death,..</B>
<P><B>After a while I told myself it was a dream and I finally got to
sleep..I</B>
<P><B>know it sounds like I made it up but I SWEAR it's true or an
incredible</B>
<P><B>dream.Since then we moved</B>
<P><B>but I was good friends with the people who moved into the house, all
I</B>
<P><B>know is they ripped out the closet , I'm not sure if they've
experienced</B>
<P><B>anything</B>

<P>
<P><B> When I was little my family just moved in to a house in Des Moines
and the </B>
<P><B>first night we stayed there I had to sleep on the couch in the living
room with me being </B>
<P><B>the oldest in all. Well lets get on with the story, okay here's what
happened </B>
<P><B>I got up to go to the bathroom [in the middle of the night] I came
back and </B>
<P><B>the last thing I saw was my covers and my pillow I shut my eyes I opened
them </B>
<P><B>up and I saw a man right in front of me he almost looked like an Amish
guy </B>
<P><B>after that I just froze then I put my head under my covers and screamed
mom </B>
<P><B>dad!and after that the ghost never came back. </B>

<P><B>The Orange Cat-among other things</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: blb3404@airmail.net</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P>
<P><B>I lived in an old rock house built earlier in the century, occupied
most</B>
<P><B>of the time by an elderly lady, till her death, then the house became
a</B>
<P><B>rental. My family and I lived there for about a year, there was my</B>
<P><B>parents, myself, and two brothers. I was 17-18 at the time and
occupied</B>
<P><B>two different rooms of the house while I lived there. Within the
first</B>
<P><B>week of living there we noticed an orange cat going into a
bedroom-later</B>
<P><B>to be mine-from the kitchen. We did own a lot of cats-13 to be exact,</B>
<P><B>but none were orange. We didn't feel threatened at all-after all it
was</B>
<P><B>just a cat. It always went into that room-never anywhere else. A
later</B>
<P><B>observation was made-when we let any of our cats into the house-they
all</B>
<P><B>immediately ran to that bedroom and wanted to stay there. In that
room</B>
<P><B>later on in the year-the chandelier began to swing rather violently
one</B>
<P><B>night while I was occupying the room. I made a quick check of the</B>
<P><B>windows and the outside door-they were all closed-therefore it
couldn't</B>
<P><B>be the wind. It suddenly stopped just as it had begun-and it was</B>
<P><B>automatically still-it wasn't a slowing down process-one minute it
was</B>
<P><B>swinging so fast I was sure it would hit the ceiling, the next it was</B>
<P><B>still. In this same room there were two doors connecting to adjacent</B>
<P><B>rooms. Because of the age of the house and the humid weather, the
doors</B>
<P><B>were quite swollen and most of the time one had to kick them to get
them</B>
<P><B>open. One night one of them started to swing open and shut by itself.
I</B>
<P><B>watched in disbelief, thinking surely someone was doing it-but there
was</B>
<P><B>no one. I hollered out-"I know your there." I had been told ghosts
only</B>
<P><B>wanted to be acknowledged-it was the only thing I could think of to</B>
<P><B>do-after that I just covered my head and waited-it stopped. The only</B>
<P><B>other thing that ever happened like that was to my oldest brother.
He</B>
<P><B>was alone in the house one day and heard knocking on the wall in the</B>
<P><B>bedroom next to his. A female voice calling his name followed the
knocks</B>
<P><B>and he assumed it was me calling to him. He went to the bedroom and</B>
<P><B>found it empty. He searched the entire house and found himself still</B>
<P><B>alone. I came home about 2 hours after the fact and he was still
pretty</B>
<P><B>shaken up. None of us ever felt threatened or felt oppressed.
Whatever</B>
<P><B>was in the house was not evil we believe, we aren't sure what it was,</B>
<P><B>but we never felt like running scarred. The house is still being
rented</B>
<P><B>last I heard. </B>

<P>
<P><B>My name is Lisa-Marie and I am 13 years old. My story</B>
<P><B>started when I was about 3. I woke up on day and saw a</B>
<P><B>man wearing a suit stood in my room. When I got up the</B>
<P><B>next day I asked my mum who had been to my house.</B>
<P><B>No-one had visited that night. I kept seeing the man</B>
<P><B>every now and then for the next few years. I once</B>
<P><B>asked who he was and he said "John". When I was about</B>
<P><B>11 I went to my local library and looked at the old</B>
<P><B>papers. I found out that a guy called john had died in</B>
<P><B>my room about 30 years ago. I have still seen him</B>
<P><B>since then, normaly in my room or on the landing.</B>

<P><B>A Story from a Friend</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: XTTiggerX@aol.com</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P>
<P><B>This is not a personal experience, but that of a friend.  Her mother
had been </B>
<P><B>recently divorced, and decided to buy a cute little house for herself,
and </B>
<P><B>her two daughters to live in.  The house was that of an elderly lady,
who was </B>
<P><B>confined to a wheel chair.  Before they moved in, the place need a
good </B>
<P><B>cleaning, and some of the carpets need changing.  Most notably the
one </B>
<P><B>upstairs which had been the woman's bedroom and  where she painted
with oil </B>
<P><B>paints, because there had been a worn path from the wheels on her
wheelchair </B>
<P><B>through the upstairs room where the lady had spent most of her time.
 The </B>
<P><B>girls took the upstairs room and there mother was downstairs.  In the
</B>
<P><B>beginning my girlfriend would hear noises during the night, but would
think </B>
<P><B>it was either the house settling, or her imagination.  Then as she
started to </B>
<P><B>smell paint for no apparent reason, with or without the windows open,
breeze </B>
<P><B>or no breeze, night or day.  The sounds then became more defined, and
would </B>
<P><B>happen more often.  She told me that it sounded as though someone was
moving </B>
<P><B>around her room, she would hear the squeak of wheels and the smell
of paint </B>
<P><B>was strong.  I never had the impression of fear from her, she often
joked and </B>
<P><B>said, "It was her room before it was mine, and she has every right
to be </B>
<P><B>here."</B>
<P><B>In the three years they lived in that house, before they moved out
of state, </B>
<P><B>the carpet in her room had to be changed three times because the same
worn </B>
<P><B>marks that had been there when they first bought the house kept coming
back.</B>
