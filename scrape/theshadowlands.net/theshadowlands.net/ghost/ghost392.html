<p class="MsoNormal">i'm actually a psychic and can sense and see an entity. when
i was in my freshman year in college i experienced a chilling sensation when a
ghost placed his hands on my shoulder, and i knew he was a ghost for my back
was leaning on a window. another was when i was reading my notes for an exam. i
saw this girl.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">she was wearing white and it was bloodied. she ran towards
the balcony of the third floor lobby, looked at me and jumped, landing on the
second floor lobby. i knew she was a ghost the minute i checked the second
floor lobby from the balcony of the third floor. at first she was lying,
facedown on the floor in a pool of blood. then she vanished. another instance,
was when i was having my on the job training in one of the busiest areas of
manila (i'm from the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">philippines</st1:country-region></st1:place>).
i was on the 14th floor, and i was busy combing my hair, near the office where
i'm doing my practicum, when i saw this girl by the mirror. there was a
reflection but no one near the mirror. no one was at the corridor because it
was lunch time.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Hello there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
cousin and I one evening went for a walk on the Wilkinson trail at the Saratoga
Battlefield.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It happened to the
Veteran's Day weekend, which I claim as significant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anyway, it was a beautiful night with a full
moon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was dark by the time we got
about a quarter of a mile out on the trail.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My cousin was on the phone when I started to hear gunshots.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I at first attributed it to neighboring houses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But after she got off the phone and we
listened, we relized they werent coming from the neighbors at all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The shots became more rapid and closer
together. Some sounding as if they were coming from the bushes right next to
us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This went on for a couple of minutes
before we heard what sounded like a dozen horses galloping toward us through
mud!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That only lasted about 15
seconds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But it was at that point that
we decided to turn back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We didnt run
back, worried we'd miss out on something more.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And the whole walk back we would hear an occasional gunshot from the
bushes nearby!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We declared it a
haunting!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">About 5 months ago, it was discovered that there is a ghost
at my ex-boyfriend's house. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The first encounter was when they (he, his mother and
stepfather) returned from a family trip and as they walked in the door, his
mother noticed that the fireplace poker, instead of hanging, was suspended
horizontally in the air--then fell.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
caused the dog to start barking.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ever
since then, the hauntings have gotten worse.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Because a few weeks later, his stepfather said he saw a
shadowy figure coming up from the basement steps.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, a couple of days later, his mother said
that she saw the same shadowy figure in the same area.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She said that she sensed that it was a male
spirit.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Then a few weeks after this, during a visiting, I was in the
bathroom taking a shower when I heard the bathroom door open then close.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I also had the sensation of being
watched.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So I hurriedly got out of the
shower and out of the bathroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And as I
was running to his room, I turned around and slowly shut his bedroom door but
before I closed it, I saw a shadowy silhouette of a man with no head and huge,
black, deer eyes that had a glossy appearance.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That&#8217;s when I slammed the door and hopped into the bed and covered my
head with the blanket.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">All this time, my ex-boyfriend said he had never seen the
ghost.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was up until yesterday
(April 20, 2006). </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">During our phone conversation, he stopped in mid sentence,
gasped, and said, &#8220;Holy ****, you are right, it does have deer eyes!&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had just seen the ghost standing in front
of the basement fireplace.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">In conclusion I just want to say that it seems to favor the
fireplaces in the home. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The Haunted Summerhouse</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">My girlfriend, Lunas family has had a summerhouse on the
danish isle of Fanoe since 1931, and travels over there every once in a while.
Recently i went with her and her family to spend the easter there. M y
girlfriend and i, were always the last to go to bed, and would often stay up
until 1 or two in the night.the first night, my girlfriends mother had just
gone to sleep, and me and Luna was watching tv. Suddenly the sound of someone
eating, started coming from the livingroom/kitchen. It was the sound of a fork
and knife against a plate. I thought Lunas mother had gotten up to have a late
snack, but was surprised to find out that the room was empty. The sounds
immediatly stopped when i entered the room. Both me and Luna was frightened,
and went to bed. Next night, everybody else had gone to bed, and Luna was
afraid of hearing the spooky sound again, so she went to bed. I wanted to watch
some tv, and stayed up alone. It started out fine, but after a while, i got an
eerie feeling of someone being in the livingroom. I checked, and it was empty.
I decided to stay up and ignore it, since i was watching a good movie. But then
the sound of slow, heavy footsteps, like the one of an elderly person, started
coming from the livingroom. I started feeling very uncomfortable, and went to
bed. Next morning, we were all eating breakfast, and Lunas grandma, who owns
the house, tells that when her husband was alive, he would go to bed early, and
she would stay up. But she always ended up rushing in to her husband, since she
had the feeling of someone being in the livingroom and hearing footsteps. I was
very surprised, cause i had not told them about my experince the night before.
But after hearing her story, i told her that i had fealt the same. Anyway, on
our way home from the trip, Lunas father picked us up at the main railway
station in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Copenhagen</st1:place></st1:City>.
We talked about it, and it turned out that he had experienced the same. I do
not know who it is visiting my girlfriends summerhouse, but i dont think it is
anyone with evil in mind. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Hello, I've been enjoying your website for a few years , and
have just not gotten around to sharing my experiences till now.When I was
little we lived in an old house in Lincoln Nebraska- probably built around
1900.It was a cool house by today's standards, craftsman era... etc.. with all
the appropriate nooks and crannies . The other oldest home in the neighborhood
was right next door to ours and it had a flat roof on one side with french
doors leading out onto the roof top.My earliest memory of something
"different" was remarkable mostly because of its ordinariness, if
that makes any sense at all.I remember it was a spring day, I was alone in the
side yard, and I looked up onto the flat roof next door.There I saw a young man
and a young woman(probably 18 to 20 years old) they were dressed in clothes
from another time.., I would say the 1920"s though I didnt realize that
till<span style="">&nbsp; </span>much later. they were kind of
gliding across the roof top.They smiled at me and waved to me and I smiled
back. that was it. The old man who lived there lived alone though.I NEVER saw
those people again.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Anyhow, in our house , I used to see a bluish haze,
sometimes at the top of the stairs leading to, you guessed it, my room! I
always got the distinct feeling that this "hazy thing" could see me.
Other times I would notice it in my room, over my bed , etc....One of the
oddest things I recall from that house was the<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>time my brother , sister and I all decided to play a game of tag in
the<span style="">&nbsp; </span>totally darkened living<span style="">&nbsp; </span>room , a game which we called ghost.we were
playing and at one point my brother and I were facing the huge fireplace
standing side by side with my sister about ten feet behind us.Suddenly the
interior of the fireplace became lit up with multiple glowing moving
"lights"which appeared almost in the shape of<span style="">&nbsp; </span>bubbles which were made only of light. r a
split second I felt as if I were floating toward the ceiling, then it was all
over. Well, we turned on the lights immmediatly and never played that game again.
My sister said she saw the lights too,this was all so long ago , it's kind of
easy to discount it, but I know what I saw.I also have quite a few photos with
very bizarre streaks of white though them, taken at different times with
different cameras in vastly different locales. I'm talking about streaks of
white which seem to be three dimensional with a shadowy side to them and
sometimes a sort of zooming almost puffy appearance. They look like photos you
guys have on your site, not sure what to make of them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In print these experiences pale next to most
of the others, but<span style="">&nbsp; </span>they were definitely
enough for me. Thanks for letting me post...</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Unexplained Occurrences</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: ladymadison22@yahoo.com </p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I have read many of your encounters with ghosts and I guess
you can say that I feel I'm finally comfortable enough to share mine. For some
time now, I have tried to force my expereiences with the unexplained out of my
memories. But recently I have decided that it is best to cope with it and share
what I have been through to help others into not thinking they have either gone
crazy or are alone in the world. I can remember the first time I started
believing in ghosts. I was 4 years old and living in a house in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Wheaton</st1:City>, <st1:State w:st="on">IL</st1:State></st1:place>
with my parents, 2 sisters, and older brother. Since it only had 3 bedrooms, my
sisters and I had to share a room that happened to be on the opposite side of
the house from the other two bedrooms. In our room we had an abundance to toys
(like most children do), a couple dressers, a bunk-bed that my sisters slept
on, and then my bed. Every night before we went to bed, my mother would make us
pick up our toys. After she was satisfied and tucked us into bed, I soon fell
asleep. I woke up in the middle of the night to the sound of someone rummaging
through the toys in the closet. Thinking it was one of my sisters, I sat up and
peered into the closet that was a few feet away from the foot of my bed. My
eyes had become adjusted to the darkness but I couldn't see anyone in there. I
figured that whichever one of my sisters it was, had noticed that they'd woken
me up and was trying to be quiet so I would go back to sleep. I layed back down
on my bed and was about to drift off to sleep when I heard the noise again of
toys hitting other toys. I sat up and again and this time I yelled for whoever
it was to be quiet. When the noise didn't stop, I got out of bed and walked to
the closet door. When I got there, I saw a little girl, about my age, sitting
on the floor and she was going through a small toy chest that we kept in there.
I got really mad and hollared for her to be quiet or I was going to go and get
my mother. Whe the little girl didn't stop but just kept digging into all the
toys, I got so mad that I just slammed the closet door shut and marched back to
my bed. When I layed back down, I noticed that the noise had stopped and looked
over to the bunkbed to see if the noise, or myself, had woken up my other
sister. That's when I began to get scared because I could see in the darkness
that BOTH of my sisters were sleeping soundly in their beds. I even got up to
check and make sure that they were really there sleeping before I climbed back
into my bed and fell asleep. I never mentioned anything to any of my family
memebers and it wasn't long before my parents divorced and we moved out of that
house. A couple of years later the house was torn down. I'll tell one more
encounter that I had and I'll try to keep this one a little shorter than the
last. The rest of them I'll share at a later time. This one happened at a house
in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Walworth</st1:City>, <st1:State w:st="on">WI</st1:State></st1:place> where my family (my father had remarried
and I had another sister) lived for 16 years. I went through some pretty scarey
things there that I STILL to this very day, have not shared with any of my
family memebers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But one thing sticks out
the most in memory as that scariest that happened. I believe I was either 12 or
13 years old at the time and had just gotten my own room on the upstairs of the
house. The house was built in the early 1900's but that is all that I know of
the history of it. But anyways, I had shared the room with my new sister for
years and never had any problems. But one night, I had a friend stay over and
we decided to play truth or dare. Now the basement to this house is creapy. I
mean, spiderwebs everywhere, dust, this place was scarey. It reminded me of
eithr a tomb, or a tunnel from an Indiana Jones movie. There was a door that
led downstairs to it, but during the remodeling of it my parents decided to
take out the door and cut the stairs short. Instead, they placed a floor board
over the stairs to get into it. I know that probably doesn't make alot of
sense, t just imagine walking into a room and having to lift a square piece of
the flooring up to see a set of stairs leading down to a dark basement. With
that said, it was my turn and my friend dared me to go down to the basement and
stay there in the dark for 10 minutes. It was late and everyone was in bed so
nobody heard us leave my room and make our way downstairs and head towards the
small room where the stairs to the basement were. I tried to act all big and
bad about it, like nothing would bother me and I wasn't scared at all. But as
soon as that flooring closed over my bed, let me tell you I could feel my heart
racing so hard it felt like it would beat right out of my chest! I started
breathing hard and goosebumps completely covered my body. I didn't venture down
any farther than the one step I was sitting on, and I waited impatiently for
the 10 minutes to be up. It was the longest 10 minutes of my life! With nothing
but darkness around me, I started to become petrafied when I heard something
being dragged on the other side of the basement. It happened to quickly that I
just sat there and didn't breathe in fear that whatever it was would notice me.
When the dragging stopped, I could hear footsteps slowly making their way along
the wall of the basement towards the stairs. I was still holding my breath and
looking towards where the sounds were coming from. Out of the darkness, I swear
to you, I saw a pair of yellow cat-eyes coming towards the stairs and when they
stopped there they looked up at me. At first I couldn't move, but when I heard
the footsteps again coming up the stairs where I was sitting and the cat-eyes
got closer I pushed the floor board up above me and practically jumped, instead
of climbed, out of the basement. I bolted like I was on fire out of the room
and up the stairs to my bedroom. I don't remember seeing my friend when I left
because the only thing on my mine was getting out of there..and fast. I'm sorry
that this was so long but I'll try and make the next ones shorter. Thank-you
for king the time to read this.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The year was 1954, it was summer time in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Portland</st1:City>, <st1:State w:st="on">Oregon</st1:State></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is the year I moved into the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">leadbetter</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Castle</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I would turn nineteen later that year, anyway I had applied for a job as
a parking valet at the Vista St Clair apartment house which was on a hill in
the expensive part of town. Well I did not get the job there, but did get a job
a few blocks down from there at a parking garage, worked swing shift
mostly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After I was there for a couple
of weeks Mr. Fitzgerald the Manager of the Vista St Clair apartment house came
in to pick up his MG, he was glad I had found a job and then asked me where I
was living, I told him me and a buddy were sharing an apartment on the other
side of town.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He then asked if I would
like to move over closer to work, he said he needed someone to mow a lawn and
take care of the shrubs, and he would provide them room and board so I asked my
boss if I could take off for about an hour, and off we went in his MG man you
could have blew me away when he pulled into this huge castle, I mean all stone,
three stories high with a huge entryway.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Anyway he gave me a tour and said I could have any room I wanted, and
that there were only two others living there besides him, Lars who was the
manager of the Mt Hood ski lodge, and Bob who was a buyer for Olds and King
department store.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well, naturally I said
yes and the next week I moved into the place.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They had beds, dressers, and all kind of extra furniture in the
basement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anyway I decided to move into
the Library on the first floor, all paneled with mahogany shelving, and<span style="">&nbsp; </span>glass doors awesome room, but did not stay in
that room long as to far to walk to a bathroom.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Then I moved up to the second landing where all the other guys were
staying , of course the three suites were taken but had three other single
rooms that shared a bath, but did not stay there to long ether, as after I had
explored the entire castle I found a suite with it&#8217;s own bathroom on the third
floor. The other rooms up there were servants quarters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I Did not have to walk up the stairs as the
place had an elevator.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&gt;From the day
I moved everything I wanted into this suite of rooms I<span style="">&nbsp; </span>felt as if someone were watching me, but as
an eighteen year old did not think much about it.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>They had converted the pantry into a small
dining room and kitchen so that&#8217;s where we ate the big dining room was empty,
but probably could have seated 100 easy.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The main floor had a Living area with a huge fireplace that was probably
ten feet tall at least, and if you looked up you could see the railing running
around the second floor where all the suites were located, also next to the
dining room was a huge ballroom, and oh yes the Main dining room had a
dumbwaiter as the big kitchen was in the basement...the place was so big that
it is hard to describe.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was told that
the Castle had been brought over from <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">England</st1:place></st1:country-region> brick by brick in the late
1800s, and electricity added around 1920.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It had a unloading door where horse and carriage brought visitors they
would step right out of the carriage into an atrium.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Bob the buyer for Olds and King got married
while I lived there and I drove Lars up to MT Hood when winter showed up...He
had someone try to teach me to ski, but that was a laugh could hardly stand on
them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Anyway before that happened I saw my very first ghost and
only one of two that I ever saw in three dimension and in color.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had got off of work about eight PM had
taken a bath, and was standing in front of the mirror shaving, when I saw a
woman in the bathtub smiling at me, at first I thought that the other guys
living there who were always pulling jokes on me had sent her up and somehow
she had sneaked by me and got into the tub, but when I turned around to look
directly at her she was still smiling at me and then she just vanished.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I think every hair on me was standing
straight up and I have to say I was more then a little frightened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Funny thing is I can still see her in my mind
today, she had red hair and<span style="">&nbsp; </span>green eyes
and was stunning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I know she was wearing
something but cannot remember that as I was staring into her eyes almost the
entire time, that was probably no more then 30 seconds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">A few years ago, I was teaching at a small private school in
<st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Charlotte</st1:City>, <st1:State w:st="on">NC</st1:State></st1:place>.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Each year the board of directors sent the entire faculty on
a working retreat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These trips were
really quite fun and helped us bond, I always looked forward to them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One year we traveled to the foothills of NC
and stayed at a lovely historic inn.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There was really very little to do outside the inn and conference
center.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We had classes each day, our
meals were taken as a group.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After our
first day and evening, my roommate and I were very tired and decided to go to
bed instead of staying up with our fellow (and much younger) faculty
members.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We got ready for bed and turned
up the heat in the room, because it was a very cool evening and our room seemed
to be unheated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Late that night I woke
up because I was very cold.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As I started
to reach for the cover, I felt the bedspread being pulled up and over my
shoulders.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was a very sweet and
comforting feeling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I assumed my roommate
had gotten up to<span style="">&nbsp; </span>turn up the heat or go
to the bathroom, so I turned over to thank her for being motherly, and to my
utter astonishment, she was across the room in her bed, sound asleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I looked around the room, but didn't see
anything.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The room suddenly felt warmer,
and though a bit startled I did not have any feelings of fear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I rolled back over and went back to
sleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The next morning, I asked my
roommate if she had gotten up the night before, but she said she had not.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I decided not to mention my experience.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At breakfast, the owner of the inn spoke to
our group about the history of the area and the inn.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She laughingly said she had been surprised
that nobody in our group had said anything about ghosts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Seems the inn has quite a reputation as a
ghostly place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I never mentioned my
experience to anyone at my school.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I did
tell my story to my husband and parents.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They all seemed to think I had imagined or dreamed the event, but I KNOW
I was awake and I did have a visitor of some sort that night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, it was not a frightening
experience...just odd.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If I had seen
something or someone, my feelings might be different.</p>

  Carolina</st1:place></st1:State></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Hello. I've written before about strange hauntings that have
occured to me throughout my life. Most of the stories have taken place in
various houses I have lived in for some time, but this story is about my
Boyfriend's Mother's House, in Elizabeth City, NC.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Unfornatly back in the beginning of 2004, my BF's mother got
very sick and passed away. The family and myself where with her (and that's
another story of it's own - let's say her late husband came back to get her
that morning). </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Afterwards, when all was said and done, my BF was cleaning
out some of his possesions (they kicked us out of the house - his sister is not
a nice person), we where their late one evening. This would be the last time I
felt comfortable in this house.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I had my car in the driveway and he was inside going through
boxes in the living room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was moving
things around in the backseat &amp; trunck to make more space when the
passenger front door closed by itself. I thought nothing about it and just
re-opened the door and went inside. Since the house is out in the counrty side,
I left all 4 doors and trunck open.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I found my BF sitting in the living room, cleaning out some
boxes and sat down with him. All of a sudden I heard a sound, like a music box,
faintly playing somewhere. I went dead still and my BF noticed and asked me
what was wrong. I asked him if he heard the music. He gave me a strange look
and told me no. We went back to cleaning and finally got another load to go out
in my car. We headed out and I noticed that the doors where half closed on my
car and the trunck was almost shut. I made note of it, but we just packed the
car. My BF went back inside while I adjusted things and again, the doors
partialy closed. At this point I knew it wasn't the wind, the trees (and there
are ALOT of trees around there) were not rustling. I walked around the car and
stopped.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I felt like there was someone standing behind me, less than
a foot back. I was motionless for about 30 seconds then took off toward the
house. As I crossed the threshold, I felt whatever was following me stop,
haulted by the door. Who/what ever it was, was very angry at me for going back
inside, I could just feel the emotion being aimed at me from inside the
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My BF noticed how scaried I
looked and came over. At this point, I told him about the car doors and the
"person" who is standing outside the front door, pissed as all
heavens.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">He sorta stared at me for a second then told me that him
mother sometimes felt that someone had tried to get into the house before. That
and she ways saw "shadow people". He always caulked it up to her parnoia,
but now he was wondering if it was something more. He spent a couple of mintues
calming me down then went back to work.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">We finished cleaning and got ready to leave, I could hear
the music-box music again. I turned to see if I could pin-point it and saw
something move out of the corner of my eye. I screamed and dashed out of the
house, running to the car. BIG MISTAKE. The "person" who had followed
me before, was back, right at my heels. I was scared silly. I got in the car,
started it and told my BF to get inisde the car NOW!</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">He came out, locked up and got in. I tore out of the
driveway like the devil himself was on my tail. My BF was trying to get me to
slow down, but I took off down the backroad, doing close to 55. I could feel
that "person's" angre and rage, and how it wanted to get at me. About
2 miles down the road, I stopped feeling it and slowed down. We went to his
brother's house and chilled for awhile.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">On the way home, we had to pass by the house. It was dark
now, so you coulnd't see much as this was the counrty and there weren't many
street lamps. As we got nearer that house, I got more frightened than I ever
have in my life. Passing the house didn't cause anything new to happen, but I
swore to myself that I would NEVER go back in that house again.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">There is so much for me to tell, but this time I will only
tell of the one time I knew without a doubt that my experiences aren't my
imagination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Last night (Fri., April 14,
2006) my brother and I went to two local cemetaries to record EVP and take some
pictures with my digital camera.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I took
31 total pictures.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All but one or two
had "orbs" in them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Some had
just 3-4 but most had at least 15.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
know they aren't always orbs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not much
happened at the first cemetary as far as EVP.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There was one instance where I said something like, "There's only
two." My brother replied with a<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"hmm".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Over his voice
was a man saying "seven".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Toward the end of our short visit there, I turned to look behind me for
some reason.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As I did so, I saw a shadow
zip by.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It didn't really have
shape.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was just there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The second cemetary is one we have visited
several times.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It's like we feel drawn
to it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was my first time recording
EVP.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Two minutes into the recording I
asked, "Wh is your name?"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All
was quiet for about 15 seconds then I got an answer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A female whispered, "Annie" plain
as day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was nothing for two
minutes after then she whispered it again.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Several minutes went by and I said I was about to turn off the recorder
so if anyone had anything to say to do so then.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A few seconds later, as I opened my mouth to say goodbye, a male
whispered something that sounded like, "secrets".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On my brother's microcassette recorder two
voices could be faintly heard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
sounded like a man and woman talking.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hearing the famale say "Annie" freaked us both out a bit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have always believed in the
paranormal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It's just that when you see
a shadow or something you may wonder if it's your mind or eyes playing
tricks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With this EVP, there's no
doubting what happened.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">We moved into this townhome in Sept 2004 for additional
space. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">On the walls in the basement are weird paintings of The Eye
and Greek and Egyptian characters and I suspect some occultish type stuff.
These are a little creepy but painted over with white paint so we thought it
was just some previous tenant being stupid.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">From the day we moved in until the day we moved out it
seemed like our cat was constantly charging all over the house. He was
constantly spooked by something. He would run up and down the stairs, hide
under the covers, race all over the place.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">About 7 months into our occupancy I was standing at the top
of the stairs and felt 2 hands try and push me down the stairs. I grabbed at
the handrail to prevent myself from falling. I turned and no one was there. I
went downstairs and everyone was downstairs and there was no other way up
except the stairway I was using. This freaked me a little because the pressure
was such that I felt the finger marks on my back for quite a few minutes.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Then we bought a new house and prepared to move out. Then
things REALLY got weird. The cat got more spooked and was almost
hyperventilating. We had the game TV downstairs and it was switching itself on and
off. My step sons bedroom light was off when they were not there. I came home
one day to find the light on. I mentioned it to my husband and we thought the
boys had called by for something yet we later confirmed they hadn't been NEAR
the place because they were staying at respective friend's places. The
maintenance people had not been in or they would have left a note. Noises form
downstairs, banging etc.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">This made my husband say that he was real glad we were
moving.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The day we moved into the new house the cat has been just
fine. No crazy behavior. And no spooky lights turning on and off our TV's.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The strange thing was the cat was spooked at my husband's
previous apartment as well but not as much. One night my husband woke to see a
little black girl and boy beside his bed. He turned on the light and they were
gone. In the morning his son (without prompting) mentioned that 2 black kids
were in his room the previous night.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Being Left Alone</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I am the youngest of three children and I was at one time
'babysitted' by an older brother and sister.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Since I've grown and they are married and moved away, I am usually the
one that is alone on weekends to fend for myself or in the evenings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I do not like being alone at all in the house.
When I had someone with me it was ok, but now I am hearing and seeing alot of
strange things.....I never told my family what I see or hear. I just don't
think they'll believe me at all. I usually get yelled at alot during the
evenings because I will have every light burning in the house...THERE IS A VERY
GOOD REASON YOU KNOW...I am not trying to up the electric bill or anything!!!
But there are instances where I was freaked out to the point I had to leave...I
even have witnesses, who are old friends, to back me up on this. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The first instance was when my friend, Denise, and I were at
my house and we were completely alone. We were talking in the kitchen and
getting something to drink when I heard the voice of my brother's girlfriend
now his wife, Lynn, say "<st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Taylor</st1:place></st1:City>?"
I didn't think anything of it till <st1:PersonName w:st="on">Denise </st1:PersonName>said
to me first, "Did <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Lynn</st1:place></st1:City>
come home already?" I said, "She must have." And proceeded to
say "We're in the kitchen <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Lynn</st1:City></st1:place>."
After a couple of minutes when she did not appear, <st1:PersonName w:st="on">Denise
 </st1:PersonName>walked into the family room and yelled, "<st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Lynn</st1:place></st1:City>?" She came back
and said, "<st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Taylor</st1:place></st1:City>
she's not here." We walked through my whole house and was calling for her
but she wasn't there AT ALL. Then we heard her voice AGAIN, it sounded like she
was clearing her throat, and it came from the room we just walked out of. We
went back in that room again....and there was no one there. Her car wasn't in
the driveway and usually my dogs will alert the family if there is someone at
the door. It was total silence from my dogs that day. I brought this up to <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Lynn</st1:place></st1:City> later that evening.
"<st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Lynn</st1:place></st1:City>, did
you stop by today?"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And she said,
"No, I was at work all day."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
got goosebumps when she said that...because if she never came to our
house....then just who or what impersonated her voice?? </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The second instance was when I was completely alone. My
mother loves to hang pictures of us on the walls...and she has a very cute
drawing of my niece and nephew that was drawn at an amusement park a few years
back. She has that hanging just outside her bedroom at the end of the hall. And
she has placed right underneath it a shelf with statues on it....the tallest
statue being of the Virgin Mary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again I
was in the kitchen, studying for a test, and it was completely quiet because
everyone was working that afternoon. Suddenly I hear, CRASH! I thought to
myself, "What the heck was that?" And I walked down the hallway.
There was the pic of my niece and nephew, it appreared that it was picked up
and THROWN across the hall and was laying FACE UP on the floor. That is completely
impossible, because if it had fallen on it's own, it would have either knocked
down several of my mothers statues or the whole shelf itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>NOTHING WAS TOUCHED. Not even the Virgin
Mary. Again the goosebumps. I quickly packed up all my books, I did not touch
the drawing at all, just left it lying on the floor, and I went to my friends
house that afternoon. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Maybe there is a good reason for both of those
incidents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If you know, please by all
means tell me! It has been very quiet around my house lately but at night, when
I'm alone, (I live in the country where there are woods all around my house) I
just get a creepy feeling. Like I'm being watched.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But it doesn't feel like it is coming from
the outside, I can walk outside at night and be just fine (Thank God I'm a
country girl). The feeling is coming from the inside of my house. I try to make
as much noise and turn on as much lights as possible....it's not so bad when
both the tv and the radio is blasting.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And even when there is someone at the house with me, I'm ok.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But when I'm left alone</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Hello, there</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My name is Fred, and I just wanted to share an experience
that has kinda haunted me for years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You
see, I used to live in <st1:City w:st="on">Lima</st1:City>, <st1:State w:st="on">OH</st1:State>,
which as you know is the location of one of the many bridges in this nation
labled <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Cry</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Baby</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Bridge</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I used to think that Lima was unique in that
one aspect, but tonight, almost ten years after my experience, I find myself
sitting at my computer looking up all I can to learn the real legend behind
that road, only to find that <st1:City w:st="on">Lima</st1:City>, <st1:State w:st="on">OH</st1:State> isn't the only place with a <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Cry</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Baby</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Bridge</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I've already found reference to two different ones, besides <st1:City w:st="on">Lima</st1:City>, in <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>
alone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That isn't even counting all the
others spread across the country.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well,
I can't vouch for the others, but the one in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Lima</st1:place></st1:City> truly exists, and isn't just a
legend.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I wish to share my account of
what happened to me nearly ten years ago on that road, plus some of the other
stories I've heard about the surrounding area.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">First of all, I can't really remember what year it was, only
that I was between the ages of fifteen and seventeen and I'm currently twenty
six.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This would place it right around
ten years ago, but my memory of the evening is still vivid in my memory; including
the feelings surrou ing my experience.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I grew up in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Lima</st1:City>,
 <st1:State w:st="on">OH</st1:State></st1:place>, and heard stories all my life
about supernatural occurances on <st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">Greely
  Chapel Rd.</st1:address></st1:Street><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The road, by all accounts, seemed to be a sort of lightning rod for
ghostly presences, and its appearance certainly lends credence to such
claims.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One night my friends and I
decided to check out what everyone refered to as <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Cry</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Baby</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Bridge</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We all piled into a friend's truck and headed out for the road.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">As I said above, the road has many stories surrounding it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I can't personally validate all of the
stories, but I would like to share them all anyway.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before we set out that night, we got to
talking about the road.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Someone
mentioned a house that you pass right as you turn onto the road.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Apparently this house had been abandoned for
nearly a decade, the power had been shut off long ago, but the porch light was
always on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When we passed this house,
sure enough the porch light was on, but none of us had the courage to go and
find out if it was deserted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Another piece
of superstitious nonsense that we talked about was the classic story of the
headless motorcyclist.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You know, the
story about the motorcyclist who wrecked his bike and was decapitated on a stop
sign, and, supposedly, if you shine your breaklights on the stop sign you'll
see a ghostly image of his blood pouring down from it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once again, not validated by me, so we'll
move on to what I DID experience. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">There's a story of a truck, a BIG truck, with lights all
around it that prowls the road.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
truck is not natural by any means.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I'm
not sure about its backstory, but supposedly, if you drive down <st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">Greely Chapel Rd.</st1:address></st1:Street>
with any intention other that getting from point A to point B, this truck will
try to run you off the road.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There's
also a story of a man in a farm house who commited suicide by shooting himself
under the chin with a shotgun.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The man
in the story s described as having a long, white beard and wearing denim
overalls.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally was the story about
the bridge itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The actual bridge, it
was said, is not actually on <st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">Greely
  Chapel Rd.</st1:address></st1:Street>, but the stream that the original
bridge crossed over intersects with it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If you drive over this bridge at night (doesn't matter what time, trust
me), there is a board on it that creaks and sounds exactly like a baby
crying.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The actual bridge is way back in
the woods located at the end of the road and can only be reached by foot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was said that a cabin stood back there in
the 1800's, and that a woman lived there by herself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She had a child shortly after her husband had
been killed and was forced to raise the baby alone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One night the baby's crying became too much
for her to handle so she drowned it in the stream outside of her cabin.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She then went back into the cabin and killed
herself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You better watch yourself if
you try to travel back there, however, since the story also tells of the man
with the shotgun in the overalls chasing away anybody who tries to make the
trek.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Now for the actual account of what happened that night some
ten odd years ago.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">We piled into a friend's truck and headed for <st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">Greely Chapel Rd.</st1:address></st1:Street><span style="">&nbsp; </span>As soon as we saw the beat up white picket
fence that marks the entrance to the road, I felt a chill run the length of my
spine and the hairs stand up on the back of my neck (I can't look at white
picket fences without getting that feeling to this day).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We traveled the length of the road to the
point where the stream intersects with it and turned off the radio.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Just to increase the silence so we could hear
better, we pulled up to the bridge and put the truck in neutral to let it roll
over the bridge and rolled down the windows.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Sure enough, we heard the sound of a baby crying as it ran over a
certain board.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I'm certain that it was
just the creak of the board that made this ound, but the resemblance to a
baby's cry was too unmistakeable to dismiss.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My friend, the one who owned the truck we were in, suggested that we go
to the end of the road and travel back into the woods to find the actual
location where it was said the woman drowned her baby.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When we got to where the road curves off into
a different direction, we got out of the truck.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I immediately noticed an extremely run down barn right by the entrance
to the woods.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I could have turned and
run right there, but I didn't really feel like doing so on this particular road
while my friends kept on going, so I went with them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We didn't even get into the woods when we
heard a gunshot coming from the barn.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
turned to look and a man with a white beard wearing overalls came charging from
the barn with a shotgun.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We hopped in
the truck and headed back in the direction we came from.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We thought we were alright and that it was
all over.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, when we started
nearing the beginning of the road, I and my other friend in the seat beside me
noticed that there was a really bright light coming from behind us that kept
getting brighter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When we turned to look
there was a huge truck directly behind us, almost touching our rear
bumper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lights on the truck were so
bright we couldn't even see inside of it, despite how close it was.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And the size of this truck was amazing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It dwarfed the one we were in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As our driver accelerated, so did the truck
behind us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It might have run us off the
road if we had had to stay on it for very much longer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As we neared the entrance to the road we
looked back and the truck was just gone.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Now, I would have thought nothing of this if it weren't for the fact
that there were NO places that it could have turned off to between where I had
last looked at it and when it suddenly disappeared.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It just vanished.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Adrenaline pumping, we went back to my
friend's house in silence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>None of us
have spoken of he incident since then, but if I'm still freaked out about it
after ten years then I know they both still are.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I don't know how much this helps you in verifying your
information about the road.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor do I
even know if anybody will read this whole thing, after all, it has been rather
long winded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All I know is that I feel a
hell of a lot better finally telling this story to somebody who will hopefully
believe me and not roll their eyes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If
you're ever in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Lima</st1:City>, <st1:State w:st="on">OH</st1:State></st1:place>, look the bridge up, just don't linger
there too long.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For all I know, it could
have been our collective imaginations running wild.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The guy in the overalls could have been just
a local hick farmer trying to run trespassers off his land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The truck could have been him trying to make
sure we didn't come back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There could
have even been a side road or trail I failed to notice that he turned onto when
he saw that we were leaving.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The more I
think about it, though, the more vividly it all comes back to me, and I don't
think any of that was the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I
was there, I got a clear sense in the back of my mind that I was desecrating
something unholy just by being there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
believe that what I experienced that night was real.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">A story of the house I live in now.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I have always been hesitant to use the word &#8220;haunted&#8221; in
description of a place because of the negative connotations that have been
attached to the word.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It seems
especially wrong in this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our house
is cozy and pretty new.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is nothing
uncomfortable about it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No one feels
watched or scared or unnerved, which makes it a bit stranger even.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">We moved in at the beginning of September 2005.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nothing out of the ordinary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was several weeks before anything
happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">We were still in the unpacking/decorating phase.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have 3 roommates, Betty, Ann and
Shannon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only two of us were home at the
time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Betty and I were standing on the
stairs to the second floor, talking about what we could hang where when we
heard the door knob rattle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We thought
nothing of it because we were expecting Ann home from work at any minute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I guess it didn&#8217;t dawn on us that she had
never come in until several minutes later when we heard the locked knob rattle
again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You can see the front door from
the stairs and we looked down at it and I saw it being jiggled from the outside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Betty laughed and said, &#8220;She can&#8217;t get the
door unlocked.&#8221; So she went down to let Ann in.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She unlocked the door and swung it open for our other roommate to enter,
but all either of us saw was the empty street.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Huh. Weird, but we went back to what we were doing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sometime later I was sitting on the ottoman
in front of the TV (still within view of the front door).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Betty and I were still the only ones
home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It had been at least an hour since
the last knob rattle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It happened
again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I looked and watched it move.
(Betty was on the couch and could not see.)<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I said, &#8220;If Ann doesn&#8217;t walk through that door this time, I might
worry.&#8221;</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">She didn&#8217;t come home for another 45 minutes.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">We let this go, but not without wondering what was
outside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Several days later I was
sitting in the living room with a friend.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Suddenly there was a loud knocking that was distinctively on glass.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It came from the kitchen, so I got up to
check it out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once in the kitchen I
heard it again, it was on the kitchen window (the closest window to where we
had been from the front of our townhouse).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I looked and there was no one there.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I went over to the window and looked down, but nothing but our shrubs&#8230;
and a reminder that it was impossible for anyone to reach the window from
outside; it was far too high.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">We started to realize that something was outside and wanted
to come in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We tried to come up with
ways to keep it out, but when my cats started behaving strangely, I knew it was
too late.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I live in the basement by myself (all three of the others
are on the second floor) and I started to notice the cats watching something
that wasn&#8217;t there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Soon they seemed to
be petted and played with by someone I couldn&#8217;t see.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was hesitant to tell my roommates because,
although I didn&#8217;t feel threatened at all, I didn&#8217;t want to scare them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Soon however, TVs turning off and doors
opening and closing told them for me.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This kind of activity continued through the fall, but faded in winter
and now things seem quiet again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>About a
week ago, <st1:place w:st="on">Shannon</st1:place> was home alone and later
told us she had heard someone at the door&#8230; I wonder if this could go in cycles?</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Hi my name is Rachael and i have scary story for you lets
begin.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My friend lives right next to a haunted house i didn't
relize this until we had a sleepover. In the night we heard scary sound i asked
her what it was but she said she didn't know. We looked outside just as we
heard a scream coming from the house right next to us i was so scared but i
said to my friend that it was problaby just the wind but i knew it wasn't. but
just as i turned around i saw something black run into the haunted house i
turned back to my friend and said (ok im scared and you should be to!) we
looked out the window and saw the black figure in the house it was doing something
but i didn't know what BUT THEN THERE WAS A FLASH OF LIGHT IN THE HOUSE i ran
into my sleeping bag and freaked out. WHen i finally fell asleep i had a dream
about the ghost and it was the person that lived there and who died. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The next morning i woke up and went down for breakfeast and
went home but i swore that i would never go to her home for a sleepover again
that was for sure.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Experience</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: legsmc@yahoo.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Wanted to share my experience in the hopes of finding
someone who has had a similiar one.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">&gt;From 1996 to 2003, my family lived in a house in</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">central MS in a suburban area around a large lake and
river.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The entire time we lived in the
house, I always felt a presence there - especially in 2 rooms - the kitchen and
master bedroom.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">When alone in the house, I would often feel the presence of
someone and the room would get very cold. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">This was a fairly regular occurrence.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Occasionally, strange noises would wake my family in the
night - pots and pans banging, strange scraping noises in the hallway, bumps in
the living room - all when everyone was asleep.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">One night, my 5 year old daughter came to sleep with me in
the master bedroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She woke me up early
in the night saying there were two shadows standing beside the bed staring at
her and talking to each other - although she couldn't hear what they were
saying.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She said they looked like a man
and a woman, but she couldn't tell who they were.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I dismissed it and she left to sleep in her
own bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She wouldn't ever sleep with me
in that room again.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Several months after that (we had been in the house about 4
years at that point), I was awakened from a deep sleep by what felt like an
electrical shock starting at my foot and going all the way up through my
body.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I immediately sat up in bed
totally freaked out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was no one
there, but I felt a very strong presence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It took me a while to go back to sleep and I was so freaked that I
actually sat there and read the Bible aloud for a while until I felt I was
alone again.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">A few months later, the same thing happened again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was awaken in the middle of the night by an
electric shock.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, I sat up in bed
and looked around to find no one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again,
I read the Bible aloud for quite some time before I went back to sleep.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">After the second occurrence, I began "talking" to
the spirits whenever I felt a presence in the room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I felt stupid, but it made me feel better and
made the presence seem less intimidating to me.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I continued to do this until we moved in late 2003.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I never had another electric shock.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Until reading the haunted places on your site, I never knew
there were supposed hauntings at <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Greenfield</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Village</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>. It wasn't until
after visiting there and having a weird experience did I check the internet and
found out about it.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Anyway, it was the summer of 2005 and I'd gone there by
myself to see an Imax movie at Henry Ford museum.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Now I took my camera with me and that's another strange
story, but I wanted to get some cool pictures so i went from house to house in
the village. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Nothing unusual happened for a while and then I got to the
Noah Webster house.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The house itself isn't unusual. It's your typical 2 story
house that'd you'd expect someone in Webster's time period to live in. There
weren't any weird feelings or anything.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">So anyway a group of us were in the upstairs hall and
Webster's bedroom was locked from the public - we couldn't get in there. We
checked out the bedroom directly in front of his. Only minutes after getting
there, the doorknob to Websters bedroom started rattling and we heard this
weird moaning noise coming from the other side.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My first thought was "it's a spirit". Everyone
else pretty much ignored it, except this kid who looked through the keyhold of
the door. He didn't say anything, just kind of smiled like it was a joke.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I then went downstairs to let someone know to check out the
room, but the girl who worked there blew it off like it was a common thing.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">It stayed on my mind until coming home and then I checked
out internet and found out that house is supposed to be haunted by Webster's
angry ghost.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">As for my camera, I snapped pictures of the entire village
and as I was leaving found out that there wasn't any film in the camera. That's
never happened to me in 20 years of taking pictures. But it could just be a
mistake..!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Haunted Coal Mine</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I don't know if this qualifies as a ghost story, but here it
goes. A few years a go, I was visiting a friend in a small <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Virginia</st1:place></st1:State> town. He had took me up to an old
coal mine that had closed down years ago, due to a massive explosion at the
bottom of the shaft. While we were there, we heard a hellish scream. Please
excuse my language. The type of scream one would expect to hear from someone
who is slowly being tortured and killed. It rose through octave after octave.
Finally reaching a blood curdling point. Hung in the air for a few seconds and
finally stopped. Followed by what sounded like lunitical laughter. He finally
told me that twenty men perished there in the mine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I Believe that what we heard was a spirit
telling us to leave the area and leave their final resting place in piece. We
left the mine in a hurry, never to return to the mine again. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Hospital Haunts</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: GWS3466@aol.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I was talking to one of my friends I knew when I worked for
NIH in DC, and he reminded me of an old incident I try to forget.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I was really sick in 1999, I was transferred from Holy Cross
hospital to <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Georgetown</st1:City></st1:place>
hospital in DC. It's a old run down hospital but they had great doctors. Anyway
I was scheduled for a CAT scan, this particular day. Well, it was night when
they took me down for it. I think they do that because the Scanners are more
available. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Well the CAT scan was performed, and the Radiologist wheeled
me out to the waiting area, which at that time of night is dark and deserted.
So, I was sitting there waiting for him to finish what he was doing, so he
could call an escort to get me back to my room. Then, all the sudden a man in a
brown hospital gown ran past me down the hallway and around the bend. I yelled,
"HEY!", but the guy kept running. I had however, caught the attention
of the radiologist. He came out and said, "What's wrong?" I told him
about the guy running down the hallway in the hospital gown. The radiologist
told me that no one could get in this area this is a secured area. I assumed he
was wrong and someone slipped through. It was downtown DC. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">So he went back to finish his work and he told me it will be
a couple minutes he was having some equipment problems. So I waited, what else
could I do? I couldn't move. I was hooked up to all these tubes and poles and
everything. A minute later the same guy is running down the hallway the same
direction looking back in fear, at this time I could see he was a guy about in
his mid 30s. This sent a shiver down my spine, but I was drugged up and though
what ever. Then another couple minutes later, the guy ran by again in the same
direction, like it was a tape loop. He was looking back in fear again, but as
he past me, he looked right at me and I heard a sigh. The tingle in my spine
rose up out of my mouth, and I screamed like I never did before.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The Radiologist ran out and screamed "WHAT?". I
told him about the guy passing two more times and in the same direction. I told
him I didn't think it was a person as we know one. I'm a skeptic, besides
living in the city a ghost is the last thing you should worry about. The
radiologist didn't believe me I think, well I was on a morphine drip. So he
called the hospital escorts to pick me up. Then we heard a crash in the room
where they do the CAT scan. He went back to pick up the stuff and came out to
check on me. I told him "YOU SEE!!". He ignored me, then a second
later an IV pole dropped over behind us in the hallway. These poles were on a
wide four wheel base, it couldn't have fallen on its own. The Radiologist
finally agreed with me and we left that area. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The following evening that same radiologist called me and
said they have to do another Scan. There was a problem with the last one there
was a face like image overlaid on my scan. I went back down to do the scan but
I had family and friends with me. I told them I wouldn't do it alone. To this
day I don't care if I'm dying, I'm not going into that hospital again.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I Never Used to Believe in Ghosts</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: JUNE12KALAYAAN@aol.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I never really did believe in ghosts, or totally disbelieve
in them either when I was growing up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
guess I was somewhat "neutral" on the subject -- but as I began to
think back, there have been some unexplainable things that have happened to me
over the years that were kind of strange.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I didn't include all of them -- but here's a few:</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The Man on the Lawn:</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My parents moved to a new house when I was about 6 or 7
years old.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We had a nice pool in the
backyard, and some of our friends from the old neighborhood came over to
swim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was in the kitchen getting a
glass of water from the faucet in the sink, and I looked up to see a man just
standing right in our front yard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To me,
he looked just like the old guy who was a Mechanic and owned a gas station near
our old house called "Smith's Service" -- he had the same hallowed
cheeks, and was wearing a work uniform and a cap.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I turned and yelled out, "I just saw
Mr.Smith!" </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Everyone came upstairs into the kitchen to see what all the
fuss was about, but when I turned my head back the image was gone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My parents dismissed it as "overactive
imagination."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I seriously doubt
that it was the ghost of Mr. Smith (why would he be there of all places?!!) but
it certainly was somebody or something that looked somewhat like him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Regardless or who or what it was, I still can
remember seeing him standing there just as clear as day.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The Thing on the Railroad Tracks:</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Some years later when I was a teenager, I decided to take a
walk on the railroad tracks that were about a mile or so away from our
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The railway bridges were built in
the 1930's and had the year marked on them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was still winter, partly sunny but freezing cold.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As I was walking down one side of the double
set of tracks that passed near where the old train station was I saw something
up ahead.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My first impression was that
it was a black dog on the tracks walking a bit farther up front of me, kind of
hopping and trotting slightly sideways like dogs often do.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I stopped, not wanting to attract the dog's
attention (I was attacked by a dog not long after we moved into our new house,
and I still had somewhat of a fear of them for some years afterwards) </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">When I stopped, it stopped.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When I moved it moved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I then
just stood still and stared at it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
wasn't a dog, it was some kind of black shape -- not a mirage, or a heat
reflection, just an upright black shape.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The weird thing was that it appeared to be moving almost violently while
standing still, not going farther away or coming closer, but almost a weird
blur of motion in place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"This is
crazy -- there has to be some explanation...." </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I felt the tracks with my bare hands and they were ice
cold.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The ground was frozen solid, and
the sun was getting low and weak.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There
was no way it was a reflection of some kind.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I waited for long while not knowing what to do.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As I stood there it crossed over both sets of
tracks to the dirt path on the opposite side.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I just stood and stared for a long time at it trying to figure out what
it was.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had spent plenty of time
playing on these tracks over the years and had seen the shimmering mirages that
the heat could produce -- but this was something very different.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After a while I heard the sound of an
approaching train in the distance and stepped off the tracks, when the train
had finally passed the strange black figure was gone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The Haunted Mansion:</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">(Part I) Back in 1991 quite by accident I was reunited with
some college buddies who had rented a beautiful old house that had been a large
horse farm at one time (those in the Rochester Hills, MI area would recognize
it instantly!) but now the surrounding land was being developed into new
housing subdivisions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The place looked
just like an old Southern Plantation home, with magnificent pillars in the
front (we nicknamed it the "Mansion")<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Coincidentally, I was looking for a place to new place to live, and they
were looking for a 3rd roommate to share expenses - I moved in and had almost a
whole wing to call my own, with two bedrooms and a bathroom connecting them all
to myself!<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Not long after I had moved in, I was the only one home for
some reason -- it was a sunny afternoon and everyone was someplace else
enjoying the nice weather.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was lying
on my bed reading, when I heard a female voice as clear as a bell come from
downstairs in the kitchen calling, "Chris?" (just outside my bedroom
door was the top of a narrow servant's staircase that led right to the kitchen
-- but we mostly used the elaborate main staircase that was in the middle of
the wing that emptied out into the living room).</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My first thought was that it was the girlfriend of one of my
roommates (there were always people stopping by) so I figured I'd play a joke
on her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I leapt off the bed, and jumped
almost completely down the first long flight of stairs of the servant's
staircase while supporting my weight on the hand railing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I hit the with landing with both feet and
then sprang out into the kitchen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To my
utter amazement, there was no one standing there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">No problem, she's probably in the den I thought.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I walked through the kitchen, into the dining
room, through the living room and into the small den at the far end of the
ground floor where our TV set and one of the fireplaces was.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No one was there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As big as the house was, there was only one
way to go through it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I walked back
through the living room, into the dining room, and into the kitchen and looked
outside -- no cars were parked in the driveway, and the 2 dogs we had were fast
asleep under their tree in the front lawn (they barked at EVERYTHING that came
up to the house)!</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Puzzled, I looked outside in back near our garage and
nothing was there, either.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No car,
nobody.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I walked around the whole
downstairs again, and went upstairs using the main staircase, and back down on
the servant's staircase, calling out "Hello? Hello?".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After about 20 minutes of searching, I gave
up -- there was absolutely no one there!</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">(Part II) A few months later, I had come home from work and
was in my room again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was usually the
first one home (as my office was just about only a mile away) and the other two
roommates would straggle in sometime later.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I had been there long enough to recognize the "Creaks and
Groans" of the old house and could tell just where someone was standing in
the hallway or where they were coming up the stairs just by the way the
floorboards creaked. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Surprisingly, I heard someone coming up the main
staircase.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Whoever it was must
have pulled in the driveway almost right after I did"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I thought.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I could hear the creak of the footsteps at the bottom of the staircase,
the creak at the part in the middle landing, again at the top (at this point if
someone turns and goes towards the West Wing, there is another set of creaks as
they walk up the smaller stairs to the right, if they turn left and come down
my hallway there is a major creaky board that everybody hits on the other side
of the wall right next to where my bed is) </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The footsteps went towards the right, and the creaking of
the smaller stairs was just as expected -- it was obviously my roommate that
lived in the West Wing, home very early for some reason.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unexpectedly, I heard the radio in his room
suddenly blare out loud -- like you'd hear if you were trying to change the
station, but accidentally turned the volume knob up all the way instead!)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The sound lasted just a second, and went
quiet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I expected to hear a string of
loud swear words follow, but instead I heard the footsteps proceed again
farther down the hallway towards the room at the very end where we had a bar
with a fish tank, a drum set, and a few electric guitars.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In just about the time that you'd expect it
to take someone to walk there, I heard a soft but very distinct "Ting!"
as if someone had flicked one of the cymbals on the drumset with their finger
nail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I walked out of my room into my hallway, across the main
staircase landing, and into the other wing calling my roommate's name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No answer.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Yeah, that's real funny, dude"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I stuck my head into the first room -- empty.
I walked to the room on the end.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No one
at all!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was no way out of the end
room except past where I had just come from!<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I felt the chills go down my spine -- this was way too creepy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I think I left the house, if I recall correctly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I came back the either later that night or
the next day (more likely I think) when everyone was home -- and told my
story.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The one roommate that lived in
the West Wing had his share of "ghost stories" to tell as well,
apparently he'd had some strange experiences, too.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A couple of months later, during a huge
Thanksgiving dinner with everybody's relatives over we decided to tell a few of
the stories.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Apparently, somebody's Aunt
and Uncle that were there overheard, and went upstairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When they came down, they said, "Yep,
she's in there"</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">We looked at each other, "Who ?" They replied,
"The old woman in the room with the gold wallpaper" The funny thing
was that when I told the story I never mentioned which room it was -- but they
sure picked the right one!</p>

Ghost Story:</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Just last year I was in the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region> visiting my girlfriend
whom I've known for a few years now.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
has an apartment that she shares with her sister-in-law that is fairly small,
with two bedrooms upstairs, and a small living room, kitchen and bathroom
downstairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My girlfriend was asleep in
her room, and I was watching their small TV in living room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I heard her call for me from the kitchen
saying, "Hon? Hon?" and I answered, "What?"<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">No reply.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So I asked
again, "What, Hon?"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Still no
reply.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I got up and went into the
kitchen -- and no one was there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
looked in the small bathroom and it was empty.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was her voice -- plain as day!<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I went upstairs and she was still asleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I sat down on the bed, she woke up and I
asked her if she had wanted anything.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She said "No" and asked why.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I told her that I heard her in the kitchen calling my name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Her reply floored me -- she no, she had been upstairs
asleep, but there was a "small creature" in the apartment that could
imitate other people's voices and sometimes would call out the name of whoever
was home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her sister-in-law and cousin
both agreed, they'd heard the creature as well, they'd often thought one of
them was calling their name when they were in another room, but neither one had
said anything.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The voices always came
from the same part of the kitchen near the bathroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Sorry this was so long, but I wanted to share these strange
experiences!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">When I was 9 I used to live in a very big house. The master
bedroom had french doors. At night we would leave the windows open to keep the
house nice and cool becasue we didn't have air conditioning. I woke up at 21:30
to go use the facilities and there was a big gust of wind blowing the french
doors open but there was no hangers on the door. So I just opened the bathroom
door, went inside, and closed the door to go to the bathroom. When I was done I
went to check and see if my brother was sleeping (He stayed in the master
bedroom) the doors had two hangers on them and my brother was still at work. I
went in the room to see if my little sister was playing a trick on me but all I
saw was a shadowy figure and heard moaning noises. I ran into my parents room
and told them what I saw but of course they didn't believe me.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">My name is John. I have a ghost story to tell. When<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was 10 or 11 two friends and I lived<span style="">&nbsp; </span>in a village called<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lingfield in Surrey <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">England</st1:country-region></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One late Saturday afternoon on gloriously
sunny late summer&#8217;s day my friends and I, looking for a bit of excitement to
relieve the boredom of a long school holiday, decided to explore the old church
yard . The medieval parish church was<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>typical of the period: Old, dank, gloomy and atmospherically creepy. The
church yard was just across the road from the church, it was an old church
yard, old gravestones cluttered the unkempt cemetery, moss and ivy grew<span style="">&nbsp; </span>over the much neglected gravestones the
lettering worn with age, naming people long forgotten. Weeds and tall uncut
grass provided a gloomy retreat in the cool of the late afternoon shade. We had
not been particularly looking for ghost as you might be thinking but the
setting did bring such thoughts to mind. Looking around tense at every sound we
saw the crypt door ajar, a chink of dark penetrating gloom. With some
trepidation we ventured down the steep steps into the damp and musty
vault.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pushing open the door<span style="">&nbsp; </span>we nervously stepped inside. A coffin lay
upturned on the floor, as our eyes become accustomed to the gloom we saw<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the remains of a skeleton laying partly on
the floor, long since disturbed from its resting place. Two passages led of in
different directions, we peered into the dark seeing nothing down the pitch
black passages which led to who knows where. Before we could think about
further exploration we felt chill, penetrating, icy cold. We heard a strange
moaning noise emanating from one of the passages. A white figure emerged the
apparition of an elderly lady with long a flowing gown and trailing<span style="">&nbsp; </span>thin white hair. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Unlike stereotypical ghosts of popular fiction and myth the
apparition seemed substantial yet floated a few inches above the ground. She
glided towards my friends and I her arms outstretched as though to embrace us.
I am not a timid person and felt no fear. My friends however were more
apprehensive, indeed panic stricken. We all fled out in more haste than we
entered racing breathlessly up the stairs and out of the door without looking
back relieved to once again be outside in the sunlight. Many people do not
really believe me thinking perhaps that this was a childhood fantasy or was a
false memory obscured and embellished by the passing of time. But be assured
this account is true, the experience was no figment of my imagination and the
incident remains fresh in my mind as clear as the day it happened nearly fifty
years ago. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My mother who has had many experience herself said that the
lady was just being friendly. My mother like me seemed to take this incident
all in her stride as though it was an everyday occurrence - who knows perhaps
it was for many other people have seen the ghost of this lady. Who she was
sadly I do not know. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I have a ghost in my bedroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>it's a little girl with an old fashioned
victorian age dress.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She has a blue hat,
and is transparent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since I met her,
weird things have been happening.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">First of all, i met her when i was seven.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I didn't tell my parents about this
experience.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That day, my friends came
over to play.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But we all had an
interesting thing to share.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All of us
had some kind of toy that we were missing.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And in place, we all had these weird lego bushes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The exact same ones.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I've never figured out what that was
about.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A couple days later, the little
girl (who was my age at that time) actually brought a camera with her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For all the times I've met her, she never
speaks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No sound is ever made,
either.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She motioned for me to take a
photo of the both of us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was simple
enough that i could work it, so i did.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Then, she waved goodbye.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Unfortunately, the photo disappeared.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have no physical proof that it ever
happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The little girl didn't show up
for another three years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I was ten,
she came back, same age and appearence as before.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I asked her where she went, but she didn't
react at all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She just smiled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whenever I'm with her, I feel at ease and
happy, not frightened at all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I tried
telling my dad, and he's totally skeptical, so of course he didn't believe
me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But my mom...it turns out that she
has had her own ghostly experience.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">When my mom was six, she went to a party just a couple weeks
after her grandmother's death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was
really sad and upset that she wasn't having fun like everyone else.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She went to the bathroom for a little bit and
was washing her hands, when she saw a lady behind her in the mirror.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She turned around, not at all frightened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was a woman with a black coat and a big
black purse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She smiled warmly and
offered candy to my mom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But my mom said
no, because she had always been taught to never take candy from strangers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The woman gave her candy anyway, and my mom
thanked her and went back to the party, suddenly feeling happier.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Later, she went to talk to her aunt to tell her about the
woman in the bathroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her aunt freaked
out when she described the woman and her big black purse with candy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My mom's grandma looked just like that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Through my mother's side of the family there has been quite
a few instances which you may call psychic. For example my grandmother
predicted a car crash and my mother had a strange feeling that her friend's
grandmother would die, a month later she did. When I was about three I was over
at a friend of my parents' house. I was playing outside and saw a man hanging
in a tree in their backyard, i told my mum and she listened, obviously thinking
it was my overactive imagination and joked about it to her friends. strangely
though, they seemed a bit freaked out and told her that the previous owner had
committed suicide by hanging himself in one of the trees in the garden.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">i used to live in a terrace when i was about 3 or 4. it was
two stories high and used to be one house, although they removed the stairs in
the hallway so that they could rent it to two different families. some nights i
would get out of bed so i could sleep in my parents bed (hey, i was only
little) but one night i found myself walking the wrong way and looking up, i
saw a staircase. i don't know if there is such thing as a ghost staircase, but
it is one of the most vivid memories i have. it couldn't have been a dream,
because i woke up in my parents' bed the next morning.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My sister and i used to sleep in the same room. one night i
heard footsteps coming down the hallway and into our room. i couldn't see what
or who it was, but somehow i could tell that it was standing just above my
sister's bed. My sister screamed and ran out, but i just assumed it was my dad coming
to check on us. the next morning i realised that the footsteps sounded as if
the person was wearing shoes, we never wear shoes in our house, especially in
the middle of the night. my dad heard the footsteps too, but my sister didn't
remember screaming and running from her bed. We live next to a cemetery and i
haven't heard anything since.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I was at my cousin Whitney's dad's house. I was staying the
week with them. The week was great and i was having lots of fun. Until Wensday
i was walking down to the basement and the lights where off except for the
faint glow of the computer. I was reaching for the light when i saw a black cat
with a collar around it's neck. I had been told they got a new cat, and since i
hadnt seen it yet i assumed that was the cat. I looked at the cat then my step
cousin maddy came down stairs and told me we where about to go boating and to
get ready. I told her what i saw and her eyes got real wide. She then told me
that they "used" to have a black cat but it had died because her dad
had left anti freeze out and the cat had drank it. She then told me that their
new cat was upstairs in the living room playing with the baby.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">My Haunted House</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: LAURAESCOT@aol.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My name is Laura, im nineteen years old and iv lived in the
same house in the north east of <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">England</st1:country-region></st1:place>
all my life. Its a normal, three bedroom semi, in the suburbs of a a fairly
large city near the sea. The houses were built during the second world war and
only one other couple have lived their before my parents bought it thirty years
ago. Anyway, we have had many spooky experiences in this house, so many I will
probably miss loads of them out. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">First of all, when my parents first moved in, my aunty, who
was only a teenager at the time, would often stay over at weekends. However,
she hated staying in the house on her own and would often open all the doors
and windows in case she needed to escape quickly, after a while she refused to
stay in the house because of the odd feelings she had when she was in it. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">In my parents room there used to be a pull light with a long
piece of string hanging from the ceiling. On many of occasions my parents would
wake up to see the string swinging so much that it would actually hit off the
ceiling! </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The strangest thing about my house is the ticking noise. It
can be heard in every room upstairs. In my room (which I share with my younger
sister) it comes from under my sisters bed, in my mum's room it comes from her
wardrobe, and in my sisters room it comes from inside her wardrobe. It doesn&#8217;t
happen every night but sometimes it is really loud, others you have to strain
to hear it. Also, sometimes it is very fast and other times slow. But the
strange thing about it is if we tell it to be quiet it will stop. Normally, the
sound id accompanied by a strong smell of tobacco smoke. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I recently decorated my bedroom and moved my bed into the
corner of the room. Since then a lot of weird things have started happening and
it all comes from under my bed. First of all, I could hear a whispering sound
coming from under the pillow whenever I put my head down on it. Then one night
I had left a plastic carrier bag next to my bed, just as I was starting to go
to sleep it started to make a noise as if someone was moving it. I ignored it
for a few mins but it carried on and got louder. I assumed one of my cats had
gotten into my room and was playing with the bag but when I moved it there was
nothing to b found. I lay back down but again, just as I was starting to sleep,
it began to move, this time even more than before. On many occasions my bed as
actually moved while iv been lying in it, it has been lifted up as if someone
is pushing it from underneath. I told my mam about what had been happening and
she decided to spend a night in my bed to see if it was true or just my
imagination and sure enough, she could not sleep for all the noises and
movements from under my bed. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My brother has now left home but when he was younger he used
to deliver papers early on a Sunday morning. One day he got up and was getting
ready down stairs. Everyone else in house was in bed asleep but he heard a mans
voice loud and clear telling him to be quiet. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My younger sister on two occasions has heard heavy breathing
right in her ear. And just last week my mum was sitting in the living room when
she heard a man whisper her name twice, yet she was alone in the house. At the
time, all three of our cats were in the room and they all looked spooked as
well. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">On two occasions people have actually seen a ghost in my
house. One morning my brother was sitting putting his shoes on in the living
room. In our house the sofa is against a wall next to door leading to the
hallway. Our TV is directly opposite the sofa. Because my brother was going
out, he had switched off the tele. Once he had finished putting on his shoes he
looked up and in the reflection of the TV screen he could see a tall man
standing in the doorway. He was wearing a long dark coat and a hat, as my
brother turner round he saw the man walk into the hallway. He followed the man
up stairs and he vanished into my room. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Another time, my mum was sitting in the dining room when she
felt something behind her, she looked round and there was a white figure in the
doorway, it stayed for a few seconds then vanished. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">One night, my brother and his girlfriend were in our living
room, they were the only two in the house. They were changing the batteries on
the back of the TV remote and had removed the cover and placed it on the coffee
table. when they came to put it back on it was no longer on the table. They
searched the room but it wasn&#8217;t anywhere. They later went into the kitchen (the
door to the kitchen had been shut the whole time) and the cover was on the
kitchen floor. On the same night they were sitting watching TV when they heard
a knocking coming from the wall behind them, the wall divides the living room
and hallway and there was nothing in the hallway when they checked. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">So that&#8217;s a few of the strange things that have happened in
my house, I hope you have enjoyed reading it</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Have You Heard Similiar Stories?</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: ComaroCOMARO68@aol.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I wanted to share an experience that I had, I dont know what
it mean's exactly, but I came to my own inclussion of why the event happened.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I'm guessing my experience had to do with a car accident
that involved several teen's driving drunk after they had just left <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Sunset</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Beach</st1:PlaceType>
in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Tarpon Springs</st1:City>, <st1:State w:st="on">Florida</st1:State></st1:place>. They had left the beach
intoxicated, found themselves eventually driving on Alt. 19, also known as <st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">Pinellas Ave.</st1:address></st1:Street> when
they struck another vehicle of a family ( I think it was a family of 4). To my
understanding every one in both vehicles was killed, except for one girl. The
surviving girl however, lost her sister in that accident. My own sister was
friends with the girls in school, not real close, but friends. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Well approxiamately
one year after the accident, I'm guessing, which was about 16 years ago,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was looking for something to do. I think it
was late spring or early summer. I had my two young children with me about 2 and
3 years old at that time. I also had one of my sisters with me, which was about
16 or 17 years old.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>It was overcast that
day, but I kept hoping the sun would come out, I wanted to go to the beach. The
sun kept peeking in and out so I decided to chance it. I chose to head out to <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Sunset</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Beach</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>
with my children and sister. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I liked <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Sunset</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Beach</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> because it was
nice, quiet, and not crowded like the Fred Howard Beach which was only 5
minutes down the street. <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Sunset</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Beach</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> was a place that
young teens liked to hang out and drink in the late afternoons. I know, because
I used to hang out there too when I was a teen.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Well, as we started to approach the short stretch of
causeway, at that very moment it started to sprinkle, I remember feeling so
bummed out. I continued to drive down that short causeway, which had rocks
lined on both sides. As I continued on, I could not believe what I saw, Black
cats were everywhere. There must have been two-three hundred of them, the most
scary looking black cats with,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I think
green or orange eyes. I dont remember which it was, there eyes were almost
glowing, no joking. They were walking on the rocks, along the beach water,
which I could hardly believe (dont cats hate the water?) And, they all seemed
to be heading towards the picnic table which I used to hang out at with my teen
friends.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>I remember they
starred at us as we drove by. I couldn't take my eyes off of them. I knew this
wasn't right. I thought even if this was some kind of joke, where and how could
any one find so many Black cats at any one moment. And, how would they get them
there?</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">And, as I remember not one single soul was there at the
Beach, that is unusual even for an overcast day. As, I circled around to leave
the beach, I had to look again. I was shaking my head in disbelief that I could
have really seen that. Me and my sister never looked at each other once, all I
remember saying to her was " do you see that, she answered yea. We were
absolutely speachless at that moment. I wished that I had gotten out of the car
or something, I dont know why I feel that way, maybe to have found an answer to
why. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The whole way home I thought about what we had just seen, I
started thinking about my other sisters friends that were in that accident. So,
I called her as soon as I got home and asked her about how long ago that
happened, had it been quite a year. She answered yes, I think so, about that. I
started thinking maybe it was the teen's year anniversary since they died.
Maybe, they were still there at the beach in their own minds, not realizing
they are not really amongst the living. I dont know, but, I wonder what it all
means. I wonder if any one else saw what I saw that day.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I grew up in a very small town called <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Hebbronville</st1:City>, <st1:State w:st="on">TX</st1:State></st1:place>.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I went to pre-school called 'Little Flower School'
there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Right next to the school was an
old white 3 story building which was always locked up and a fence built around
it to keep us children away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our
playground area is directly in front of this building.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I remember everyday during recess as I played I would always
see a lady at a window(which at the time I didn't know was a Nun), and I was
always trying to get her attention.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Sometimes I succeeded and got a smile and a wave, other times I would
get a cold quiet stare from her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You see
as children we were never allowed to go into the building.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But to me I thought she was a teacher and I
was always trying to ask permission to go inside with her and be the first kid
to see the inside of that building.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I have memories of her sweeping and even lighting an oil
lamp for light.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The one memory that
scares me the most was when I actually got permission from her to go upstairs
where she was.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I yelled out to her and
said if I could help her with anything.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She nodded and beckoned me to come up to where she was.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was so excited and I ran through the gate
up to the doors and yanked it open.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
went inside and looked around for stairs.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As I was making my way through the room to the stairway I could hear my
school teachers running across the playground screaming for me to get out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was stepping over old chalk boards and
overturned childrens desks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The place
was completely gray with dust.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As I was
walking up the stairway something was telling me to stop.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I froze in terror.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My teacher reached the entrance and looked up
at me and yelled at me to get out now.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
was so scared to move and I noticed she didn't want to come in to get me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally I managed to walk back to her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She started asking me why I went inside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I told her I had gotten permission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She said from who.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I said from the teacher upstairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She looked confused and said what teacher,
show me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I stood outside and pointed up
to the window but nobody was there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
asked me how I opened the door if it was bolted shut.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I couldn't explain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I just said it opened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Every teacher wanted to hear my story.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I repeated it about a thousand times.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I thought I was in trouble for sure and wasn't surprised when
they took my father aside after school when he came to pick me up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I didn't get a scolding that day or ever about that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Only later did I find out from my father that the old
building was once a school with Nuns as teachers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And that the lady I would see and call to
everyday wasn't just any lady.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was a
ghost.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">My daughter had many confrontations with numerous ghosts in
this house. One night she woke from her sleep to see a soldier in her closet
glaring at her with a slight glow on him.She saw him slowly move<span style="">&nbsp; </span>in her direction. She noticed his boots were
off the floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My girl screamed her way
to my room. Other hauntings were the clear sound of some ones foot steps going
up the stairway, down the hall to the front bedroom, there, they would stop. My
teenage daughters would lose jewelry, nail polish and pretty hair accessories.
When I was cleaning in a room we did'nt use, I found a loose floor board and
pried it up. Under- neath</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I found not only some of their missing things, but I found
child's ball (which was hard like concrete)<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>; an old letter dated 1909-reporting the child's progress at school;
some old photos of a man;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>an old tin
can; and a spelling test. Voices were heard calling two of<span style="">&nbsp; </span>my daughters' names .My ex husbands father
died in that house on his own daughters birthday.She said he had gone
upstairs<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>that morning to sing happy
birthday to her. He stopped just outside of the front bedroom door. As for the
soldier,my ex-husbands brother had been in the military , he was killed in a
terrible car accident one year prior to his father's death. And the room my
younger daughter had<span style="">&nbsp; </span>was his when he
lived at home. Also, in the beginning of the 1900's the house was owned by a
podiatrist whose wife was very ill.My daughters heard old muffled music. On a
cold rainy day we were in the dining room doing homework, when the kitchen door
opened up and slowly started to shut . The lights of the chandelier blew up on
more then one occasion.My youngest daughter would reach to turn on or off a
light and the switch would spark. The micro wave oven blew up Many more things
happened here and around the entire neighborhood. At first I didn't see or hear
the things my girls and my ex were<span style="">&nbsp; </span>,but,
it didn't take long after the footsteps came DOWN the steps ....when my
girls<span style="">&nbsp; </span>were all gone for the night. Also,
there was an awful odor in the house that I could not get rid of.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Great site you have, I have been reading it for several
years. I thought I would contribute one of my experiences.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My family and I were living in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Sioux Falls</st1:City>, <st1:State w:st="on">SD</st1:State></st1:place>
in 2002-2004 in a trailer. It started out of the blue. I would see a dark fog
like apparition coming out of my wife&#8217;s closet regardless of whether the lights
were on or not. I didn&#8217;t tell my wife about this due to the fact she is scared
easily and I was usually at work until 2 am. More and more we began to hear
footsteps but I attributed it to the trailer settling. After a while I asked my
wife if she had noticed anything out of the ordinary. She said she had and
described the black fog that would be in our room from time to time. A few
weeks later I was returning from the main bathroom when I looked into the
bedroom and noticed a full size black specter, just a littler taller than
myself. After staring at it for a few seconds it moved itself to the right and
was no longer in my view. A little panicked I went to my computer to listen to
some music and play counter-strike. As time went on things would randomly go
missing, but only my things such as medicine bottles and my right shoe would
disappear for days at a time. My wife and I have a mutual friend that has
National Guard Drill once a month and she was staying with us that night and
noticed the black fog once again; things started getting stranger with doors
opening and closing and odd chills. One night I heard my two daughters talking
to someone in there room. Later I asked who they were talking to. My oldest
daughter Caitlin replied &#8220;It&#8217;s our baby brother&#8221; (this term was for pretty much
any male child younger than their ages of 4 and 3) I asked my daughters what he
looked like. Samantha, my youngest replied &#8220;He has brown hair and white eyes&#8221; A
thought popped into my head at that moment. My middle sister Stacy was
pregnant; perhaps it is the spirit of her unborn child. . After that we just
realized we had a ghost and we would speak to it if we didn&#8217;t like it doing
something, say hi etc. and after a while the incidents stopped. As it turns out
about 3 months later she gave birth to a healthy baby boy, brown hair included</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Shortly after my parents, my sister and I moved to <st1:State w:st="on">Arkansas</st1:State> from <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Washington</st1:place></st1:State>,
my father's youngest brother was killed in a gunshot accident. That summer my
father's family had a family reunion. This was an event that lasted over a
week. At one point during the week, my cousin and I had had enough of all of
the people and the pool. We were sitting in the living room watching the
television when we heard the organ in the back room playing. No one else had
come in the house while we were in there. So, we walked to the back of the
house to see who it was. First of all, the only two people in the family that
knew how to play the organ in the back room were my grandmother (whom we could
clearly hear out on the patio) and my recently deceased uncle. When we got to
the door of the room, the playing stopped. We went in the room and the organ
was infact on. We checked the closet, under the bed, behind the curtains and
the lock on the window. There was no one in the room and the window was locked.
We turned off the organ and walked out of the room. Before we got down the hall
to the living room, the organ started playing again. We decided that it was our
uncle and just sat in the living room and listened to it in the background as
we watched T.V.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">This happened over 10 years ago but I remember it like
yesterday! I was visiting my mom's village and my grandparents owned a tin
calbin there with a blackish tree beside. Anway one day I was in there at night
time playing with my doll when I heard a girl crying. Then the lights went out,
and I saw a girl who looked really pretty! Then I saw this black horse beside her,
then the horse came close to me and I was about to touch it when my mom open
the door in a hurry and then the girl was gone. When I told my mom what
happened she told me to describe "the girl" and I did, then my mom
got this werid look on her like she was scared, but she just told me to stop
copying my great grandfather's story! Which to me made no sense until I heard
the story from my cousin!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>:</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">One day when my g. grandfather was coming from his job as a
security guard (it was 1 am) he heard crying, when he followed it, it led him
to the Blackish tree (beside the tin calbin) , he saw a pretty girl with a
black horse on top of the tree! He assked if she needed help and she wanted to
get down, and as a kind man he offered to help, just before he touched her hand
the sun began to come up and when he looked back at her she was gone! Then 2
days later his 2nd daughter died!</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">So first I think she was just kidding cause she may have
heard about me but then (if I remembered correctly) I never told my mom about
the black horse so how can she know about it? Then after 2 days my grandma
dies. But the werid thing is that I saw her again but this time she had red
eyes and blood all around her! This happened a year ago, and I even can still
her how she moaned and now it just scares me! Good thing my mom belived me this
time (But I think she belived me a long time ago) cause she told my grandpa to
cut down the tree and today the "tin calbin" is now my calbin
whenever I visit here and the good thing is that the girl never came back!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But when I told my friend she said that she
also saw her and calls her a banshee cause banshees' only appear when someone
dies and after that my friend had a car accident and was pronouced dead on the
spot! I will always wonder if it was a banshee or was it just a ghost....</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I was there with my rainbow group in 2001, we stayed on the
3rd floor, the 4th and 5th floors were being renovated at the time. We stayed
at the end of the hall., which was told to be the hall they shot the film the
shining, but who knows right,. Well the room was old, the windows had no locks.
I remember it like it was yesterday, there was a staircase right behind our
room, and at night we would here footsteps above on the ceiling, coming from
the 4th floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Which was being redone so
noone should be up there especially at about 12, or 1 in the mornign and then
the second night we were there, I was laying in bed, and smething banged on the
wall right next to my head, and I fell of out bed. We looked out in the
staricase and nothing was there, no door closing or nothing, so we went back
into the room and about 15mins later it happened again,. That was just the
first encounter. Sometimes when we first got there, we would put our stuff in
the closet and when we cmae back the stuff was moved and the closet door was
open. And then we got so scared after the second night we stayed in our
advisors room, but stuff kept on happening, the 4th night, it rained and we can
see across to our rooms, from our advisors room, and when it lighting and lit
up the sky, we saw a persons face on the 4th floor above our room, and then
later that night, we had the fan off, and it just started moving, and then
would stop out of nowhere. The next day we left.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Just wanted to share my story with you. It
was interesting, scray but interesting</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I spent half of my childhood and a good many years of my
adulthood in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Cape Girardeau</st1:place></st1:City>.
The old hospital on Morgan Oak is one of the spookiest places I've ever been,
and I worked at the Winchester Mystery House. First of all, the name of the
hospital was the old <st1:place w:st="on"><st2:Sn w:st="on">St.</st2:Sn> <st2:middlename w:st="on">Francis</st2:middlename> <st2:Sn w:st="on">Hospital</st2:Sn></st1:place>.
I went in there back in 2000,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>before
they tore it down, and I went in there with an old girlfriend. We found a
pentagram engraved in the basement floor, dark stains on the floor, which we
could only guess at. We heard footsteps, things falling to the floor making
loud metallic noises, cold spots where my long hair would stand on end, and I
even felt my hair being pulled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only
spookier place I ever went in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Cape
  Girardeau</st1:place></st1:City> was an old hotel that had been closed for
years (I think the name was the Marimont Hotel). </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I went in there with the same ex-girlfriend, and heard
footsteps, cold spots, moaning, real hot spots, things thrown against walls and
just a general feeling of being watched and followed. We went to every floor,
including the basement, and there was no sign of life at all. We even had to
climb in from the neighboring building rooftop, walking along a catwalk and
slip in through a broken window. The basement was the worst feeling, especially
in the boiler room. I felt a pure evil presence down there and had to leave the
building. My girlfriend convinced me to stay a little longer, since we hadn't
gone to the roof yet. We made our way to the roof (difficult since the top 2 or
3 floors were heavily damaged due to a fire), and the entire time, I felt as if
we were being followed. When we got to the roof, something began pelting us with
pebbles that were found on the roof floor. We got out of the building as soon
as possible, and when we were across the street, more pebbles began hitting us
even harder that before, in fact denting a metal sliding door. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The following day, we went back into the hotel, and went
immediately to the roof. I picked up a handful of pebbles, and threw them at
the metal door across the street. Not a single one hit the door, and I have a
pretty good arm on me. Other world strength? I don't know, but the experience
scared the hell out of me. Just thought you'd like to hear this.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">My name is Margaret and about a year ago I lived in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Columbia</st1:City>, <st1:State w:st="on">SC.</st1:State></st1:place>
My husband was then stationed at the military base <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Ft.</st1:PlaceType> <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Jackson</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>
and we lived off base about 15 minutes away. Toward the end of his term, he was
on duty for 2 weeks and had to sleep in the barracks on base, so every night at
6:00 I would leave the house to stay with him. I have two dogs and before I
left my routine was to lock them in the kitchen with a baby gate and then I
would put my dogs favorite toy in there with them. After I stayed on base with
my husband I would arrive back home at 9:00 in the morning and on the second
morning I found the dog toy that I had put in the kitchen in the hallway. This
was a position that no person could even throw it to. Well, to say the least I
thought that I had just forgotten to put in the kitchen. So that night I made
sure that the toy went with my dog and then left the house. The next morning I
found it in the same place in the hallway. I thought I was going crazy so I
never mentioned it to my husband. For the next few nights it kept happening and
the last time I found it I called my husband at work. I told him the whole
story and how weird it was and how also I've seen dark spots in the hallway out
of the corner of my eye the whole time we've lived there. He said there is no
such thing as ghosts and I was probably playing tricks on myself. We kept
arguing and I told him there was a ghost in this house, I wasn't afraid but I
was right. After I spoke about it out loud in the house it stopped, until a few
weeks later when a some things were moved around. I have witnesses for that,
because before we left my friends and I moved a laptop to a secure spot so it
wouldn't fall and when we came back it was on the top of the couch. There are
things that we don't understand in this world and I've experienced the
evidence.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">My friend and I Jeffrey were walking through the local park
when the swing next to us started to move rapidly by its self. I had noticed it
then I told Jeffrey. We had to run out of the park. I stopped and turned around
and the swings had stopped but I saw a strange figure on the horizon and it
looked like if it was watching us. We were realy freaked by this so we kept on
running. I was staying at Jeffrey&#8217;s house that night, neither of us could get
to sleep,the figure of the man was still was still my head. We tried to use
different roots avoiding even seeing the park. On Friday 26 of April we decided
to give it a shot and go through the park strangely the swingshad been taken
down but it wasn&#8217;t the swings I was worried about it was the figure. We were
half way through the park when I looked up to see the figure again, my heart
was pounding. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Strangely Jeffery had just collapsed to the ground. I was
really scared and bent down to see if he was ok. When I looked back up the
figure had disappeared. He finally had got up and we couldn&#8217;t belive what had
happened and couldn&#8217;t wait to tell everybody about this mysterious event. We
never went back to the park and our story stays true.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I moved in with a friend in a house in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Moreno</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Valley</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>,
Ca it was an older ranch property with 3 houses and a barn on 2 acres. The
house was the main house on the property.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was a long style ranch house. When you entered into the front door it
was into a large long front room that went into the dining room. The main
bedroom door came directly off the living room the bathroom was right next to
the bedroom both doors were just before the dining room. The kitchen had an
open doorway that was at the end of the dining room behind the kitchen was a
small area that originally was on office area behind that came the second
bedroom. Standing in the front door you could see all the way to the second
bedroom. The rooms were long and large. I moved in with a friend who moved out
a month after I moved in. I rented the second room to my sister in laws mother.
The first time I experienced anything I was alone in the house. I was asleep.
When I woke up it was about 2 in the morning <span style="">&nbsp;</span>I heard steps on the wooden floor they were
walking towards my bed I could not see anyone even though the neighbors
security light lit my room up annoyingly bright. The steps continued towards my
bed. Stopped at the end of my bed and then it seemed as though someone had sat
on the end of my water bed the water moved me as if someone had actually sat. I
then heard a loud sighing sound as if someone was very exhausted. This kept me
up until my phone rang with a friend asking me to come help him with a load of
hay I threw my jeans and shirt on in bed and tore out of the house. Two days
later the spoons started. When ever I walked through the kitchen the washed
spoons would fly across the kitchen as if someone had hit the tip of the face
up spoon sending it across the kitchen. My roommate asked me if I had a problem
with clean spoons. I replied I wasn&#8217;t talking about the spoons and if she left
them on the floor that was fine with me. I never touched another spoon the
whole time I lived in that house. The spoons did this regardless of anyone
being in the house or not. The next thing that happened I was alone in the
house it was early evening when it started. A few days earlier my niece was
visiting her grandma they were in her room that was at the other end of the
house with the door shut they were playing as every few minutes my niece would
run out giggling and laughing that grandma was going to tickle her. A few nights
after my niece went home I was alone in the house when I started to hear feet
running on the wooden floor in a voice similar to my niece who was at home in
Anaheim the voice started saying the part of the conversation between my niece
and her grandmother that they had in the shut room. &#8220;Grandmas going to get you
better run. Laughter and giggling&#8221; There was no way I could have heard this
part of the conversation as it was at the other end of the house behind a
closed door. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>I tore out of the house and
went to my moms. A week after my roommate moved out leaving me and my 2 year
old son in the house. Less than a week later I was in the bath tub when it
became ice cold the mirror became clear of all steam. And the feeling was
terrifying by this time I had put a chord long enough to go into every room in
the house on my phone, I called a friend told him I had enough and to come and
get me. He did and we moved me lock stock and barrel out of that house one
other time I lived in a newly built apartment it was built (Unknown to me at
the time) on Indian burial grounds. The things that went on became so
terrifying that I carried and slept with my bible at all times before I moved
out of there. The second time the instant I felt that terrifying feeling I was
out of there. .<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Two years later I was speaking
to a friend about haunted houses, she told me about a house her sister lived
next door to for about twelve years before they had torn it down for some track
houses. She told me that after the power and water boxes had been removed the
lights and sprinklers would come on and she could see someone through the
window dancing and moving... The house was empty for several years and but
there was always a feeling of someone being there. As well as lights being on
and water running I soon realized that we were speaking of the same house that
I had these things happen to me in. <o:p></o:p></p>
