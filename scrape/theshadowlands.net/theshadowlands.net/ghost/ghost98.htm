<P><B>Hi, I love your site! The amount of content here is amazing, I will
be weeks in reading through</B>
<P><B>it all, I'm sure. I have a story of a minor occurence, but still strange
and unexplained. It was</B>
<P><B>told to me by my mother over the phone this past week (while she was
still at the house in </B>
<P><B>question) and is verified by my father and grandmother. </B>
<P>
<P><B>It happened less than one week ago, around the 27th of July, 1999.
My elderly great uncle Frank </B>
<P><B>owns a large parcel of mountain land and a ranch house in Colorado.
Nobody has lived there for </B>
<P><B>about 6 months, since Frank now needs to be taken care of by my grandmother
who lives in another</B>
<P><B>state. This summer however, my mother, father, and grandmother accompanied
him back up to his </B>
<P><B>empty place. They stayed there with him for about 3 weeks to attend
to his legal affairs, do </B>
<P><B>some maintenence, cleanup, and make sure that nothing was missing from
the house. The place </B>
<P><B>looked every bit the typical "haunted house" from the dust, cobwebs
and the rats all over the </B>
<P><B>place. After a few days, the house was fairly well put back into order.
I don't know the age or</B>
<P><B>history of the house, but it is supposedly fairly old. The surrounding
land is used for grazing</B>
<P><B>and hunting</B>
<P>
<P><B>One night, Frank got up to use the bathroom in the middle of the night.
Being of a thrifty nature</B>
<P><B>, he would use a flashlight to guide the way, rather than turn on the
lightswitch. He kept the </B>
<P><B>flashlight on the headboard behind him. Soon, he woke up my grandmother
in the next room and said</B>
<P><B> something like, "What am I going to do with this flashlight? It's
too hot." She didn't think </B>
<P><B>much of it at first, since Frank is quite old and of declining rationality.
He was simply not </B>
<P><B>making sense. But when he persisted, she took a look at the flashlight.
It was extremely hot to </B>
<P><B>the touch, almost too hot to hold. It was a cheap plastic flashlight,
one that probably should </B>
<P><B>have been warped or somewhat melted from the heat, but it was not.
It was not even turned on. </B>
<P><B>She thought it might have been near a heater, but it hadn't been, since
there was no heater duct</B>
<P><B> or radiator in that room, and besides it was summer, and no heating
had been used. She couldn't</B>
<P><B> find any sort of heat source nearby. So she woke up my parents, and
they also found the </B>
<P><B>flashlight strangely hot.. My father (the engineer) opened it up and
took out the batteries. Sure</B>
<P><B> enough, the batteries were causing the heat, they were burning hot.
They set the batteries on a</B>
<P><B> countertop, and in the morning they were still quite warm. Somehow
these batteries were </B>
<P><B>generating heat on an open circuit (which should be impossible) and
expending more energy than </B>
<P><B>they should have had the "juice" for. This seems not inconsistent with
ghostly phenomena, which </B>
<P><B>I've heard can involve electric, magnetic, or heat energies.</B>

<P><B>The Christmas Ghost</B>
<P>
<P><B>BY:  diamondlady63@webtv.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>Around christmas in 1995-96 my roommate and I were watching tv (the
1st</B>
<P><B>episode of X-Files) if you can believe that, when the branch of the
tree</B>
<P><B>started swinging as someone tugged on it, that was spooky enough but
we</B>
<P><B>laughed it off because of the show we were watching. Then strange
loud</B>
<P><B>sounds started to happen like something would drop in the back rooms
but</B>
<P><B>when you would go to see what it was nothing was out of place.  We</B>
<P><B>started to joke around that we had a ghost.</B>
<P><B>Then things got serious my cat would freak out in certain room and</B>
<P><B>refuse to go in them, it would hide and acted scared to death, after</B>
<P><B>about 1month of this i had to put the cat to sleep she stopped eating</B>
<P><B>and drinking. Our "ghost" had a favorite toy christmas bear that
would</B>
<P><B>play music when you touched  its paw, when you entered the house
after</B>
<P><B>being gone she would play it for you (we even took the batteries
out).</B>
<P><B>We joked we were going to put a stocking up for her (my daughter said</B>
<P><B>her name was Felisha) and I swear to god this is true when we didn't
put</B>
<P><B>the stocking up for her the following year I was sitting on the couch</B>
<P><B>and all of our stockings flew off the wall, not just one but all of</B>
<P><B>then, needless to say we made her a stocking. The only physical
evidence</B>
<P><B>I saw in my bedroom in the corner I saw a  prisum type light I asked
if</B>
<P><B>it was Felisha and it disapeared, then a small pinlight would race</B>
<P><B>around the corners of the ceiling. We were never scared of her, it
was</B>
<P><B>cool to have her around to see what she would do next. When we moved
out</B>
<P><B>of he house we asked her to come wth us. As we were unpacking in the
new</B>
<P><B>house the christmas bear started going off We were glad she was
there,</B>
<P><B>but I don't know if she liked the new place because nothing else ever</B>
<P><B>happened again like it used to. When my niece came to visit us one
day I</B>
<P><B>think Felish left with her because Heather said strange things were</B>
<P><B>happing in her house.</B>
<P><B>(Heather was alway fasinated with Felisha).</B>
<P><B>I know alot of people are afraid of ghost but I really miss it, she
did</B>
<P><B>us no harm.</B>
<P><B>There are so many things that happened in the 2 yrs she was with us
I</B>
<P><B>could go on and on, maybe later.</B>

<P><B>The Being </B>
<P>
<P><B>By:janmark@mail.atlantic.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>About 5 years ago I was sharing a room with my little brother and I</B>
<P><B>wasn't to happy about it. Well any way I was sleeping and I woke up
from</B>
<P><B>a dead sleep. I saw a figure by my door way and I didn't think much
of it</B>
<P><B>until it got closer.(it was about as big as my door way which is
about</B>
<P><B>6')It had long hair that was curly and down to mid thigh,also it had</B>
<P><B>very distinct eyes that were redden the morning I told my mom and
said</B>
<P><B>it was my imagination and not to think much of int. Didn't tell any
else</B>
<P><B>until I was at my friends 13th day party when we telling ghost
stories.</B>
<P><B>A couple of min. later we heard a noise in the family room and we got</B>
<P><B>scared. Then at night I woke up and saw the same figure but down the</B>
<P><B>hall. I said something that I can't remember what. The next day I told
my</B>
<P><B>friends and they all said they had a dream like that. Now every time
I go</B>
<P><B>to bed I say a certain prayer and then I never see him again or her</B>
<P><B>again.</B>

<P><B>Telephone Calls from the Grave???</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: Michelle.Kane@WCOM.com</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>In late June 1999 my husband's mother passed away from a long bout</B>
<P><B>of cancer.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Yesterday (8/3) around 5:00pm Mike retrieved a message on our</B>
<P><B>answering machine that gave him the chills as it sounded like his</B>
<P><B>mother. I didn't hear it and according to Mike it was almost
inaudible</B>
<P><B>but he 'thought' he heard his name 'Mike'. The first thing he thought</B>
<P><B>of that it was his Mom but of course dismissed this because it was
so</B>
<P><B>weird. He has been experiencing quite a bit of grief regarding her</B>
<P><B>death. He was really close to his Mom (only child) and they did most</B>
<P><B>of their communication over the phone (several times a week) even</B>
<P><B>though Mike was with her when she passed away. Mike didn't mention</B>
<P><B>this 'call' to me today (8/4) because of what happend this morning.</B>
<P>
<P><B>We got up today and there was a message on the machine that said
4:59am</B>
<P><B>which first was strange because we usually will hear the phone ring</B>
<P><B>any time throughout the night.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Mike listened to it first and then called me in to the kitchen. He
was</B>
<P><B>visibly shaken and asked that I listen to the message and tell him</B>
<P><B>what I thought. He mentioned that he had received a similar message</B>
<P><B>yesterday. He played it back and I got total chills! I distinctly</B>
<P><B>heard 'Mike' (even though it sounded a big garbled) and it DID sound</B>
<P><B>like his Mom. I didn't know what to say. He did erase it more out of</B>
<P><B>habit and now we wish we would have kept it.</B>
<P>
<P><B>So my question for you is have you ever heard anything like this??</B>
<P><B>I've heard poltergeists can move physical things but have never heard</B>
<P><B>anything like this.  We both this it's very strange and sort of scary...
</B>
<P>
<P><B>We don't want to make a big deal out this but it's not something you</B>
<P><B>bring up with your family by saying, 'Hey, have you received any
calls</B>
<P><B>from Mike's dead Mom lately?'</B>
<P>
<P><B>Anyway, if you have any insight I would be very interested in it.</B>
<P><B>Thanks for reading!</B>

<P><B>STRANGE HAPPENINGS BY AOLMEMBER</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B>By:IroOm100@aol.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>The story I'm going to tell happened about 3 years ago. I've just moved
in</B>
<P><B>my </B>
<P><B>husband's parents home about 11 months earlier they would tell me about
a </B>
<P><B>little girl crying for dad, or a baby crying eventhough the litle ones
were </B>
<P><B>asleep. As I was saying about 3 years ago I was in our bedroom by myself
and </B>
<P><B>my son (who was 6 months old) was asleep, I have a closet  door  with
a rack </B>
<P><B>to hang clothes on. At the time I had wire hangers hanging on the rack.
It </B>
<P><B>was about 1:30 in the morning iwas watching t.v when all of the sudden
the </B>
<P><B>wire hangers flew on the floor.It was like somebody threw them off
the </B>
<P><B>rack,that freajed me out. Another incident happened in the same room
it </B>
<P><B>involves a picture of " FOOT PRINTS IN THE SAND" My husband and I were
</B>
<P><B>sitting on our bed when out of the corner of our eyes we saw the picture
fly </B>
<P><B>back and forth very fast then stop, when my husband went over to touch
the </B>
<P><B>picture it was very cold. Heres another incident  when my
sister-in-law</B>
<P><B>and I </B>
<P><B>were sitting in the living when all of the sudden we heard a baby crying
she </B>
<P><B>got up to check on her son then on mine they were fast asleep. We sort
of</B>
<P><B>laughed it off, but we hear every so often.  </B>
<P>
<P><B> Spiritual Experience</B>
<P>
<P><B>By:  KrzyKatMer@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>Okay, I figured I'd submit mine. I think my parents..well, my father
at </B>
<P><B>least, believes I'm crazy for 'thinking' I saw something, but, oh
well.</B>
<P>
<P><B>My name is Carissa  and I am 15 years old. I live in </B>
<P><B>Maryland. </B>
<P><B>Quite a while ago, I went up to Pennsylvania with my mother to the
Antique </B>
<P><B>Shop she had rented space in. The name of the store is Sixteenth North
Main </B>
<P><B>Antiques and is located in Shrewsburry, PA. Like almost all of the
Antique </B>
<P><B>stores and such lined along the street it's located on is made up of
old</B>
<P><B>18th and 19th century houses.</B>
<P><B>The house is a row-house and is three stories high. </B>
<P>
<P><B>Mrs. Adrienne, the owner of the Store, always had two of her four dogs
in </B>
<P><B>there with her: Boomer the Boxer and Barney the Cocker Spaniel. Boomer
would </B>
<P><B>always follow me everywhere when I was there. So, I went looking around
the </B>
<P><B>shop. It was slow that day, and there were no customers inside. I walked
up </B>
<P><B>to the second floor, then to the third floor. As I was walking up the
</B>
<P><B>teal-painted staircase, with Boomer right behind me, I saw what looked
like </B>
<P><B>the a Mannequin by the window overlooking the courtyard. It stood in
front</B>
<P><B>of </B>
<P><B>the window with its hands together and its head looking at the floor.
The </B>
<P><B>'mannequin' suddenly turned to look at me. It was a young girl, she
looked </B>
<P><B>like she was only 17 or 18 years old, wearing Victorian Style clothing.
 </B>
<P><B>That's all I saw, because well, I was extremely scared and I didn't
hang </B>
<P><B>around long to study her. I turned around and almost fell down the
stairs </B>
<P><B>because Boomer was right behind me. I didn't stop until I reached Mrs.
</B>
<P><B>Adrienne's desk on the first floor. They asked me what was wrong, and
I told </B>
<P><B>them I had seen a girl upstairs. After that, I never saw her again.</B>
<P>
<P><B>My claim of seeing her wasn't completely outrageous to my mother and
Mrs. </B>
<P><B>Addrienne, since a few years ago a woman had come in, one that could
sense </B>
<P><B>spiritual presences, and asked Mrs. Addrienne if she knew she had a
Ghost in </B>
<P><B>her house.</B>
<P>
<P><B>After I saw the Ghost, no one else actually saw it, but they heard
and found </B>
<P><B>traces of it. One of the other Ladies that rented space at the shop
was </B>
<P><B>tending the store one day when she heard furniture moving around upstairs,
</B>
<P><B>but no one was upstairs. She went up to investigate but no furniture
was </B>
<P><B>moved. </B>
<P>
<P><B>Another time the same lady was tending to the store, and just before
closing </B>
<P><B>time, she put some hard candies in wrappers on a table upstairs. She
came </B>
<P><B>back down and closed the shop. </B>
<P>
<P><B>The next morning, the candies were gone, and the wrappers were discarded
on </B>
<P><B>the floor.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The house has a small courtyard in back that Mrs. Adrienne had fixed
up, and </B>
<P><B>when it was nice she would often do paperwork or eat lunch out there.
The </B>
<P><B>shop was closed that particular day, so she sat outside and did paperwork.
</B>
<P><B>She saw something in the corner of her eye and looked up. Someone was</B>
<P><B>looking </B>
<P><B>out the same window I had seen the ghost standing by. As Mrs. Adrienne
stood </B>
<P><B>up, it drew the curtain and dissapeared. </B>
<P>
<P><B>That is the last time anyone has seen or heard from the Spirit. We
don't</B>
<P><B>know why she is always on the third floor at that window, and why she
died so </B>
<P><B>young. </B>
<P>
<P><B>I'm no Ghost Expert, and that is the only Experience I have had with
one, so </B>
<P><B>I can't have much input on why she's there, and what she wants. Simply
a</B>
<P><B>fact passed on...</B>
<P>
<P><B>Spirits in a Bed and Breakfast?</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: LinMess@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>A couple of weeks ago my husband and I were staying in a bed and
breakfast</B>
<P><B>in </B>
<P><B>Spring Lake, NJ. The first night there, my husband was just falling
asleep </B>
<P><B>and I was reading, then we both became aware of the bed shaking ever
so </B>
<P><B>slightly back and forth. I thought he was may be shaking his leg and
at the </B>
<P><B>same time we both turned to each other and said "Are you shaking the
bed?" </B>
<P><B>neither one of us was. This continued for about five minutes then stopped.
</B>
<P><B>About 20 minutes later it started again, then stopped. At first we
thought </B>
<P><B>maybe people were walking up the stairs causing the floor to shake
but that </B>
<P><B>wasn't the case.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The room behind us wasn't occupied, nor was the room below us. We though
</B>
<P><B>maybe the central was causing the floor to shake but the room below
us</B>
<P><B>wasn't </B>
<P><B>occupied and it had a windon unit in it and wasn't on. During the night
</B>
<P><B>around 3 or 4 am we both startled awake. I thought I heard something,
like a </B>
<P><B>high pitched noise and my husband thought he also heard a noise but
couldn't </B>
<P><B>figure out where it was coming from. What would make us both wake up
so </B>
<P><B>startled at the same time? Nothing happened the next night, but on
the third </B>
<P><B>night as I was falling asleep,  the one side of my hair, which was
laying on </B>
<P><B>the pillow suddenly flew into my face as if it was just "flipped" over
my </B>
<P><B>face.  What do you make of this. I thought it was some sort of funny
spirit </B>
<P><B>playing games, but my husband just thinks it was the house settling
or some </B>
<P><B>such excuse?  Please send me your thoughts.  Thank you. </B>

<P><B>All Around Me</B>
<P><B>By:rodriguezmonique@yahoo.com</B>
<P><B>I was moving out of an apartment in Sanger. I had always lived back
and forth from Fresno to </B>
<P><B>Sanger, but I guess by me growing up in that apartment, the ghost would
take care of me. The </B>
<P><B>ghost knew that the last time I was moving, it was for good. Thats
when I saw mean,white eyes on</B>
<P><B>the tv screen.I ran out of the apartment scared. </B>
<P><B>The house I live in now is haunted by a young male. He's wearing a
brownish/ kackie checkered </B>
<P><B>shirt and some kackie slack type pants. The storie on him is that he
was shot in the front of my </B>
<P><B>house on Memorial or Labor day.(One of the two, I don't remember.)
It was some years back though</B>
<P><B>. I don't know his name so I call him Peetie. I know that he knows
my name though.</B>
<P><B>I sometimes talk to the ghost as if they were just like you and I,
in flesh and bones. I can see</B>
<P><B> them,or I have mind visionsof them. I can feel them around me at times.Its
not the houses I live</B>
<P><B> in most of the time that is haunted, I have ghost that are always
around me at all times. They </B>
<P><B>are not all the same ones either.</B>
<P><B>Thank you for your time,</B>

<P><B>Ghost Sightings!</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: BlainePane@webtv.net</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>I am 31 years old and have been living in Tampa, Florida-- for most
of</B>
<P><B>my life. I lived in the same house for about 13 of those years.
(Once,</B>
<P><B>moving clear across the country(New Mexico) only to come right back
to</B>
<P><B>the same house three years later.) I do not recall anything strange</B>
<P><B>about the house the first time we lived in it. Although, my younger</B>
<P><B>sister did! She was forever awaking me in the middle of the night to</B>
<P><B>tell me she saw monsters. I shrugged this off to imagination, but
when</B>
<P><B>we moved back--I no longer disbelieved her--I saw things myself! My</B>
<P><B>younger brother had started to refuse to sleep in his own room---but</B>
<P><B>would never explain why. So, we (My sister and I) just thought that
he</B>
<P><B>was being immature. I did not tease him about this, because our house</B>
<P><B>only had three bedrooms----and this was my "ticket," to my own space.</B>
<P><B>The first night I slept in the room--I awoke to see what appeared to
be</B>
<P><B>three balls of light --circling near my bed. The balls would circle,</B>
<P><B>zoom-in, zoom-out and then circle again. This did not frighten me,
it</B>
<P><B>merely intrigued me. This continued to happen frequently during the</B>
<P><B>remaining 5 years that I resided in the house. As to what "they"
 were,</B>
<P><B>I do not know! And I also do not care to know, because this
particular</B>
<P><B>activity did not elicit fear from me. However, I am fairly certain
that</B>
<P><B>I did not imagine those balls of light. What did frighten me though,
was</B>
<P><B>the "other" activity--in the house. This being, the apparition which</B>
<P><B>tried to lift me up and out of the bed. It would start by gently
pulling</B>
<P><B>my blankets and sheets off of me and then slowly begin to levitate
me. I</B>
<P><B>would always awaken when this happened--and I would grab ahold
of&nbsp;the</B>
<P><B>sides of my bed and hang on for dear life. The ordeal would always
cease</B>
<P><B>there and I would lie frightened until I fell back to sleep. Nothing</B>
<P><B>else happened, no banging of doors, rattling of closets, no flying</B>
<P><B>objects. no voices nor blood spouting from walls and/or sinks. Just</B>
<P><B>three balls of light and one levitating apparition. I do not know the</B>
<P><B>history of the house--I do not know who lived there nor when they
lived</B>
<P><B>there-- or if anyone has died in the house--or if anyone who may have</B>
<P><B>moved in  since my family and I moved out have seen these claims.</B>

<P><B>Strong Feelings</B>

<P>
<P><B>It happened about months ago in Salem, MA   I was staying over a
friends</B>
<P><B>house in my friend's Jeff's room who was away for the week.  I also
have another</B>
<P><B>friend John who lives in the same bldg.  The best way to describe it
is</B>
<P><B>almost like 2 three-decker bldg in 1 with 2 separate entrances.  Jeff's
room in</B>
<P><B>on the left hand side of the bldg on the first floor facing the street.
 John is on</B>
<P><B>the right hand side on the 2nd floor also facing the street.  While
I was</B>
<P><B>sleeping I felt someone kneeling on the bed looking over my shoulder.
 I felt</B>
<P><B>very warm right after this.  I was facing the wall with my back to
the door. </B>
<P><B>The feeling was pretty strong, but I thought it was 1 of my friends,
so I</B>
<P><B>didn't turn around.  The next morning I asked if anyone came in the
room</B>
<P><B>becuz I thought I heard something.  Nobody did.  I totally forgot about
it until a</B>
<P><B>few days later when I was talking to John.  He told me a very similar
story. </B>
<P><B>He felt someone looking down at him from the foot of the bed.  Later
that</B>
<P><B>night, when he got up to get something to drink, he felt "eyes on his
back" </B>
<P><B>The feeling was very strong.  He also felt warm after this happened.
 When</B>
<P><B>Jeff  returned, I told him what happened to me.  I said it happens
to him almost</B>
<P><B>every night.  He never said anything because he thought we would think
he was</B>
<P><B>imagining things.  He said it started right after he moved in &amp;
its been 2</B>
<P><B>yrs now.  John has lived there 3 yrs &amp; this is the 1st time for
him.  It hasn't</B>
<P><B>happened since to him, but continues to Jeff.  The weird part is this</B>
<P><B>happened to John when noone was sleeping in Jeff's room.  Both rooms
face the street,</B>
<P><B>but on opposite sides of the bldg on different floors.  What do you
think of</B>
<P><B>this? </B>

<P><B>WWW at my fingertips, it is how I found your site. I live in Upper</B>
<P><B>Michigan, otherwise known as the Upper Peninsula.  I live in a town
called</B>
<P><B>Kingsford.  Anyways, here's the scenario.  I have lived in my house(My
mom</B>
<P><B>and I) for about 4 years.  Not once have I ever seen or felt a
distrubance.</B>
<P><B>I'm the kind of person who believes in things like this but I'm
skeptical</B>
<P><B>when people tell me their stories of hauntings or whatever. Basically,
I</B>
<P><B>have to see it to believe it. About a month ago I was out of town and
so</B>
<P><B>was my mom.  My doors were locked, but my  neighbor came over to see
if she</B>
<P><B>could see any smoke or anything when she heard my smoke alarms going
off.</B>
<P><B>Apparently, not only were they sounding but they would shut off and
on.  TO</B>
<P><B>the best of my knowledege, smoke alarms keep going off until someone
hits</B>
<P><B>the button or takes out the battery.  My neighbor called the person
who was</B>
<P><B>watching our house(my Aunt) and she had the fire dept come in and see
if</B>
<P><B>there was anything wrong....nothing was found to have smoke damage
or any</B>
<P><B>sign of fire.  OK, it struck me as wierd but big deal, it could have
been</B>
<P><B>something stupid that set them off, I just wrote it off and thought
nothing</B>
<P><B>of it.  About a week and a half ago, I woke up out at 4:00 AM exactly
in my</B>
<P><B>room.  My room is very small.  When I looked up I saw a light in my
room.</B>
<P><B>Not some mystical light or anything, it was a regular light the size
of a</B>
<P><B>keychain light.  Not bright enough to light up my room but still it
was a</B>
<P><B>light none the less.  I immedietly assumed someone was in my room,
I was</B>
<P><B>pretty scared.  I put my head under my covers and listened to see if
I</B>
<P><B>could hear anything moving around.  I heard nothing.  Pitch black or
not</B>
<P><B>people have the ability to sense if something is 2 feet in front of
them or</B>
<P><B>not.  I saw nothing behind this light, no sillouette, no hand holding
it.</B>
<P><B>The light moved slowly, as if someone was just kind of scoping things
out.</B>
<P><B>Suprisingly I didn't feel very threatened, but I was scared.  It
looked</B>
<P><B>like the keychain light that hangs just right outside the door of my
room.</B>
<P><B>I just put my head under my covers like a child and about 15 minutes
later</B>
<P><B>I fell back to sleep.  That morning I left for Woodstock 99 so I was
gone</B>
<P><B>for the rest of the week.  When I returned, my mom was leaving for
vaction,</B>
<P><B>in fact she will be returning today.  The first night back I had a
buddy</B>
<P><B>crash at my house. I saw nothing, heard nothing. Same thing the next
night,</B>
<P><B>except this time I slept with the TV on because it was the first night
by</B>
<P><B>myself since the light thing.  I saw nothing once again.  Then, last
night</B>
<P><B>I had my cousin and his girlfriend over.  I was on a couch perpendicular
to</B>
<P><B>them on the other couch.  We were talking and they both turned their
heads</B>
<P><B>at the same time as if they saw something.  They knew nothing of what
had</B>
<P><B>been going on.  My cousin said "jeez, if I wouldn't know better I would
say</B>
<P><B>your house is haunted" in a joking fashion.  Then I told him the
things</B>
<P><B>that have been going on.  He made me go with him and sleep at his
house.</B>
<P><B>What they both had claimed to see was a white "mass" that moved
quickly</B>
<P><B>into one of the bedroom doors.  Since I didn't see it myself I can't</B>
<P><B>necessarily believe them.  My cousin is the type of guy that sees a
plane</B>
<P><B>and thinks it's a UFO.  So I don't want to jump to conclusions.</B>
<P><B>Everything(except for the light thing in my room ) can be explained
with</B>
<P><B>some kind of rational explanation.  What I mean is it could be written
off</B>
<P><B>as a common occurence.  I've never seen any doors slamming or any kind
of</B>
<P><B>ghostly like figure. Nothing has ever been thrown across the room or</B>
<P><B>floated by me. I've never heard voices. But this stuff does seem kind
of</B>
<P><B>wierd.  Sometimes I get the feeling as if though I'm being watched.
 Maybe</B>
<P><B>this is paranoia but I just have that wierd feeling. My logical sense
tells</B>
<P><B>me that these occurences are just freak things that conincidentally
are</B>
<P><B>happneing at the same time.  My insides tell me that there is
something</B>
<P><B>there.  I don't know what to think. I was wondering where to turn to.
 I</B>
<P><B>wish I knew of somebody who could come to my house; a psychic or
someting,</B>
<P><B>and tell me if there is anything there. I can assure you I am as
straight</B>
<P><B>as an arrow.  I'm not into heavy drugs and I have no history of any
mental</B>
<P><B>problems.  My question is, what do I do now? Do I wait until I see</B>
<P><B>something more obvious?  I can tell you, that light thing was  REAL.</B>

<P>
<P><B>When I was 6 or 8 years old I lived in a house in Portland Maine with</B>
<P><B>my mother and sister.The year would be around 1977 or 78.</B>
<P><B>A young guy was walking outside the house and to my mothers request
I</B>
<P><B>asked if there was something I could help him with. He responded by</B>
<P><B>saying he used to live there and would like to look around.</B>
<P><B>My mother then invited him in.</B>
<P><B>He told her his grandfather died in the livingroom....after falling
down</B>
<P><B>the stairs.</B>
<P><B>My mother would smell a cherry smell every now and then for no
apparent</B>
<P><B>reason.</B>
<P><B>She asked him if his grandfather smoked a pipe and the young man
replied</B>
<P><B>yes. after asking what flavor he responded "cherry".</B>
<P><B>He told her of a reoccuring dream he had as a boy....he would walk</B>
<P><B>upstairs to the attic and upon entering would see a glowing chest.
When</B>
<P><B>he opened it there was a woman all chopped up into pieces. When he</B>
<P><B>described her dress, cameo, and hair in a silver bun, my mothers jaw</B>
<P><B>dropped. She went to the photo album and showed him her wedding
picture</B>
<P><B>from the day she was married in the backyard a year or so before. He
had</B>
<P><B>completely described my mother. I'm not sure of whether it was before
or</B>
<P><B>after that, that i was sitting in the livingroom with my babysitter
and</B>
<P><B>I saw an "aparition" walk from a hallway to our den.</B>
<P><B>It didn't scare me, though i was very young, but I can remember it
as</B>
<P><B>clear as day.</B>
<P><B>After telling my mother, we noticed that our dog tippy would not go
in</B>
<P><B>the den. We tried putting meat on the floor and everything else but
she</B>
<P><B>would'nt budge. She would only cry. so my stepfather picked her up
and</B>
<P><B>sat her in there. She sat, shaking, staring at a chair. My mother sat
in</B>
<P><B>the chair and tippy's eyes slowly turned up and over to another
chair.</B>
<P><B>  I told this story to my ex-girlfriend and like everyone she said</B>
<P><B>"really?...wow" but like everyone I know she was thinking "yeah, ok"</B>
<P><B>untill we were in bed one night, living across the street from were
my</B>
<P><B>stepmothers wake was, and while watching t.v. We both saw a white
figure</B>
<P><B>walk by our hallway the night of the wake. She asked me to check it
out</B>
<P><B>and i said hell no! When I said that she realized that what we saw
was</B>
<P><B>no person walking through the wall......and I think she then believed</B>
<P><B>what I had told her before.</B>

<P><B>Personal Story</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: cardinaldove@yahoo.com</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>Right now I live in a small town in Texas. But I have also lived in</B>
<P><B>Indiana, Illinois, and Virginia. And everywhere I have been, I have</B>
<P><B>found evidence of paranormal activity. I am 16 and have just recently</B>
<P><B>moved to Texas. My story goes back to when I was about, 6 or 7, so
about</B>
<P><B>ten years(or even farther than that). My first experience that I can</B>
<P><B>remember is when I was living in Norfolk, VA, on the Naval Base. I</B>
<P><B>remember waking up on night and looking into my closet. What I saw,
was</B>
<P><B>basically a man in what appeared to be clothing that was from the
days</B>
<P><B>of the Revolution, and just stood there for a couple of minutes
staring</B>
<P><B>at me and my brother. Then there was another time when I thought I
saw</B>
<P><B>the living room light on. I thought I was just my mom staying up late</B>
<P><B>watching TV. But what I saw changed my mind. A man ran into my room</B>
<P><B>carrying a butcher knife. His clothes were all soaked with blood, and</B>
<P><B>right before he got to me, he disappeared. After those experiences,
the</B>
<P><B>ones I had started to become childish. I would wake up and hear the
TV</B>
<P><B>on, but when I go out to check, it's off. One night I looked up at
my</B>
<P><B>Ghostbusters 2 movie poster, and the ghost winked and gave me a
thumbs</B>
<P><B>up. Another night I went down stairs to get a snack. Even though</B>
<P><B>everybody was asleep, I heard a child's voice call out my name and
then</B>
<P><B>yell BOO.</B>
<P><B>Once I moved up to Indiana, things that were happening to me, seemed
to</B>
<P><B>get worse and worse. I would always be followed by a man in a black</B>
<P><B>trench coat a nd a black hat. Strange knockings in the middle of the</B>
<P><B>night, that would wake up my brother and me, and not my parents. One</B>
<P><B>morning, my house caught fire mysteriously. Nobody knows who did it.
I</B>
<P><B>have also been thrown across my basement, my brothers girlfriend has</B>
<P><B>been scrathched several times over her body. When I moved to Texas,
I</B>
<P><B>thought things would get better. But they've turned progessively
worse.</B>
<P><B>One night I thought I heard desperate cries for help under a bunch
of</B>
<P><B>aluminum siding. Ialso keep seeing that same man in a blck coat and</B>
<P><B>black hat. I also have experienced doors opening and closing by</B>
<P><B>themselves, strance voices, fellings of evil, and apparitions. Just</B>
<P><B>right now as I have been writing this, I keep seeing flashes of
yellow</B>
<P><B>light in front of me on the wall. But the wierdest thing that has</B>
<P><B>happened to me is this. One night as I was playing with one of the</B>
<P><B>puppies from a neighbors house, and I heard some dogs howling in the</B>
<P><B>distance. The problem was, I actually understood what they were
howling.</B>
<P><B>I just decided to right this to get it off my chest. I don't have
many</B>
<P><B>people to tell except my brother and his girlfriend, because they
have</B>
<P><B>had worse experiences.</B>
