<b>The Story of Simon</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: Caristione@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My high-school sweetheart, Tony, had an older
sister, Angelina, who</b>
<br><b>related this story to me.&nbsp; I think it needs to be shared here.</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shortly after Tony's birth, when Angelina was
6, the family bought and</b>
<br><b>moved into a large old farmhouse off the beaten track in a very
historical</b>
<br><b>area.&nbsp; About six months after taking residence, Angie began
to notice strange</b>
<br><b>things.&nbsp; Being a six-year-old tomboy, Angie was a fearless
child, and never</b>
<br><b>thought for a moment that she should be frightened by these happenings.&nbsp;
The</b>
<br><b>television would go on or off when Angie was alone in the room.&nbsp;
The family</b>
<br><b>heirloom bentwood rocker in her bedroom would rock whenever Angie
laid down</b>
<br><b>for the night.&nbsp; Her mother tells me that Angie would sit and
talk when she</b>
<br><b>was alone in a room.&nbsp; Angie tells me that many times she would
know someone</b>
<br><b>was in the room with her.&nbsp; She couldn't see anything, or feel
anything, but</b>
<br><b>she just knew.&nbsp; The "entity" also seemed very protective of
the baby,</b>
<br><b>covering him up in his crib when he kicked off the blanket, or turning
off</b>
<br><b>the light in the nursery when Angie or her parents accidentally
(or</b>
<br><b>purposely!) left it on.</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a year, Angie began to call this entity
Simon, partly after a</b>
<br><b>character in her favourite book, and partly because, as she says,
"The name</b>
<br><b>just came to me one day".&nbsp; She told her parents about Simon.&nbsp;
Her mother</b>
<br><b>partly believed her.&nbsp; Her father chalked it up to an imaginary
friend.&nbsp; Simon</b>
<br><b>was always with her, she told me, no matter where she went, but
his presence</b>
<br><b>was always strongest in the house and in the yard.&nbsp; He never
spoke to her,</b>
<br><b>nor did he ever manifest himself to her.</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Angelina grew up, she started to question Simon's
existence, and</b>
<br><b>almost talked herself into believing that her father was right;
Simon was</b>
<br><b>only a young girl's imaginary friend.&nbsp; But when the day came,
when Angie was</b>
<br><b>16, to move out of the old farmhouse, Simon seemed a little confused.&nbsp;
She</b>
<br><b>stood in her empty bedroom, the rest of the family outside loading
the truck.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;A sudden breeze blew into the room, when the window was firmly
shut.&nbsp; It</b>
<br><b>seemed to circle the room, then go out the door to the next bedroom,
which</b>
<br><b>had been Tony's room.&nbsp; It came back in, a bit stronger this
time, and circled</b>
<br><b>the room again.&nbsp; It blew straight at Angie, and in her own
words, "Just</b>
<br><b>dissipated... never actually "left"... as if I had absorbed it..."</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the years passed, Angie became a beautiful,
headstrong, willful</b>
<br><b>full-blooded Italian woman with scores of suitors.&nbsp; She says
that whenever</b>
<br><b>she dated a man who turned out to be a bad seed, she would feel
sudden</b>
<br><b>attacks of anxiety, or what she called "bad vibes".&nbsp; She would
always end the</b>
<br><b>relationship soon afterwards.&nbsp; It was only after she became
engaged that she</b>
<br><b>came to believe that it was Simon, protecting her from the "wrong
men".</b>
<br><b>Other than that, Simon stayed quiet.</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Angolan is married now, a mother of three.&nbsp;
I spoke to her a year ago,</b>
<br><b>before she and her family moved to England.&nbsp; She reported that
she had</b>
<br><b>finally worked up the nerve to go back home and research the farmhouse
they</b>
<br><b>had lived in.&nbsp; What she found made cold fingers crawl up her
back.&nbsp; The house</b>
<br><b>had been built in 1842, by a young farmer for his new bride.&nbsp;
The young man</b>
<br><b>enlisted to fight for the Union shortly after, and a short year
later, left</b>
<br><b>his bride a widow.&nbsp; The young farmer's name was Simon.</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She also reported that Simon had all but disappeared
from her life.&nbsp; His</b>
<br><b>last visit was on the night she went into labor with her firstborn.&nbsp;
It was 3</b>
<br><b>o'clock in the morning when the pain started, so intense all she
could do was</b>
<br><b>cry and wail.&nbsp; Her husband was working the late shift, and
wouldn't be home</b>
<br><b>for another couple of hours.&nbsp; Unable to move from the bed to
the phone, she</b>
<br><b>just laid there and screamed.&nbsp; Finally, in a moment of desperation,
she</b>
<br><b>mumbled, "Simon, help me!"&nbsp; Twenty minutes later, the pain
lessened enough to</b>
<br><b>allow her to walk to the phone and call her husband.</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her first child was christened James Alexander
Simon.</b>

<p><b>I AM ON YOUR WESITE BECAUSE MY BOYFRIEND RUNS A THEATER IN DOWNTOWN

<br><b>AND IT HAS OTHER WORLDLY OCCUPANTS.&nbsp; THE BUILDING HAS BEEN
AROUND SINCE</b>
<br><b>1897 AND WAS A SCHOOL UNTIL 1978 WHERE A FIRE KILLED A LITTLE GIRL.

RUN THE</b>
<br><b>THEATER HAVE SEEN AND HEARD THINGS.&nbsp; I MYSELF HAVE FELT THE
COLD</b>
<br><b>ASSOCIATED WITH PRESENCE IN A PARTICULAR ROOM.&nbsp; ALL ME HAIRS
STOOD ON</b>
<br><b>END AND IN MY GUT I FELT WE NEEDED TO LEAVE THE ROOM.&nbsp; THERE
ARE TWO</b>
<br><b>PARTICULAR EVENTS WHICH SOLIDIFY MY SUSPICIONS:&nbsp; I GOT A CALL
FROM MY</b>
<br><b>BYFD ONE NIGHT TO TELL ME HE WAS COMING HOME EARLY.&nbsp; IN THE
BACKGROUND I</b>
<br><b>HEARD MALE LAUGHTER, LIKE SOMEONE WAS PLAYING A JOKE ON HIM AND
REALLY</b>
<br><b>ENJOYING IT. I THOUGHT NOTHING OF IT, HE WORKS WITH COUPLE GUYS
DOWN AT</b>
<br><b>THE THEATER.&nbsp; WHEN HE CAME HOME HE TOLD ME HE HAD BEEN DUMPING
THE</b>
<br><b>EVENINGS GARBAGE.&nbsp; THE DUMPSTER IS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRS
ON THE</b>
<br><b>NORTH (?) SIDE OF THE SCHOOL.&nbsp; AS HE WAS GOING DOWN THE STAIRS
HE SAW A</b>
<br><b>FIGURE CUT ACROSS THE ROOM AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRS.&nbsp; HE
CALLED OUT</b>
<br><b>THINKING IT WAS THE BUILDINGS HANDY MAN.&nbsp; NO ANSWER.&nbsp;
HE REACHED THE</b>
<br><b>BOTTOM OF THE STAIRS AND DEPOSITED THE GARBAGE BAG AND HEADED BACK
UP</b>
<br><b>THE STAIRS TO GET THE OTHER BAG OF GARBAGE.&nbsp; AT THAT MOMENT
IS WHEN HE</b>
<br><b>HEARD WHAT SOUNDED LIKE SOMEONE DRAGGING THE BAG HE HAD JUST DEPOSITED.</b>
<br><b>HE STOPPED, TURNED AND CALLED OUT.&nbsp; THE NOISE STOPPED.&nbsp;
HE DISMISSED IT</b>
<br><b>(HE DOESN'T REALLY BELIEVE ANY OF THIS, THAT IS UNTIL LAST NIGHT...MORE</b>
<br><b>LATER) AND BROUGHT THE OTHER BAG DOWN.&nbsp; HE HEADED BACK UP AND
THE SAME</b>
<br><b>THING HAPPENED.&nbsp; THIS TIME HE DID NOT GO BACK DOWN, BUT INSTEAD
CALLED</b>
<br><b>ME TO TELL ME HE WAS ON HIS WAY UPTOWN.&nbsp; LATER THAT NIGHT,
IN BED, HE</b>
<br><b>TOLD ME WHAT HAD HAPPENED.&nbsp; I ASKED HIM WHO WAS WITH HIM WHEN
HE CALLED</b>
<br><b>ME, AND HE SAID HE WAS ALONE.&nbsp; ALL MY HAIRS STOOD ON END.&nbsp;
"WHO WAS THAT</b>
<br><b>LAUGHING THEN?'&nbsp; I ASKED.&nbsp; HE SAID HE WAS ALONE WHEN HE
CALLED.&nbsp; I THINK</b>
<br><b>HE THOUGHT IT WAS MY IMAGINGATION OR A BAD CONNECTION, BUT I KNOW
WHAT I</b>
<br><b>HEARD.</b><b></b>
<p><b>NOW.</b><b></b>
<p><b>LAST NIGHT I WAS AT THE THEATER, SOME FASHION SHOW GOING ON THERE.&nbsp;
MY</b>
<br><b>BYFD TELLS ME WHAT HAPPENED THE NITE BEFORE.&nbsp; HE HAD SPENT
THE NIGHT AT</b>
<br><b>THE THEATER ON&nbsp; A PULL OUT MATTTRESS THE GUYS KEEP THERE FOR
LATE NIGHT</b>
<br><b>WORK.&nbsp; IT WAS AROUND MIDNIGHT AND HE WAS NOT ASLEEP, HE WAS
STARING UP</b>
<br><b>AT THE CEILING RETHINKING HIS DAY.&nbsp; HE HEARD HIS NAME CALLED
OUT.&nbsp; THEN</b>
<br><b>THE DOOR TO THE OFFICE SLOWLY CLOSED AS IF SOMEONE WAS CLOSING IT
FROM</b>
<br><b>BEHIND.&nbsp; HE RESPONDED AND PEEKED OUT TO HIS DESK TO SEE IF
SOMEHOW A CAT</b>
<br><b>HAD FOUND IT'S WAY IN TO THE BUILING (WHICH IS LUDICROUS, ONE DOESN'T</b>
<br><b>SEE&nbsp; CATS AROUND THERE) AND OF COURSE HE FOUND NOTHING. ALL
THE WINDOWS</b>
<br><b>WERE CLOSED, SO NO BREEZE BLEW IN.&nbsp; HE SAID HE THEN HEARD WHAT
SOUNDED</b>
<br><b>LIKE WHISPERING, OUTSIDE THE OFFICE DOOR. LOTS OF WHISPERING (STAGE</b>
<br><b>WHISPER) OF GIBBERISH WITH SOME STRONG HISSING SOUNDS PLACED IN,
ALMOST</b>
<br><b>LIKE A SNAKE , HISSING SOUND.&nbsp; HE CALLED OUT AGAIN AND BANGED
ON THE</b>
<br><b>DOOR.&nbsp; HE WENT BACK INTO THE ADJOINING OFFICE AND WENT TOWARDS
THE</b>
<br><b>DOOR.&nbsp; HE THEN FELT A COLD COMING IN FROM UNDER THE DOOR. HE
PLACED HIS</b>
<br><b>HAND IN THE CRACK AT THE BOTTOM OF THE DOOR AND FELT NO BREEZE.&nbsp;
THEN A</b>
<br><b>SCRATCHING SOUND, FAST REPETITIONS, LIKE A DOG SCRATCHING TO GET
IN</b>
<br><b>STARTED.&nbsp; THIS WAS TOO MUCH FOR HIM, HE PACKED UP AND CALMLY
WALKED</b>
<br><b>OUT.&nbsp; HE SAID HE WAS&nbsp; AFRAID TO LOOK BACK ONCE HE LEFT
THE THEATER</b>
<br><b>OFFICE, AFRAID OF WHAT HE MIGHT SEE.&nbsp; I THINK BEING A THEATER,
AND MANY</b>
<br><b>ACTORS WHO LOVED THE SPACE LEFT PARTS OF THEM WHEN THEY DIED, THE</b>
<br><b>FOUNDER DIED OF LEUKEMIA AND LOVED AND LIVED FOR THIS THEATER COMPANY.</b>
<br><b>THE LITTLE GIRL WHO DIED IN THE FIRE ALSO STANDS MY HAIR ON END.
LAS</b>

<p><b>&nbsp;I was at my friends house a while back and we were sitting
in the camper</b>
<br><b>while waiting for her mares to foal and the t.v started to turn
off and then</b>
<br><b>flashed the word hi. And she started to tell me about the things
that would</b>
<br><b>happen on the ranch but I didn't really think much of it, Untill
tonight we</b>
<br><b>were sitting in the back by the very back barn which no one uses
or goes</b>
<br><b>into. All of the sudden I looked up and saw a white flash of a person
go</b>
<br><b>across the stall door and I heard a sound like high pitched scratching
and</b>
<br><b>then I took off running and she stayed and saw that the stall door
opened and</b>
<br><b>it has not been opened in a year. When I was running it felt like
a dream</b>
<br><b>where you aren't going anywhere. I would really appriciate it if
you could</b>
<br><b>write me back and tell me more about what I saw and felt. Also tell
me if you</b>

<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I will just give you folks a little history on my sitation.&nbsp;
I for the</b>
<br><b>most part believe in a lot of things, if people start acting a little</b>
<br><b>crazed, I look to the moon.&nbsp;&nbsp; I strongly believe in the
whole ghost</b>
<br><b>thing but other than hearing some really strange noises here and
there</b>
<br><b>have yet to really encounter anything visual.&nbsp; Until now....</b>
<br><b>I just recently moved into an old English Tudor house, built approx
in</b>
<br><b>the 1800's accourding to our land lords.&nbsp; The first night that
we (my</b>
<br><b>best friend and I) moved our stuff in we were sitting in her bedroom,</b>
<br><b>discussing just how awesome this old house was, being that it bared
a</b>
<br><b>huge fire place made of Mahogany, with all Mahogany trim throughout
the</b>
<br><b>house and built in book shelves with old glass doors, etc.&nbsp;
This house</b>
<br><b>has two stairways one thatis open&nbsp; and carpeted lets say the
"main"</b>
<br><b>staircase.&nbsp; The other is a service stair that the servants
of the time</b>
<br><b>would use that leads from one of the bedrooms to the kitchen, as
to not</b>
<br><b>wake the family while getting ready to prepare breakfast or what</b>
<br><b>nott.... down in the basement there is&nbsp; maid quarters, a bathtub
(very</b>
<br><b>old an dirty) a non-functioning sink. and a toilet that looks as
to not</b>
<br><b>have worked since the early 1900's at least (it's bad!).&nbsp; A
beutifal</b>
<br><b>sunroom, a breakfast nook, large formal dining room with french
doors</b>
<br><b>connecting the living room and the sun room, a complete basement
and two</b>
<br><b>other bedrooms.&nbsp; Downstairs on the first floor there is&nbsp;
a small closet</b>
<br><b>like bathroom and upstairs there is a more modern newly remodeled
full</b>
<br><b>bath.( sorry if this seems drawn out but you have to have the picture
to</b>
<br><b>understand what I will soon be telling you).</b>
<br><b>So back to the night that we moved in.&nbsp; My friend and I are
sitting in</b>
<br><b>her room putting things in there place discussing the house.&nbsp;
I looked</b>
<br><b>at her and asked her if she felt like we were not alone in the house???</b>
<br><b>She with this relieved look on her face sighed, she had been thinking</b>
<br><b>the same thing but did not want me to think that she was a freak
for</b>
<br><b>thinking that.</b>
<br><b>At the time I set up my bed so that it was next to the window across</b>
<br><b>from the door, it would get rather hot some nights from the radiator</b>
<br><b>that I would leave my door open so that the air would circulate.&nbsp;
My 3</b>
<br><b>year old son sleeps with me often and that night was fast asleep.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I</b>
<br><b>too was in the major drooling mode sawing some serious logs, when</b>
<br><b>suddenly I was awakened by this very loud noise, oddly enough I
could</b>
<br><b>not tell you what kind of noise that it was, just that it was a
noise</b>
<br><b>loud enough to wake ME up, (the girl who can sleep throught a blood</b>
<br><b>curdeling alarm clock for hours) when I looked out I saw a women
in a</b>
<br><b>white robe similar to the one my roomate wore.&nbsp; I thought that
it was</b>
<br><b>odd that she was up and about without turning on any lights because
she</b>
<br><b>was scared shittless of the place, so that on the first night we
stayed</b>
<br><b>here she made me sleep in her room.&nbsp; I called out to her and
the figure</b>
<br><b>quickly disapaeard down the main stairs , never answered me and
did not</b>
<br><b>miss a stride as&nbsp; "it walked down the stairs. The next incident
happend</b>
<br><b>to my roomate, she was here alone, getting ready for work, about
6:00</b>
<br><b>am.&nbsp; She heard some&nbsp; rummaging around in the kitchen,
not thinking</b>
<br><b>anything of it she assumed it was me coming home from babysitting
at my</b>
<br><b>sisters house, she called out to "me" and "I" did not answer, she
leaned</b>
<br><b>over the banister and yelled to "me" again, but still no answer,
all the</b>
<br><b>while cuboard doors were slamming shut and drawers were opening
and</b>
<br><b>shutting like someone was looking for something, when I never came
up</b>
<br><b>the stairs to talk to her she thought hmmm Matilda must be messing
with</b>
<br><b>me (Matilda is the name we gave "her") then she challenged her with
a</b>
<br><b>statement of, if&nbsp; Matilda was here she would let me know I
am sure, with</b>
<br><b>that instant, her bedroom light started to flicker off and on, then</b>
<br><b>finally quit.&nbsp; She went to work just freaking, when I got home
she says,</b>
<br><b>"you weren't by chance home today about oohhh 6 amish?" I told her
no</b>
<br><b>and she proceeded to tell me what had happened, I thought that maybe
my</b>
<br><b>dad had come over that early to get something out of the basement
he was</b>
<br><b>going to come get but when I questioned him he did not come over
until</b>
<br><b>way after 10:00 am.&nbsp; Sad to say it but that is still not the
weirdest</b>
<br><b>thing to happen yet, just recently my roomie, God love her, went
to a</b>
<br><b>rummage, having a fettish for old antique dolls she picked a couple
of</b>
<br><b>them up....and I have a feeling that isn't all she picked up.&nbsp;
I was</b>
<br><b>laying in her bed one morning as she went to go pick up my son and
take</b>
<br><b>hers to school, after a long night out drinking I was still sleeping.&nbsp;
I</b>
<br><b>felt&nbsp; as though someone had crawled in bed with me, I tried
to open my</b>
<br><b>eyes but could only get them to open about half way like I couldn't
wake</b>
<br><b>up, I expected to see my son but no one was there that I could see,
but</b>
<br><b>I could feel them, next I heard in a really raspy voice, "HI" and
then</b>
<br><b>laughter, I asked who are you but it came out all muffuled I couldn't</b>
<br><b>even talk, I felt all heavy I couldn't move, then it felt like whoever</b>
<br><b>it was or whatever it was "steam rolled me" like we used to do at</b>
<br><b>slumber parties when I was 12,&nbsp; I mummbled leave me alone I
am sleeping,</b>
<br><b>and the body rolled off the bed laughing almost like a kid playing
or</b>
<br><b>something.&nbsp; I would not believe it if I did not witness it
and that is</b>
<br><b>so totally not all.&nbsp; But I think that you get the jist of it.&nbsp;
Tell me</b>
<br><b>what you think!&nbsp; I have seen alot of weird ass things in my
life, but</b>
<br><b>the day my exboyfriends picture, that had been sitting on the mantal,</b>
<br><b>flew off at him out of no where I got a little freaked out, not
to</b>
<br><b>mention being steamrolled by someone you can not see!!!! Please
write me</b>
<br><b>back with you ideas I am a little curious> Sorry to ramble but there
is</b>
<br><b>a lot of wierd things that have happened to us, these stories are
only a</b>
<br><b>few, I am just curious if the spirit likes us or is trying to get
rid of</b>
<br><b>us????</b><b></b>

<p><b>When I was about 5 years old we were at my grandmother house, This
house was</b>
<br><b>build by my grandfather (which I never meet him) this house gave
you the</b>
<br><b>feeling of someone was always watching you. None of the 3 bedrooms
had door</b>
<br><b>there were curtains put up for door, this was a very old wood house,
in some</b>
<br><b>of the rooms you could see threw the wood floor to the ouside,one
day my</b>

with</b>
<br><b>my sister who was 6 years old and the curtain was closed we all
heard some</b>
<br><b>one in the hall way walking , my mother called out (we knew know
one else was</b>
<br><b>in the house) my mother got scare which made us scare, she had a
glass of</b>
<br><b>water in her hand and when she though the person was coming in to
the bedroom</b>
<br><b>she threw the glass at this person (which we never saw but we all
felt it)</b>
<br><b>the glass stopped in mid air and flew back at my mother and hit
her in her</b>

<br><b>Various Strange Things:</b><b></b>

<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>One time my mom woke up at like 6:05am because she felt that someone</b>
<br><b>bear hugged her. It was so real it woke her up instantly. She found
out</b>
<br><b>later that day that her dad she hadnt seen in 10+ years had died
at</b>
<br><b>6:00am that day. Although she really never knew him well, she always</b>
<br><b>said she just wanted a hug from him. (That was said before he died).</b>
<br><b>Maybe that was the hug?</b>
<br><b>One time i was in the bathroom with no-one home. I heard something
hit</b>
<br><b>the door VERY hard as if it was a baseball. I shocked up instantly
in</b>
<br><b>fear. I stood there and waited for like 5 minutes before going out.
I</b>
<br><b>seen nothing laying on the floor and no explaination for the tremendous</b>
<br><b>bang. I rushed outside from fear and just sit out there. I then
began to</b>
<br><b>hear sounds as if the cabinets in the kitchen were slamming open
and</b>
<br><b>shut. I was puzzled at this point. After it stopped and i regained</b>
<br><b>courage i went in and never heard anything again.</b>
<br><b>(Newsflash) As i was typing this above the lights in my room flashed
on</b>
<br><b>and off like the power was going out, the net disconnected for a
minute</b>
<br><b>and the tv went off only in here and NOT the other room. Weird.
Ok back</b>
<br><b>to buesiness.</b>
<br><b>On time while lying awake in my dark room at night i heard a noise
as if</b>
<br><b>a bowling ball hit my floor. It scared me out of bed!</b>
<br><b>Once my widowed granny who also lives in an apt felt a cold wind
blow by</b>
<br><b>her while washing dishes late at night. She knows nothing about
ghost or</b>
<br><b>cold spots even to this day. The lady that lived there before her
had</b>
<br><b>died, also so thats some strange stuff...</b>
<br><b>(My house is not strange or nothing but my experiences you read
from</b>
<br><b>here are true even though this place isnt haunted).</b><b></b>

<p><b>Strange Horseman</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: "Albert Curtis"</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>As you will see I live in South Africa. About three weeks ago I was
travelling to Botswana along</b>
<br><b>a very unfrequented orad that I use because of the dealys at the
most frequented border post.</b>
<br><b>Far ahead of me I could see a man on a horse. As the road is untarred,
I could see the dust the</b>
<br><b>horse's hooves were making. I watched him for a long time. It is
not possible to drive fast on</b>
<br><b>that road, but when I was about a hundred feet from the man when
he just disappeared. This was</b>
<br><b>in broad daylight. I got out of the car and listened, but nothing.
On each side of the road low</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;bush, but nothing enough to hide a horse and rider.</b>
<br><b>Not my first experience of course. Before I came back to South Africa
I lived in a house in the</b>
<br><b>UK that was very definitely disturbed.</b><b></b>

<p><b>I have two experiences.&nbsp;&nbsp; The first happened when I was
having trouble in my</b>

I was asleep and</b>
<br><b>about 4:30 in the morning I was woken up by the touch of something
on my</b>
<br><b>shoulder.&nbsp; I looked up and there was a older woman standing
there.&nbsp; When I</b>
<br><b>looked again she was gone!&nbsp; Your going to be late for work
said a voice in</b>
<br><b>my ear.&nbsp; I&nbsp; told my boyfriend about it that night and
described the lady to him</b>
<br><b>and his eyes got wide and he said that was my mother, she has been
dead</b>
<br><b>for 3 years!&nbsp;&nbsp; I never married him and for good reason
but, that is a different</b>
<br><b>story.&nbsp;&nbsp; The second time I had and Experence was in 1995
I finally found the</b>
<br><b>man of my dreams and had married him in 1991, well we moved to another

<br><b>THE EDGEFIELD MANOR HAUNTINGS</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: DAllen1738@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hello, I'me writing about a few experiences i've had at my home.
The home is</b>
<br><b>called Edgefield Manor. First I want you to know this may sound
like the</b>
<br><b>classic haunting in a big old mansion, well believe me what lives
in this</b>
<br><b>house is no casper. I moved in in the Fall of 86'. The estate is
huge.</b>
<br><b>Gardens and rooms upon rooms. It was originally going to be condemned.
Well</b>
<br><b>anyway, heres a couple of my experiences. One day i was in one of
the</b>
<br><b>parlors, I got up to turn the light on, as soon as i did that and
turned</b>
<br><b>around, I saw a whitish figure glide across the other hallway. Onother
thing</b>
<br><b>is there is poltergeist activity. Explain this to me. The home has
a</b>
<br><b>ballroom, i went inside like usual, the grand piano was in the same
place as</b>
<br><b>its been when i moved in. I walked out for 5 minutes and then came
back</b>
<br><b>inside. The grand piano was moved across the floor. Pushed to the
other side</b>
<br><b>of the room. No indecation and no noise. It was just moved. There
are many</b>
<br><b>others, and i have pictures. If you want more stories or pictures
just EMail</b>
<br><b>me. Also if you use this one i sent EMail me also. Ill keep you
informed as</b>
<br><b>much as possible. Thank you.</b>

<br><b>Tower Maiden</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: puck@ezonline.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hi. My story begins in Maine. Our family owns a cottage in Castine.
We go</b>
<br><b>there every year. We are going next week actually. The house belonged
to my</b>
<br><b>great grandfather. The house dates back to Revolutionary war times.
People</b>
<br><b>have died on the front lawn. The house has a 3 floor tower. The
is a story</b>
<br><b>about a crazy lady who use to live in that house. She use scream
out of the</b>
<br><b>tower at people.</b>
<br><b>Well, I think I saw her in the tower one night. When my great grandfather</b>
<br><b>lived in the house he claimed that he saw it a few times when he
would read</b>
<br><b>on his rocking chair in the living room he said it would walk in
front of</b>
<br><b>him. 3 other people in my family saw the same thing. I never heard
the story</b>
<br><b>about the crazy lady until I brought up my experience to my parents
after we</b>
<br><b>got back from vacation. It was wearing a maidens outfit. When my
dad told my</b>
<br><b>grandfather he said that I had described it exactly as he saw it.
I have</b>
<br><b>never heard the story until I saw it. I am no lier.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Visitor</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: jschuh1@purdue.edu</b>
<br><b>A short but strange story.&nbsp; About five years ago, my uncle
was very sick,</b>
<br><b>quite literally on his death bed.&nbsp; My uncle spent the majority
of the day</b>
<br><b>sleeping, waking occasionally to see visitors or his wife who remained</b>
<br><b>constantly at his side.&nbsp; One day my uncle awoke suddenly and
told his wife</b>
<br><b>that he had just talked to Charlie and he had said that he (Charlie)
was</b>
<br><b>going to have a visitor soon.&nbsp; Charlie is my father, who had
been dead for</b>
<br><b>about 6 years at this time.&nbsp; Needless to say my uncles wife
was quite shaken</b>
<br><b>and naturally assumed the visitor would be her husband. However,
that day my</b>
<br><b>sister gave birth to a stillborn baby.&nbsp; The baby was put to
rest on my</b>
<br><b>father's grave.&nbsp; I guess it is only fitting.</b>
