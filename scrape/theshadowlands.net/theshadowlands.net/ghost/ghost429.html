Unseen Force<br>
<br>
By: tmassingill@hydro-tex.com <br>
<br>
I was reading though several stories today on your website and one in
particular sparked a memory of an experience I had when I was 8 months
pregnant with my daughter.&nbsp; I may have shared this story with you
once before, but I don&#8217;t remember.&nbsp; <br>
I remember that night just like it was yesterday.&nbsp; On evening in
early 1994, my husband and I were watching TV on the couch when I
decided to go to bed.&nbsp; I blew out a candle I had burning on the
kitchen table and then headed to the bedroom.&nbsp; It wasn&#8217;t too long
after I crawled into bed that I was abruptly taken over by this unseen
force sitting on my belly. My daughter began to move very violently and
I felt like I couldn&#8217;t breathe. I looked out my bedroom door and could
see this flickering light coming from the living room.&nbsp; I figured
my husband fell asleep on the couch and forgot to turn out the halogen
floor lamp we had sitting behind it. I began to scream as loud as I
could for him, but nothing came out my mouth.&nbsp; The harder I tried
to scream for help, the harder the unseen force seemed to push down on
me. I began to pray, I prayed like crazy, asking Jesus to protect me
and to protect my unborn child. I kept looking out the bedroom door,
seeing that flickering light and hoping to see my husband come running
in, but he never came.&nbsp; The whole incident lasted for what seemed
like forever, but when it was over, it was over just like that.&nbsp;
There was no more pain, I could breathe and my daughter was at
peace.&nbsp; <br>
That&#8217;s not the end of the story though. I got up from the bed and
headed to the living room to tell my husband what had happened.&nbsp;
No sooner then I left the bedroom, of course, I found him sleeping
soundly on the couch, but the halogen light behind it wasn&#8217;t on. The
flickering light I kept seeing throughout the ordeal was the candle on
the kitchen table.&nbsp; As explained in the beginning, I blew this
candle out before I went to bed and I know I did because I have always
been very cautious about burning candles. The candle had somehow
rekindled itself and burned all the way down to the wick. Apparently
the glass votive had gotten so hot that it broke and sent flames from
the wick onto the table and place mats.&nbsp;&nbsp; The entire top of
the table was on fire, placemats and all. I started screaming at my
husband to wake up.&nbsp; He jumped off the couch to find me trying to
smother the flames out with a kitchen towel. The apartment started to
quickly fill up with black smoke. He grabbed the fire extinguisher and
put the fire out.&nbsp; After it was all said and done, we talked about
what had just happened, trying to make some sense of it all. I was
certain the unseen force was trying to kill me and my baby. I thought
it was holding me down so that when the fire spread through the
apartment, I would die from smoke inhalation, or worse, burn to
death.&nbsp;&nbsp; My husband thought that whatever it was, it was
trying to warn me, that it was trying to wake me up so that I would
discover the fire.&nbsp; But I swear I was not asleep. At some point, I
thought maybe it was all just a bad dream, but then it dawned on me, if
it was just a dream, how was I able to see the flickering lights coming
from the living room, which turned to be flames?&nbsp;&nbsp; What I do
know is had I not gotten up when I did, it wouldn&#8217;t have been long
before the whole apartment would have been filled with smoke and fire
and we all would have all perished.&nbsp; Guardian Angel or evil
spirit?&nbsp; I guess I will never know.&nbsp; <br>

A Haunting in Southwestern Alaska<br>
<br>
By: andigirlk@hotmail.com<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; <br>
<br>
I was born and raised in Alaska. I come from a family that has a lot of
hidden psychic abilities.&nbsp; Ghosts and hauntings are nothing new or
strange to my family.&nbsp; I wanted to share my experiences while
growing up in Southwestern Alaska as a child.&nbsp; <br>
My father worked for the Federal Aviation Administration.&nbsp; My life
was similar to that of a military brat in some ways.&nbsp; I lived in
government housing which was located a ways out of our small
town.&nbsp; We ordered food and other items through commissary, and we
had free travel benefits if we chose to use the old F.A.A.&nbsp;
C-130.&nbsp;&nbsp; We lived away from the town and our neighborhood had
a feeling of being out in the middle of nowhere.&nbsp; <br>
When I was little we lived in a four-plex apartment building.&nbsp; Our
family was young and growing.&nbsp; My mother was so grateful when she
found out that after another family moved away, we would be moving into
their house.&nbsp; The F.A.A. housing in my neighborhood consisted
of:&nbsp; four-plex apartments, duplexes, and about seven single family
homes.&nbsp; The houses were originally across the river, and were used
by Air Force Officers and their families.&nbsp; The houses were a
simple Cape Cod, New England style house.&nbsp; <br>
Our old house was located in the middle of the compound.&nbsp; It was
build in 1931.&nbsp; We moved into the house during the 1970s; so the
house was only forty-five years old at the time.&nbsp; The house,
except for having changed locations, has retained its original
structure.&nbsp; The inside on the other hand, had underwent several
make-overs to keep up with the times.&nbsp; <br>
When we had moved into the house during the 1970s, the carpet on the
floor was a thick, multi-colored shag carpet.&nbsp; I didn't mind it so
much as a child; however, after looking at some old, family pictures, I
realized how awful that old carpet was with the colors of:&nbsp;
harvest gold, burnt orange, and brown.&nbsp;&nbsp; The living room
walls were a light, harvest gold, and the furniture was in shades
of:&nbsp; gold, burnt orange, and brown.&nbsp; It truly looked like a
hangover from the late 1960s and early 1970s.&nbsp;&nbsp; It would
nauseate many people now; however, my mother claims that it was very
vogue at the time.&nbsp; <br>
There were three children in our family, one boy, and two girls.&nbsp;
It's very ironic that the last family to live in that house had three
children, one boy, and two girls as well.&nbsp; The house had four
bedrooms;&nbsp; two downstairs, and two that were located upstairs in
the attic.&nbsp; My parents took a downstairs bedroom, as did my
brother.&nbsp; My sister and I took the bedroom on the left side of the
attic.&nbsp; My mother wanted to the use fourth bedroom as a sewing
room, and for additional storage.&nbsp; <br>
My sister and I liked our room at first.&nbsp; It had a very cool
closet that we used as a play house.&nbsp; There was one feature that
really creeped my sister and me out.&nbsp; It was the removable storage
walls that were covering small parts of the eves.&nbsp; Since we were
in the attic, just under the roof; the storage area was just under the
eves.&nbsp; When the doors were in place, you couldn't really tell that
the storage area was there.&nbsp; If my mom or dad had to get something
out of the storage and left the small doors ajar,&nbsp; the crack of
mysterious darkness left a creepy vibe throughout the room.&nbsp; My
mom had used the storage on the west side of the attic for holiday
decorations (Halloween, etc.).&nbsp; The storage on the east side of
the attic was used for our food storage.&nbsp; Mom kept non-perishable
items there like:&nbsp; canned goods, ketchup, condiments, rice, taco
shells, paper towels, and the like.&nbsp;&nbsp; Each of us kids dreaded
having to open the creepy storage area to fetch things for mom.&nbsp;
It was so dark, that we needed a flashlight to fetch the requested
item(s). <br>
From a young age, I loved Halloween and would look forward to this
spooky holiday.&nbsp; I think even at a young age, I would occasionally
love a good scare.&nbsp; When I was only five years old, I begged my
mother for the record, "The Haunted Mansion" put out by Walt
Disney.&nbsp; For those of you unfamiliar with this, it was a record
that Disney created to tell the story of the, "Haunted Mansion."&nbsp;
It was based on the popular ride that is located in both Disneyland and
Disney World.&nbsp; The story isn't too spooky; however, the other side
had some sound effects that were quite terrifying to me as a
child.&nbsp; It included the typical stereotypical sounds of a haunted
house:&nbsp; ghosts moaning, chains rattling, cats fighting, and awful
blood curdling screams.&nbsp; I did not like that side of the
record.&nbsp; A neighbor girl, my sister, and I used to like to scare
ourselves by listening to that side.&nbsp; Occasionally we'd really get
brave and turn the lights out.&nbsp; I usually ended up crying at
night, telling my mom that I was scared.&nbsp; She knew what I was
doing and would tell me that it was just a record, and that if it
bothered me so much, she would start hiding it from me.&nbsp; <br>
The record was put away and forgotten for a while; however, things
started happening when I was around six years-old.&nbsp; My brother who
has always been incredibly sensitive towards things started to see
things in the house.&nbsp; He had the larger room that was across from
my parent's room.&nbsp; My sister and I were by ourselves in the
attic.&nbsp; My brother said that he saw an evil looking man that was
dressed in a black cloak.&nbsp; He was a tall, harrowing looking
man.&nbsp; He would visit my brother's room and other parts of the
house.&nbsp; When my brother mentioned this to our parents, they
dismissed it as his imagination, or that it was just a dream.&nbsp; My
brother began to hate the house, and my sister and I began to get the
creeps as well.&nbsp; <br>
My sister and I were glad to share a room together, because the room on
the right side of the attic; the one that was used as a sewing
room/hobby room, gave both of us the creeps.&nbsp; Neither of us could
explain why, it just did.&nbsp; We were more comfortable with our room;
however, it was always cold.&nbsp; My mother would bundle us up with
quilts, especially during the winter.&nbsp; We both got scared from the
noises we heard at night.&nbsp; They were pretty non-descript at
first.&nbsp; Our parents said that because the house was older, we were
probably hearing the settling, or the furnace. There were other times
when my sister and I would hear the stairway creaking and footfalls,
long after everybody else had been asleep.&nbsp;&nbsp; We were in the
attic, so the creaking stairway was even more creepy to us.&nbsp; We
learned to sleep with a night light on.&nbsp; I took things a step
further.&nbsp; I refused to fall asleep facing the wall.&nbsp; I wanted
to be able to see the doorway.&nbsp; I would never walk up to my
bed.&nbsp; I always stood a ways from the bed and jumped in.&nbsp; I
didn't want anything to touch my feet.&nbsp; There were times when my
sister and I were so scared that we used to sleep together in one bed. <br>
I remember looking forward to my first book order at school.&nbsp; I
told my mom that I wanted the book and record set about Georgie, the
friendly little New England Ghost that lived in the Whittaker's
attic.&nbsp; Even though, I was scared of ghosts, I felt strangely
drawn to the book.&nbsp; I loved my book and record set.&nbsp; I
remember telling my mom that my room was in the attic.&nbsp; The other
side of the record contained poems and songs that were entitled,
"Mother Ghost and Other Nursery Rhymes."&nbsp; My sister and I both
enjoyed that record; however, there were a couple of rhymes and stories
that bothered us, mainly my sister.&nbsp; The first was the poem, "A
Goblin Lives in Our House," and the other was the story, "In a Dark,
Dark Wood."&nbsp; My sister and I both agreed that, "A Goblin. . ."
reminded us of our house.&nbsp; We didn't like the man screaming at the
end of, "In a Dark, Dark Wood."&nbsp; Once again, the book and record
became old news and we moved onto other things.&nbsp; <br>
Something really strange started happening when I was six and seven
years old.&nbsp; Records were still very popular in the 1970s.&nbsp; I
found some of my parents' old 45s.&nbsp; I started listening to songs
that were popular during the early late 50s and early 60s.&nbsp; We had
a burnt orange swivel chair in our house.&nbsp; Out of nowhere, I
started envisioning a strange middle-aged couple in my mind.&nbsp; I
know I didn't see a vision; however, the impressions that I received in
my mind were very real.&nbsp; The mental visions would start when I
would descend down the attic stairs.&nbsp; The staircase overlooked our
living room, and the orange swivel chair was in clear view.&nbsp; On my
way downstairs, I would look over at the chair and envision this
couple.&nbsp; The man was heavy set with a belly.&nbsp; He was bald in
the middle and had light brown/gray hair on the sides.&nbsp; The woman
was quite plump, and had red hair that she wore up.&nbsp; She had a
long straight nose, but was otherwise quite attractive for a plump,
middle-aged woman.&nbsp;&nbsp; As the days progressed, and I continued
to envision this couple on our orange swivel chair; the names Hughbert
and Helen came to my mind.&nbsp; I have a cousin named Helen, but other
than that, I didn't know anybody with those names.&nbsp; <br>
Hughbert and Helen began to take on a life of their own.&nbsp; Each
time when I would look at that orange chair, I would catch them in a
different mood.&nbsp; Their countenances would literally change.&nbsp;
Sometimes they would look happy.&nbsp; I would occasionally envision
them hugging each other.&nbsp; Other times they looked sick (almost
yellow or light greenish), or sad.&nbsp; The scariest of all was when
they would look angry, or enraged.&nbsp; The look on their faces was
quite scary.&nbsp; I knew it was all in my mind; however, even at the
young age of seven, I would wonder why these people would pop into my
mind.&nbsp; It always occurred when I was climbing up or down the
stairs that led to the attic, and while I looked at the orange
chair.&nbsp; As these strange mental occurrences popped into my head, I
mentally gave them children.&nbsp; I thought that they had four
children, two boys and two girls.&nbsp; I got the distinct feeling that
something awful happened to one of the children, a daughter.&nbsp; I
also felt that the daughter was a teenager when that tragic event
happened.&nbsp; <br>
While I was having these mental dramas, that occurred without
explanation, my sister was having troubles of her own.&nbsp; She
started seeing a little girl.&nbsp; The little girl was blond and had
appeared to be in black and white.&nbsp;&nbsp; The thing that scared my
sister the most happened in the middle of the night.&nbsp; She was
restless and woke up.&nbsp; She looked over to the east side of the
room where I was sound asleep.&nbsp; She claims that she saw my spirit
sitting on top of my body.&nbsp; This really bothered my sister and she
told my parents about the experience.&nbsp; Again, our parents
dismissed this as the product of imagination, or a dream.&nbsp; My
brother and I believed my sister.&nbsp;&nbsp; My brother continued to
see the evil man that was dressed in black.&nbsp; <br>
In the late 1970s my mother woke up from a horrifying dream.&nbsp; She
told us that she was laying in bed with the feeling that she was being
watched.&nbsp; When she looked up there was this man dressed in black,
who was standing by her closet just leering at her.&nbsp; Although he
didn't say anything, he appeared to be menacing.&nbsp; My mom said she
was upset with my father, and was wondering why he let this strange man
into our home.&nbsp; After that, mom said she woke up.&nbsp; My brother
and I to this day believe that it wasn't a dream.&nbsp; We both believe
that our mom saw the same man that my brother would see throughout the
house. <br>
My mother decided to go back to work in 1979.&nbsp; She hired her
cousin, a kindly, older woman, who had never been married or had any
children of her own.&nbsp; Marie was truly a nice woman.&nbsp; She was
devout in her Russian Orthodox faith, and lived a village that was
located only about ten miles away from our town.&nbsp; Marie was kind
to us children and we really liked her.&nbsp; Marie lived with us
during the week.&nbsp; She was in charge of looking after us children
during breaks, after school, and housekeeping.&nbsp; Her room was the
creepy room on the right side of the attic.&nbsp;&nbsp; Marie never
mentioned any creepy experiences to us; however, she seemed more than
anxious to return to her village for the weekend.&nbsp; My sister and I
decided to snoop around in her room one day.&nbsp; We discovered some
Russian Orthodox icons that were discreetly placed on a small
shelf.&nbsp; Maybe Marie knew what us children had been experiencing in
that house. <br>
While growing up, my family had many happy times in that house.&nbsp;
During the day time, the house had a friendly, loving feeling to
it.&nbsp; However, sometimes in the evenings, and at night, it seemed
to take on a more creepy, even rarely a sinister personality.&nbsp;
During our family get-togethers, my brother, sister, and I frequently
mention our experiences in that house.&nbsp; The majority of our
memories were good.&nbsp; We all agreed that there were many times in
which we felt uncomfortable in that house.&nbsp; <br>
My mother has always loved to celebrate the various holidays; Halloween
was no exception.&nbsp; I still remember the year when my mother
invited several of our childhood friends over for a Halloween
party.&nbsp; We were all having fun when my mom suggested a game of
hide and seek in the dark.&nbsp; At first it sounded like a good idea;
however, I ended up being the one that was it.&nbsp; I remember getting
the chills when I groped around the dark house looking for my family
and friends.&nbsp; It turned out that they were hiding in the laundry
room together.&nbsp; I almost started crying when they jumped out and
scared me.&nbsp; I didn't like that game.&nbsp; When I was a pre-teen
and teenager, my mom used to let me have slumber parties.&nbsp; My
friends all loved my house, and would look forward to staying the
night.&nbsp; They always wanted to tell ghosts stories.&nbsp; I didn't
mind ghost stories; however, none of my friends knew what I went
through in that house.&nbsp; I'm sure if I had shared some of my
stories, they would have thought I was lying, exaggerating, or
crazy.&nbsp; I also didn't want to scare them away.&nbsp; I wanted to
keep my friends, and to have them come over and visit.&nbsp; Alas, I
just listened to the ghost stories, and tried my best not to think
about them after the slumber party was over. <br>
I grew up in a nice, Christian family.&nbsp; I believe that because of
this, I found it hard to believe that my family could fall victim to a
haunting.&nbsp; We prayed and put our faith in the Lord, so being
interrupted with dark images and terrifying feelings seemed out of
place.&nbsp; I now believe that my family, particularly the children,
have been blessed with the ability to see and interact with the Spirit
World.&nbsp; From a Christian point of view, I believe that God doesn't
give us anything or any situation that you can't handle.&nbsp; I know
that the Lord felt that we could handle the situation.&nbsp;&nbsp; We
continued to love, help, and work together as a family.&nbsp; We didn't
lose our faith, or let the spooky things that went bump in the night
challenge our spirituality.&nbsp; If anything, our faith in God, the
plan of happiness, and life after death has grown stronger.&nbsp; I
believe in several types of spirits;&nbsp; angels (the benevolent,
loving spirits), lost spirits (those that find it hard to progress
beyond this world of cares), and demons (those evil spirits that have
never had a body).&nbsp; I believe that my family has witnessed and
interacted with all three kinds.&nbsp; I also believe that ghosts
(spirits) are nothing to fear.&nbsp; The good ones are there to help
you; the lost ones may need your help; and the evil ones need to be
cast out.&nbsp; <br>
My only regret is not fully understanding the situation that we were
in.&nbsp; I still wonder if there really was a Hughbert and
Helen.&nbsp; Why was I able to envision them and their family?&nbsp;
Believe me, those are not typical thoughts of a six and seven
year-old.&nbsp; Who or what was the dark man?&nbsp; What about the
little girl?&nbsp; I may never know the history of the house, land, or
its previous occupants.&nbsp; We moved away from the small town years
ago.&nbsp; We all have families of our own.&nbsp; With the exception of
my sister, we all live in the same city. The Federal Aviation
Administration auctioned off those old houses, and have since built
nice, new, modern housing.&nbsp; My dad claims that the houses sold for
a very reasonable prices.&nbsp; I often wonder who bought our old
house, and if they have experienced our ghosts.&nbsp; My hope is that
if those spirits were restless or ill-at-ease, that they've found the
guidance and help that they need.&nbsp; I hope they moved on to
paradise.&nbsp; <br>
Late last summer, my husband and I moved to an older, established
neighborhood in our city.&nbsp; Our house is located along a creek and
has many nice features to it.&nbsp;&nbsp; My husband and I were both
drawn to it from the beginning.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is only forty years-old,
and the people who have lived in it before us, said they were quite
comfortable here. They lived in the house for twenty-five
years.&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon moving in, we had a problem with flies, and
soon discovered that our home was haunted.&nbsp; My brother who is a
seer, claimed that we had five or six ghosts.&nbsp; Our home was
blessed and it's been comfortable ever since.&nbsp; If we do have any
spirits lurking around, I'm sure they are of those beloved deceased
members of our families.&nbsp; Who knows maybe experiences in our home
will lead to another
story.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>

I am a former resident of West Greenwich,Rhode Island.<br>
In my teenage years,I would spend a great deal of time at Carr's
Pond.My friends and I would camp,swim,and hang out there on a regular
basis.One time,I was alone.I was walking my dog down a path to the pump
house.Along the way,my dog strated acting up.She was walking behind me
and kept whining.I turned around and there was a teenage boy standing
behind me.His hair was brown and his chlothes were tattered and he
looked wet.He stared at me with a cold strae.I looked at him and I
turned the other way for a split second.I turned back and he disappered
into thin air.I hid behind a rock and then went running back though the
paths and I have never went back since.It has haunted me for many years
and I believe I saw a ghost that day.I later learned that a teenage
boy,fitting the description,had drowned in the pond a few years earlier.<br>

My First Paranormal Experience<br>
<br>
By: monismile87@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
<br>
i must have been around 8 or 9 years old when my first paranormal
experince began.&nbsp; My sister, brother, my grandma and I all slept
in one room, (different beds of course).&nbsp; It was a normal night
and I just fell asleep like always.&nbsp; Hours later I woke up for no
reason and saw a person sitting in my grandma's bed.&nbsp; i tought it
was my grandma praying since she would always pray (very catholic
lady), but then I started to realise that my grandma was
sleeping.&nbsp; I just stared at whatever that thing was and noticed it
was looking right at me.&nbsp; I know for a fact that it was woman
because she had long hair and the body of a woman.&nbsp; but her face
was burned and disfigured.&nbsp; The only thing i did was just stared
at her, she sudenly got up and kneeled down next to me. Eventually I
feel asleep again.&nbsp; I woke up what seemed minutes later to find
out that I was somehow on the other side of the bed, how did i move
without standing up I had no idea, I tilted my head up a little so i
could see what time it was when i saw that same lady right next to my
head stroking my hair!!!&nbsp; As disturbing as it may sound I was not
scared so I feel asleep for the last time.&nbsp; I woke up the next
morning and asked everybody if they were in the room last night, then i
asked my grandma if she had been praying that night, everybody
including my grandma said no.&nbsp; That was the last time I ever saw
that lady but from that day on almost all of my relatives that lived in
that house have seen the same woman I have, only difference, they have
been scared right out of their pants.<br>

Not My Son <br>
<br>
By:&nbsp; tmassingill@hydro-tex.com<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<br>
One night many years back, I was sleeping in my bed, when I was awaken
by what sounded like little footsteps moving across the living room
floor.&nbsp; The house was pitch dark, but when I looked in the doorway
there was moonlight shining through the window in the living room, so I
was able to see that there was a figure of a small child standing in
the doorway looking into my room.&nbsp; Assuming it was my son, I
quietly asked him what was the matter and if he had a nightmare, there
was no answer.&nbsp; I asked again and still no answer. Still thinking
it was my son, I figured that he was just sleep walking so I got out of
bed and headed towards the door to pick him up and return him to his
room.&nbsp; When I reached the door, the little figure just
disappeared. I quickly went into my son&#8217;s room, and there he was, all
tucked in and sleeping soundly.&nbsp; It didn&#8217;t look like he had moved
an inch in his bed.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know what I was thinking, but I was
trying to figure out a logical explanation.&nbsp; But I kept coming
back to the conclusion that I must have seen a ghost. It couldn&#8217;t have
been my son, there was no way he could walk, must less run from my
doorway to his bedroom and me not see him.&nbsp; After that night, I
had a strange feeling like someone was watching and following me around
the house.&nbsp; I would even close my bedroom door only to wake the
following morning and find it open.&nbsp; I asked my son and husband on
many occasions if they had opened the door in the middle of the night
and every time they both answered no.&nbsp; I never saw the ghost child
again, but as long as I lived in that house, I always felt that he was
there with me.&nbsp;&nbsp; I learned through my neighbor that several
years before we moved in that a young boy who lived close by was riding
his bike in the street in front of our house and was hit by a car, the
driver got out, picked him u, sat down in my front yard and held him
until the paramedics got there.&nbsp; He died in her arms before they
arrived.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>

Apartment Haunting Norfolk VA<br>
<br>
By: sammniamii@hotmail.com <br>
<br>
Hello. Last year I sent in a story about my boyfriend Mother&#8217;s house
and the events that chased me away from there. Now I&#8217;m writing in with
a new set of events from my new apt. Just under 2 years ago we moved
from one old building to another old building about 2 miles away. My
end of town is old; the Oceanview section of Norfolk, VA. Many places
down here are 50-100+ years old, the area is full of history, some of
it dark and unsettling.<br>
From the very first second I walked into the new place, I knew it was
an old school. Later I found out, yes in fact is was the Old Oceanview
Elementary that had been replaced sometime in the 1940&#8217;s. Since the
beginning, I knew something "else" was in the building. Within the
first week of moving in, I sat alone in the living room and heard the
sound of children laughing, from directly in front of me in the middle
of my living room. I still am not sure if it was from outside, upstairs
or what, but it was slightly alarming. A friend who visited shortly
after also reported she felt a child grab her hand as she walked into
the apt.<br>
A few months later, I was home alone again, but getting ready to head
out. Allow me to give you a bit of a layout. The apt is laid out in an
H shape, with a long living room space, which leads thru an archway
into the kitchen/hallway area. That narrows down to a hallway with a
pantry on the left and the bathroom on the right just before the
bedroom door. The bedroom, 12x14, is isolated from the rest of the
place. You cannot hear anyone knocking on the front door from the
bedroom. The building is made of brick, concrete, with plaster walls
and a wooden raised floor. Technically the ground floor is below ground
level. Anyways back to the story.<br>
I was in the bathroom, just getting out of the shower. I had the
bathroom door wide open, it blocks the hallway otherwise, and in the
kitchen/hall section was a large dresser w/ a 45 gallon fish tank. In
the reflection of the tank you could see into the kitchen. As I flipped
my head down to wrap my hair, I looked into the fish tank and saw a
tall male standing in the kitchen. I quickly stood up and ran out,
checking the kitchen &#8211; no one but the cat and me were the only ones in
the place. I went back to the bathroom to see if I could figure it out
&#8211; I never could.<br>
Several more months later, my boyfriend, myself and the cat were in the
living area end of the apt. All the lights were off in the other end
and everybody, including the cat, was off the floor or sitting down.
Suddenly I heard a noise from the other end of the apt like the sound
of a foot dragging across the carpeted floor. I looked at my boyfriend
who was looking at me &#8211; neither of us knew what made that sound. The
cat acted off all evening, following us closely.<br>
Two days later, the sound repeated but this time we; BF, myself and
cat, were in the bedroom and off the floor, the other end of the apt
was dark and sealed up. Again the foot scraping the carpet sound, as
clear as day.<br>
About this time we started leaving a light on in the front part of the
apt at night &#8211; we are both grown adults, 27 and 31, but something gave
us the creeps: the archway leading between the two sections of the apt.
If you sat in the bedroom and the living room was dark, you will get
completely un-nerved looking into the darkness of the archway. Myself,
my boyfriend and several friends all felt this. If you sat in the
living room and looked into the bedroom, you didn&#8217;t feel anything. Also
at this time, my boyfriend and myself started getting strange &#8220;I&#8217;m not
alone&#8221; feelings if you were in the bedroom but alone in the house.
Several times I would get up and go looking into the living room to see
if my boyfriend had come home only to find the place locked up and
empty. He would do the same if he was home alone.<br>
The last two major items are creepy. First, as I explained before, if
the bathroom door is open, but not wide open, it blocks the hallway.
One night my boyfriend was using the loo and I was in the bedroom with
my cat, watching TV. I got up, turned off the TV and left the room,
closing the bathroom door just enough to get by. My cat was right on my
heels. We sat down and started watching TV in the living room. A few
minutes later my boyfriend joins us and asked me if I passed by twice.
&#8220;No, why?&#8221; He stated that just before I walked by the door, out of the
corner of his eye he saw a pale female leg pass by the door. I told him
that I would have had to move the door to pass, plus the cat was with
me and if I passed twice, he would have seen me 3 times, not just
twice. He doesn&#8217;t know what he saw that night.<br>
Last major thing was the very next night. He was in the bathroom
shaving and I was standing the in the hallway, with the door open,
blocking the hallway. I was talking to him and out of the corner of the
my eye, I saw a pale white, sharp clawed female hand wrap around the
doorknob then pull back around. I stopped in mid-word and the boyfriend
asked what I saw. I told him and he looked past the door &#8211; nothing
there.<br>
Since then I have done a full-blown ritual cleansing on the apt. That
very day the place felt better and all the weirdness stopped: no
sounds, no shadows or shapes, no major creepy feeling from the archway.
BUT&#8230; only within the last few months has some strange things started up
again&#8230; mainly misty shapes out of the corner of my eyes. I guess it&#8217;s
time for another cleansing. Thanks for the time to tell my tale, sorry
it was long, but it had to be just to get out. Thanks and keep up all
the good work on the site.<br>

The Read House of Chattanooga, TN<br>
<br>
By: speedy9747@aol.com<br>
A great addition to your haunted places index<br>
The modern day Sheraton Read House, which sits in downtown Chattanooga,
Tennessee, was originally opened in 1847 as the Crutchfield House. The
Crutchfield House was a family owned business profiting on the booming
railroad industry coming from the "Gateway to the South" the
Chattanooga train depot. By the time of the Civil War, the Crutchfield
family had divided loyalties and the hotel was sold shortly before the
war. When fighting swept into Chattanooga in 1863, the hotel was
commandeered by the Union forces and converted it into a hospital. <br>
Legend has it that room 311 is haunted by the a murdered prostitute. A
Union Soldier, most likely wounded in battle, enlisted the
companionship of a "working girl." Apparently, all did not go well. No
one can say with any certainty what happened other than the girl was
brutally murdered.&nbsp; Since the hotel was under the control of the
Union Forces and the victim was most likely a Southern sympathizer, the
soldier it is doubtful that he was ever punished for his crimes.&nbsp; <br>
Ironically, the hotel survived the brutal war only to burn to the
ground in 1867. A doctor, John T. Read, persuaded T.G. Montague and
other investors to build a replacement hotel on the site of the
Crutchfield House in 1872. And it has been suggested that once the
hotel was rebuilt, the prostitute returned to the very room where held
her last breath in an effort to avenge her death-or perhaps she never
left. <br>
Even today, visitors and staff have seen bizarre apparitions or have
heard unexplainable sounds coming from room 311. On more than one
occasion, hotels guests have left in the middle of the night, too
frightened to stay in the room any longer. Staff members have been
confronted with firing and have still refused to go in room 311. Since
the reopening of the hotel in 1872, the reports have been so frequent
that it has become company policy to not use that room unless no others
are available,or it is requested. <br>

<br>
By: yvonne_t69@yahoo.com <br>
<br>
When I moved to Virginia my first job was working in a baptist church in Yorktown<br>
my coworkers would tell me to visit the battle field it was a nice place to visit. one day I decided to go <br>
on my lunch break I would go for an hour it was only 3 min. away I started<br>
driving along the main road entering the entrance of the beach when all
of a sudden the gages in my car started spinning around and around I
didn't not think it had anything to do with the surrounding because I
was driving a old car the further I<br>
enter the beach area the car would pull to my left towards the bridge
and water making it difficult to drive I finally came to a parking lot
and turned around<br>
going back to work this hole time it felt like 20 min went by my watch<br>
had stopped and the car dash board clock was not working when I finally got closer<br>
to my job the gages went back to normal and my watch said 2 o'clock
when I left at 11:45am it felt like I enter a different zone I did not
mention anything to my coworkers I ended up going to work 2 hours late
back from lunch. I decided to go to Yorktown for lunch again and the
same thing happened.<br>

Gertie the Ghost pays a visit!<br>
<br>
By:&nbsp; Anonymous<br>
<br>
I attended Harding University in Searcy, Arkansas not too long
ago.&nbsp; During my senior year, I stayed a few months in a private
dorm in the Patti Cobb girl dormitories.&nbsp; <br>
Many people say that various parts of Harding campus are haunted by the
ghost of Gertie - a girl who died by falling from a bell tower on
campus back in the early 1900s.&nbsp; She has been known to haunt the
old music building, the brick pathway that cuts across campus, and the
bell tower (which has since been detached and placed on campus as a
landmark).&nbsp;&nbsp; One other thing she is said to haunt happens to
be the Patti Cobb dormitories.&nbsp; There is debate as to whether or
not it's Gertie or a different ghost entirely, but either way one thing
is for certain - Patti Cobb is haunted.<br>
I had heard about this prior to moving into the Patti Cobb dorms, but I
was told a different story about how she only haunted the first floor
dorms.&nbsp; I was given a dorm on the third floor.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was
a private dorm that had no connecting suits to it.&nbsp; I had my own
private bathroom and the room was not shared with a roommate.<br>
At first I was thrilled with not having to share a bathroom with
anyone.&nbsp; Then I started having strange feelings at night.&nbsp; I
would find that I would hear noises in the hallway at times.&nbsp; Of
course, being a dorm, I passed it off as silly girls wandering the
hallways at night.&nbsp; No biggie.<br>
But then I started having strange feelings in my room.&nbsp; There were
times I would feel as though someone was sitting at the edge of my
bed.&nbsp; Sometimes I felt as though someone was standing there
starring at me.&nbsp;&nbsp; The doorknob would also jiggle at various
points during the night.&nbsp; I normally tried to ignore it, thinking
maybe it was an RA doing nightly dorm checks (the university has a
strict curfew), but there would be times that it would happen at 3 in
the morning when any sane person would already be out of the hallways
and in bed!&nbsp;&nbsp; The few times I opened the door upon hearing it
jiggling, there would be nobody in the hallway.<br>
Eventually I moved out of that room and moved in with a girl a few
doors down.&nbsp; While I still could hear the occasional freaky noises
in the hallway at early morning hours, the feeling of something
un-natural being in the room and the doorknob jiggling ceased in my new
dorm.&nbsp;&nbsp; I found out later from an older friend of mine,
however, that she had lived in the exact same dorm room that I had
scary issues in.&nbsp;&nbsp; When she lived in there a few years
earlier, she and a friend of hers were sitting around
talking.&nbsp;&nbsp; She was sitting at her desk and felt someone hug
her.&nbsp; She turned around to see her friend starring at her with
wide eyes.&nbsp; "What happened?" she asked.&nbsp; "I just saw a ghost
behind you!" her friend replied.<br>
To this day she swears up and down that Gertie gave her a hug in her
dorm room - the exact same dorm room that I had so many freaky
encounters in.&nbsp; <br>
And people wonder why I get paranoid being alone in a house at night.<br>

Ghost Story from a Friend<br>
<br>
By: Anonymous<br>
<br>
A close friend of mine had an interesting experience I thought I'd
share.&nbsp;&nbsp; She used to live in this old house located in
central Arkansas.&nbsp; It's been abandoned for years, but her
grandparents still own the property it stands on.&nbsp;&nbsp; I
remember going over there to help her and her mother move stuff out of
the house.&nbsp; It was really old and falling apart.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
entire place just had a major creepy feeling to it.&nbsp; <br>
She mentioned to me while over there that as a child, she remembers
having an experience with the ghost of a little girl that dwelt
there.&nbsp;&nbsp; There were several things that she mentioned about
the girl, but the one I remember in detail is one incident when my
friend was very young.&nbsp;&nbsp; Her mom had just tucked her in to
bed and was turning off the light.&nbsp;&nbsp; A few minutes later, the
light switch flicked on by itself.&nbsp;&nbsp; My friend screamed for
her mom to come.&nbsp;&nbsp; Her mom turned the light off again, only
for it to be physically flicked back on.&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally the mother
said very sternly, "Please stop that and let my daughter sleep." to the
ghost there.&nbsp;&nbsp; The light did not come back on afterwards. <br>
My friend updated me on the ghost a few weeks ago.&nbsp; Apparently her
grandparents finally decided to tear down the old, ragged house that
once stood there and make good use of the land.&nbsp;&nbsp; After the
house was destroyed, the little girl apparently made her way to the
grandparents' house!&nbsp;&nbsp; My friends' grandmother has noted
seeing a little girl running around the house out of the corner of her
eye.&nbsp;&nbsp; She does not believe that the ghost is malicious, so
she doesn't mind it so much, but she has no doubt in her mind that it's
the same ghost girl from the house that they used to live in.&nbsp; <br>

My Visit to 13 Stairs<br>
<br>
By: wrennad@aol.com<br>
&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Earlier this night I was rehashing past visits to a cemetery in my
hometown of Naugatuck Ct, called Guntown when I remembered a visit to
Iowa when I was 17, so back in 2000.<br>
I went to visit a friend and spent only a few days. My friend, having
been to "13 Stairs" ( I just recently found out it's real name,
Pleasant Ridge) many times told me about it and we decided to make a
trip of it. There were four of us in total. Three teens and an adult.
My friend told me the stories about bodies being buried in the steps,
about the graves being mostly young children, about possible Satanist
activities and the like before we arrived, so I was prepared. <br>
We left a little after 11:30pm, arrived there shortly after midnight
without any problems finding it. I think there was a gate but it was
open. We parked a few feet from the steps, with the car facing them.
The moon was out but it was still fairly dark so we brought
flashlights. We went to check it out only, to look around some and take
some photographs. <br>
It was around winter so it was cold and windy. We were the only ones
there, no other cars in sight at least. We made our way up the stairs
and into the cemetery. It was eerie. I kept getting those deep chills
up and down my spine that kind of make your body jerk and a definite
feeling of being watched. I know my friends complained of the same and
wanted to leave minutes after arriving. <br>
One claimed to have heard their name being called and being touched,
like someone was tugging on their clothing and seeing shadows move
around the tombstones. I didn't experience any of that myself but I was
weirded out all the same. We walked around a bit, not too far from the
stairs themselves and took some photos of the graves. After about 30
minutes, and it being well after midnight, the others were ready to
leave. This is where the freaky thing happened. <br>
To our knowledge we were the only ones there. There weren't any other
cars visible nor people. After having a somewhat disappointed time, in
my opinion, we made our way down the steps and toward the car. We had
the flashlight on by then and lighting our way when my friend saw
something black on the ground. We rush back to the car and turned the
headlights on and right at the bottom of the steps in the parking lot
was a huge Pentacle traced out in what looked like black paint.<br>
I know it wasn't there before we climbed the steps. The car was parked
so the headlights would light up the bottom of the steps so we could
see them. There was nothing on the ground beforehand. By then my
friends were screaming and crying and pulling me in to the car. I
snapped a photo or two and then we sped off. I do recall the car
stalling once before we left.<br>
I waited until I got back home to develop the film, only to be told
that there was nothing at all on the roll. It was a roll of 24, all of
which were of the cemetery and the roll was completely blank. That
irked me. <br>
The Pentacle thing was crazy. Were weren't drunk or high or anything
stupid like that and I know the 4 of us couldn't have imagined it and
it definitely was not there when we first arrived. I'm not saying
ghosts did it either. For all I know, there could have been some kids
there already and decided to mess with us. I heard it gets vandalized a
lot. <br>
It's just what we experienced that night. And my friends who are from
that area were horrified for a few days about what happened and
mentioned some rubbish about going to hell. <br>
&nbsp;It's a little hard to believe and I wouldn't have either if I
wasn't there but I thought it was interesting and felt like sharing.
I'd love to go back one day. I'm not sure if this is a haunting or
anything. More of a strange happening at a haunted place. Anyway,
thanks for listening. I wonder if anyone else ever experienced that? I
thought it was strange.<br>

I Told You So!<br>
<br>
By: karendawson_36@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
These aren't ghost stories, they are more outer body paranormal
experiences.&nbsp; I do have witnesses to them.&nbsp; Back in 1994 I
was stationed at Kadena AFB Okinawa Japan.&nbsp; I was sleeping one
night and had a dream I can remember to this day.&nbsp; I was standing
on the the porch of an older black mans house with the view of some
mountains behind him.&nbsp; I saw a blast of light from an explosion
coming from the mountains, all of a sudden a train that was filled with
women and children that had been blown up came out of the mountains and
through the old mans house.&nbsp; In my dream there were dead bodies
all in the back yard, in trees and on the ground.&nbsp; I woke up
horrified wondering to my self why I would dream such a thing, I told
my friend about the dream and both of us wondered why.&nbsp; The next
day when I got to work I started reading the newspaper and front page
news in Egypt a train carrying mostly women and children exploded while
coming out of the mountains and went through an older Gentlemans
house.&nbsp; They didn't know where the bodies were.&nbsp; I stopped
breathing as I read this story, this scared me as I had never
experienced any ESP this powerful, I have feelings sometimes, or
can&nbsp; sometimestell what someone is thinking, but this blew me and
my friend away. I could not have heard about this a head of time as we
were on a small Japanes Island with no cable tv at the time just AFRTS
the military channel. <br>
The Second big experience happend in 1998, i had come back to Cheyenne
Wyoming after 4 years on Okinawa.&nbsp; My father moved out there with
me to watch my daughter as I was going back out to the missile
sites.&nbsp; We had been there for a week and just moved into a trailer
so we had no cable hooked up and had to watch movies.&nbsp; One night I
dreamed I was in California and there was a massive mud slide, I told
my father of the dream the next day.&nbsp; We thought nothing of it
until the next day his brother Cliff called us and told my dad that the
Pacific Palisades in Santa Monica California where my dad lived for 28
years slid down into the ocean.&nbsp; A massive mud slide of course, my
dad looked at me right away and told me what Cliff had said, all I
could say was "I told you so".<br>

Experiences of a Lifetime<br>
<br>
By: dspig@ptd.net<br>
<br>
I have a sister Janette who has dealt with paranormal experiences over
her life; she sent this site to me via email. I inturn thought that I
would share my feelings and some of my encounters with you. <br>
Some of the stories that I read from your site were very convincing
while others sounded a bit like a hoax. Although my experiences would
sound like the later to many people I swear that I believe all that
I've seen to be true although unexplicable. <br>
As many of your stories my experiences also started in childhood. Mine
I believe may be a result of troubled years reflecting child abuse and
fears of daily trials. Perhaps my aparitions were given portal because
of the fears. I remember back as far as my early adolescence living in
a house that sent a chill in me and fear to go to the upstairs alone.
Now my very human predator used to lay wait for me in the long narrow
hallway around the wall from the stairway which accounts for some to
the fear. However, this person was not always present in my home. The
feeling was always there. I remember at night I slept in an antique
frame bed handed down through the family, I would lay very still and
that bed would shake like it had a vibrator attached. I heard sounds
and footsteps. Once, when a teenager I was alone in the house; I wanted
to wear a jacket that was stored in a third floor attic closet. I went
up the enclosed stairway to the top thinking of nothing but retreving
my jacket. When I stepped onto the floor an old wind-up antique
victrola record player started playilng a very creepy song called
Fernando's Hide-A-Way. I have hated that song since I was a baby and my
brothers would play it to frighten me and make me cry. I ran out of my
house frightened by the song and about ten blocks to my best friends
house. When I got there her mother (known as the gypsy lady) was havin
a seance in her kitchen, the table these people were standing around
rose off of the floor and knocked me down. I bolted from there
too.&nbsp; To this point most of my experience was sound, and physical
experiences, I had not seen any apparitions. <br>
During my second marriage in my late twenties, my husband and I bought
an old log cabin which was hand-built with logs and stone from the land
it stood on many years earlier. It was beside the Chilisqaukee Creek on
old Indian grounds. This is where I began to see apparitions. Both
frightening experiences and enlightning experiences. Many things
occurred; an unseen force put a large dent in a metal cabinet in the
laundry room right before my eyes. My little 3 year old step daughter
would not stay in her bed, she would crawl under the bed to sleep, or
hide in a closet. One night I found her under clothes in a laundry
basket in the laundry just outside of her bedroom. This area of the
house seemed to be the most effected. It was here that one afternoon
while putting clothes into the washer that I felt a cold hand on my
shoulder; I was alone in the house at the time. When I looked behind me
I saw a black hooded, robed figure, I do not remember a face, Nor do I
remember this figure being much taller than me at 5'4" height.&nbsp; I
do remember getting very scared, I looked away and then it was gone. A
small bathroom was also off of this room, I recall once while taking a
morning shower hearing animal growling and scratching at the bathroom
door. These sounds disappeared when I began reciting the Twentythird
Psalm. <br>
One night while I was sick with the Flu and spending the night on the
sofa; I remember awakening to an apparition "copy cat" that looked
exactly like my husband in his pajamas in the bedroom doorway; but he
was transparent. This also dissappeared after a breif encounter. Our
life together in this house was rocky and I thought perhaps I was
loosing my mind. I did not do drugs and only drank socially everything
that was happening was very real. On final memory I have was I believe
a result of my depression which I was falling into; I had come to a
point that I did not want to leave the house. I also knew in my heart
that my husband was having an affair. I one night after contemplating
ending my life; sought God through deep prayer and called the 700 club
to ask for the prayer-line to praky for me. The same night while I lay
in bed alone in my dark room a light started to shine in the corner
across from my bed; it grew brighter and was in the form of a bright
white light ball that floated across the room and hovered at my
bedside. I was not frightened and reached up to investigate; I felt a
hand from out of the light take my hand and I heard a mental message
say that everything would be OK. The light then just went away. I was
left feeling cleansed, happy, and pure as if touched by God himself. I
wanted to go tell the world that life goes on and we are meant to be
holy, I couldn't utter swear words, and put down my cigarettes. This
cleansing phenomina unfortunately was temporary and I slid back into my
old ways after a few weeks. The divorce occured, we moved out of that
house and my life went on. The OK part came a few years later when I
became a mother of my own child for the first time, then I went to
school and became a registered nurse. I fell in love with the man that
I am now married to and we have been together for 20 years. That was
the last apparition that I have seen. <br>
Until my nursing career took me into some old nursing homes. I tend to
always work the night shift it fits into my life style. One night while
working in a home in Lewisburg, Pa. I saw a stange occurrance. A helium
birthday balloon floated out of one resident's room, traveled down the
center of a long corrider as if being held in the hand of a child it
bounced along hitting the ceiling at times and floating down but in a
straight line it moved down that hallway. The balloon took a turn at
another resident's room and went inside. This resident started
screaming to get that out of her room; by the way it was her birthday.
The same nursing home was the place of violence one suicide hanging,
and another murder suicide occurred there during the three years that I
worked there. I have other stories; but this is enough for now. <br>

Gypsy<br>
<br>
By: terrikeencoffman@aol.com<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Found as tiny stray, Gypsy, my tabby, had been abandoned by her mother.
We took her in and for the next 14 years, we were were inseparable. By
age 14, Gypsy's health was already compromised by severe arthritis and
she was no longer able to jump up in the bed to sleep with me. As time
went on, the pain medication seemed to have less and less effect on her
and she would often hide in the deepest, darkest closet in the hottest
room in the house. She would have to lay down to eat or drink. On June
19, 2007, the vet said, 'It's time. You've done everything you can for
her. Do you love her enough to put her out of her pain?" <br>
As I held her and told her I loved her, the vet administered the
injection. Afterwards, I brought her home, buried her beneath my
bedroom window where she used to look outI placedangel statue on her
grave. That night, I cried myself to sleep missing my best friend. The
next night, I felt her jump on the bed at my feet. I sat up looking,
but nothing was there. I felt her walk up by my hip and lay down. I
reached out to stroke the air, feeling the cool change in temperature.
For several weeks, while I grieved out of guilt of having put her to
sleep, every night, sometimes just as I would climb into bed, I would
feel the familiar pounce. Sometimes, she would gingerly walk over my
feet and up the other side of me. Sometimes, she was content to just
lay at the foot of the bed. I never saw an image, a mist, no form of
any kind, but it was Gypsy. She kept coming back for weeks, to console
me. I wasn't surprised.<br>
After all, for 14 years, anytime a family member was ill, she'd get in
bed with them and console them with her presence. I believe that's what
she was doing - that, and to tell me, "Look what I can do! I'm no
longer in pain and I'm at peace. But I'm still here. After all, this is
my home!"<br>
Now, Gypsy has started jumping in my mom's bed. (We live together.) Mom
will sit up in bed, after feeling the "pounce", but nothing visible is
there. It's only our beloved cat.<br>

My Brother and My Personal Experiences<br>
<br>
By: badgirlz_19_18@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
When my dad, Josh and me moved into that address when I was 13, that
first nite I couldnt sleep I had my bed between 2 little windows and I
kept hearing old fashioned civil war boots pacing around up in the
attic, I moved my bed across the room the sounds followed the bed until
1 nite I said enough, I am trying to sleep and the noices stopped.<br>
Josh and I we seen ghost there 3 separate times when it was just me Josh in the house.<br>
Josh was making fun of the Kiccapoo tribe and he was pushed from
behind, there was no one there I was standing infront of him across the
room.<br>
I was standing in the kitchen and my Josh was standing in the dinning
room there is a huge mirror, we were talking then we seen a teenager in
all black clothes and she had red eyes she looked at Josh then she
looked at me and then she disappeared into the mirror.<br>
Somthing grabed my leg as I was about to come downstair and it threw
me, I feel down the stairs, that time my parents were at home.<br>
The same spirit that grabed my leg and pushed me, picked my brother
Jacob he was 2 at time, the spirt was about to threw him when my mom
said to put him down and he was st down. <br>
My cousin Mindy was afraid to go into my room alone. <br>
My grandpa and his wife had bought the house from a widow, her husband
died in the house in the room I got, he hung himself, but the report
said he died of natural causes. His widow said she found him haning.
She sold the house to my grandpa after him and his wife got divorced
and he married my grandma in 99' he let me and my dad and Josh move
into the house we had no where to go because my dad and ex-step mom had
got divorced.<br>
We left the house in 01 and moved into with our mom. I came back to the
house to get some stuff in 01 or 02. I got my stuff as I looked back at
the house, the curtains in the room that I used to have were moving.
The windows were shut and locked. I said I am leaving and you cant come
with me, goodbye forever, and the curatins shut and moved no more. <br>
The house was built in 1900. I think the house is haunted by more then 1 spirit a few nice but a few mean.<br>

I thought I Saw a Ghost and I was not in My Body Anymore<br>
<br>
By: Massagebymyrna@aol.com<br>
<br>
<br>
i had this amazing experience one time at my grandma's house. we had
been living there temporarily for a year, and i slept in the room my
greatgrandmother lived in (and died in, i don't know). so one night i
go to bed kind of late, like 12:00am. i'm falling asleep, and iam
slowly drifting out of my body. a world similar to Heaven fills my eyes
(i did not know if they were open or closed) and i'm levatating above a
crystal clear river with lust plants below. a breeze touches my body,
and i hear extremely beuatiful music. but it wasen't from an
instrument. i don't know what it was. then i fall back into my body,
and i am shaking with...fear? <br>
i begin fall asleep again. this time i'm floating out of my body, and i
see strange shadow people walk across my plane of sight. they are
semitransparent and have misty grey specks of stuff that swirl around
and form bodies. i could not tell who they were. (by the way, this
house is as old as the 1930's). then i'm freaking out like no other,
and i fly out of the room and into the living room, and somehow it
appears to be daytime. A quit whirring noise occurs, and grows into a
monsterous roar. i see my body curled up in a ball on the floor and i'm
covering my ears. i see my family (alive) around me yelling at me, but
all i can hear is the sound. almost like a rocket blasting off, only
with scissors. then i get dragged back into the bedroom and as i am
sinking downward, i see two "ectoplasmic faces" staring at me and
flying away. it was just like what people talk about when they see
ghosts. i hope you enjoyed my true story. i don't know how it happened<br>

My Ghost Experience<br>
<br>
By: voodoo_ideya@yahoo.com <br>
<br>
I have a little ghost story for you all. A long time ago I lived with
my mom and grandparents. During this time weird things started
happening. Apparently I made a new friend no one else could see.<br>
It&#8217;s name was Julie. I had no idea what gender it was due to him/her being too severely burned. <br>
My grandma tells me that when I was about eight months old I would
start staring into space a lot. Like I was watching something. As I got
older I would start making weird gestures and noises like I was telling
some one to cut it out. I guess s/he was my friend.<br>
Julie never tried to hurt anyone. I&#8217;m not sure why he was even there. <br>
I stopped seeing her when I was about two. But she&#8217;s still in the
house. Some how he found his way to the upstairs house (Two story
building) where my great aunt lives. The only thing she really does now
is take my little cousins bottle. But that&#8217;s about it.<br>
I don&#8217;t know any history of my grandma&#8217;s house or the neighborhood around it. But I&#8217;m convinced some type of fire broke out. <br>
The funny thing though, is that Julie wasn&#8217;t the only spirit to be
seen. The only other time one was seen was by my grandpa. This is what
happened to him.<br>
He was sleeping on the couch in the living room. He says he woke up to
a little child, that looked no more then one years old, jumping on his
stomach. After which it giggled and ran behind the couch.<br>
Some years in the future I plan to have a pro go to the house and tell
me more about Julie and see if the little girl is still there. Hope you
guys enjoyed my little story!^^<br>

St. Elizabeth Medical Center<br>

They have reopened this hospital in Dayton, OH.&nbsp; I am a telephone
guy and I have a number of clients in there.&nbsp; One day I was called
in&nbsp; <br>
there to work on the weekend.&nbsp;&nbsp; When I went to the telephone closet&nbsp; <br>
in the basement My equipment was unplugged.&nbsp; I plugged it back in
and waited for the system to come back up, shut the door and went back
upstairs.&nbsp; When I got back up to the first floor my customer
stated that they were working for only a second then went back
down.&nbsp; I went back down to the basement and plugged it back in.
Thinking that it must have just fallen out&nbsp; I put a tie wrap on
the power cord to attach it to the battery backup and went back up
stairs.&nbsp; The exact same thing happened again.&nbsp; I started to
get suspicious this time.&nbsp; I went back down stairs and my tie wrap
was laying on the ground.&nbsp; Out&nbsp; <br>
of the corner of my eye I saw a little girl run out of the room.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
There was no where for her to hide in the room.&nbsp; I put a tie wrap
back on the power cord and locked the door back behind me again,
this&nbsp; <br>
time I asked out loud for her to please leave the equipment alone.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
It worked.&nbsp; I have not been back in the basement since.&nbsp; The
place has&nbsp; always given me the creeps and now I know why.<br>

Ghosts...<br>

The Willard P. Hall mansion on Hall Street in Saint Joseph, Missouri is
haunted.&nbsp; Willard P. Hall was the Lieutenant Governor of Missouri
during the last part of the Civil War.&nbsp; When the Governor died,
Willard assumed the office of Governor.&nbsp; With the Civil War
raging, he moved the statehouse from Jefferson City to Saint
Joseph.&nbsp; I don't know why he did that because Saint Joseph was
pretty well known to favor the South.<br>
After the mansion was used as a residence it became a rectory for
priests who served the Sts. Peter and Paul Catholic Church parish next
door.&nbsp; As parishes were closed in the Diocese of Kansas City -
Saint Joseph, one priest took over the Sts. Peter and Paul Church and
the Immaculate Conception Church (a church immediately West...about
three-quarter mile away).&nbsp; The pastor leased out the first floor
of the house, at that time, to United Cerebal Palsey and allowed me to
live upstairs to oversee the property so it would not be vandalized.<br>
Most of the walls throughout the house were solid brick/stone
construction, yet sounds of large rats could be heard scrambling
wlithin those walls.&nbsp; The light switches in "the old servants
quarters" upstairs, where I lived, were not up and down switches...but
to rotated in a circular manner.&nbsp; Those switches were observed
rotating, on their own, turning the lights on and off.&nbsp; Dark
shadows frequently covered doorways eliminating all light outside those
particular rooms.&nbsp; Once, when that happened, a loud scream, like
that of a large wild cat (lion/tiger) could be heard and it was ear
shattering.&nbsp; The room on the Southwest Corner upstairs, that was
my bedroom, became so cold that ice actually formed thick in the
corners of the room and the walls were frosty.&nbsp; Sounds of music,
like a very soft harp, was heard on occassion by a number of
people.&nbsp; One parish council meeting stopped suddenly when one of
the councilwomen, who was wearing a shoulderless summer dress, felt an
icy hand placed upon her shoulder...and no one was behiind her.&nbsp;
And, finally, many times when it was very late at night, or very early
morning, one could hear footsteps throughout the house followed by a
conversation that always turned into an argument and then was followed
by the soft crying of a woman.&nbsp; The basement of the mansion
appears to have been used for either slaves or prisoners and there is
rumor that there is a cave entrance hidden somewhere in the basement
that leads down to the Missouri River, a distance of about a mile and a
half.&nbsp; (I never found it.)&nbsp; When I called the pastor, once in
the middle of the night, and asked him to come over and experience some
of these goings on (the icy room, a darkened doorway and the sound of a
screaming large cat)...he told me, "No way.&nbsp; Do you think I'm
nuts?&nbsp; I'll come over first thing in the morning".&nbsp; He never
showed up...and, I moved.&nbsp; The place is still standing, but I
haven't been back.<br>

Haunting In Newton<br>
<br>

Hello, I live in Newton, NC and I am addicted to this site. My story
happened about 5 years ago. Me and my sister (Melissa) lived next door
to one another at the time. The house that she lived in had been vacant
for about 16 years. The previous owner was according to the neighbors a
very mean only lady who had been sent to live in a nursing home and
refused to allow her home to be sold. It stayed that way until her
death. As soon as she died, her children put the house up for sell and
my sister bought it. At first it was just little things that happened.
Melissa and my nephew (he was 3 at the time) were sitting in the living
room with no tv on and he asked her who was there because he heard
people talking on the stairs. They were alone in the house at the time.
The stairs were a hot spot in that house. When she was pregnant with my
neice she fell (or was pushed) down them 3 times. Her family had went
on vacation for the week, so I was left to take care of the animals.
Well 3 days into their vacation, I went over to feed and water and I
heard a horrible commotion upstairs. It sounded like the house was
falling apart. So I freaked out and left and didn't return. Poor
cats!&nbsp; When they got home from vacation I told them what happened
and my brother in law went to check and in their bedroom (which was
once the previous owners)and my sisters entire closet was dumped out in
the middle of the bedroom floor. Everything! Nothing else was disturbed
in the house and nothing was missing. Same bedroom...my sister was
sleeping and woke to an old woman walking across her bedroom floor to
the window. She described her and my mother went to the library to pull
old obitutaries and she showed the picture to my sister. She
immediately broke down in tears because she was looking at the woman
she had seen in her room. She immediately started packing and sold the
home. The new owners now have similar things going on. Their daughter
was pushed down the stairs and their son has seen a man in one of the
bedrooms on numerous occasions. And then the came home one day to find
their cat dead at the foot of the stairs! Creepy!<br>

GHOST/SPIRIT/ANGEL OR SOMETHING ELSE?<br>

My mom had about 3 years of on and off visitations.&nbsp; She would
wake up around 11:00 at night with a start to see different shapes of a
grayish/white "fog" which every time she would think it was smoke and
her house was on fire.&nbsp; Sometimes the fog was in a blue arc by her
dresser, sometimes the whole room was filled up with a misty fog, other
times it was 3 big ovals by her tv, and even sometimes she had a big
oval on all 3 sides of her bed.&nbsp; The one that really scared her
was when she woke up to see the fog by the foot of her bed, then it
flew over her with such a force and went through her wall above her
headboard.&nbsp; Mom even walked through the "misty fog" one night,
because again, she thought her house was on fire and she jumped up to
get her robe.&nbsp; I asked her if it was cold when she went through it
and she said that it wasn't and it didn't smell either.&nbsp; She did
see one apparition of a boy of about 18 years old.&nbsp; He was
standing next to her bed with his head down.&nbsp; Mom said he was
grayish looking and she did not talk to him, but she felt an awful
sadness emanating from him.&nbsp; Shortly after that we had somebody
come and clear the house.&nbsp; The woman who cleared the house said
that since mom volunteered at a hospital, she was bringing all sort of
spirits/ghosts back home with her.&nbsp; They sort of attached
themselves to her.&nbsp; After that, mom said that the house felt very
empty.&nbsp; It's been 2 years since her house has been cleared and so
far, so good.&nbsp; I think we also brought "stuff" in because when we
were kids we would play with the Ouija board in the 1960's.&nbsp; Now I
know just how dangerous it is to use one of them unless you really know
what you're doing.&nbsp; But in the 1960's you really didn't hear
anything about the dangers of Ouija boards - it was just plain
fun.&nbsp; When the person who cleared mom's home found a ghost of a
man under the stairs in the workroom, it kind of explained why my Dad
and my sister always felt like they were being poked in their backs by
an unseen finger.&nbsp; And us kids always hated to go into the laundry
room to get pop out of the fridge for supper.&nbsp; We would get the
pop and run up the stairs as fast as we could.&nbsp; All 3 of us kids
did the same thing, we couldn't wait to get out of that room!&nbsp; I
really think that spirit hung around since we "dug" him up in the 60's
with the Ouija board.&nbsp; He's gone now though and hopefully at peace.<br>
