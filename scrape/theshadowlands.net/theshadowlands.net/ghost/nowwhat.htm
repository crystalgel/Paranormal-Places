<center><b><font face="Arrus BT"><font size=+2>I have a ghost, now what?</font></font></b><b><font face="Arrus BT"></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arrus BT">By Dave Juliano</font></b></center>
<b><font face="Arrus BT"></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arrus BT">Ok, so you’ve done a little research.&nbsp;
You have read a little, asked a few questions and you are pretty sure that
you are dealing with a human spirit that apparently has taken up residence
with you or you with it.&nbsp; So now what do you do?&nbsp; Sell the house?&nbsp;
Call an exorcist?&nbsp; Have a s&eacute;ance? Buy an Ouija board?&nbsp;
The answer is…none of the above.&nbsp; In the vast majority of cases, there
is no reason to do anything but take a deep breath and relax.&nbsp; Many
people are not bothered at all by spirits in their homes because they can
accept them for what they are and they realize that there is nothing to
fear.&nbsp; This accounts for about thirty percent of the cases I come
in contact with.&nbsp; For the other seventy percent of you I would like
to offer some advice, tips and suggestions so that you can feel more comfortable
with your situation.</font></b><b><font face="Arrus BT"></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arrus BT">What many people experience when event start
to occur in their homes is fear.&nbsp; Fear of ghosts, fear that you are
imagining things and losing your mind, etc.&nbsp; Fear is a natural instinct
that is intended to warn you when imminent danger is close but it also
manifests itself when the mind is faced with an unknown or unexplainable
situation.&nbsp; Let’s deal with the people who are afraid of ghosts first.</font></b><b><font face="Arrus BT"></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arrus BT">First off don't be scared, I know that sounds
funny and I would have laughed at someone who told me that 15 years ago
when I was in the middle of my own haunting, but it's true.&nbsp; You have
a human spirit that is living there with you or just passing through, they
are harmless, a bit unnerving and scary at times, but that is not what
they are trying to be.&nbsp; They are simply letting you know, since someone
can see the things it does, that it is in the house.&nbsp; It is it's only
way of communicating with us. It may be lost or stuck here and has not
passed properly to the other side or it may be here visiting a place it
loved in life.&nbsp; Either way the events you are experiencing are not
dangerous and will not be harmful in any way.</font></b><b><font face="Arrus BT"></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arrus BT">Having said that, is there anything in particular
that the spirit is doing that is bothering you?&nbsp; If so, try telling
it.&nbsp; Yes, I mean speaking out loud to something you aren’t necessarily
seeing at the time.&nbsp; Spirits often respond very well to this if you
are calm, firm and respectful.&nbsp; Don’t yell, curse at or antagonized
the spirit.&nbsp; They are still a human consciousness and they have the
same emotions, moods and attitudes they did in life.&nbsp; Yelling may
upset or anger the spirit and then they will not stop what you have asked
them to.&nbsp; In fact they may do a bit more.&nbsp; Speak to them just
like you are talking to a friend and explain what your problem is and ask
if they could stop.&nbsp;&nbsp; Remain positive and avoid negativity and
fear as much as possible.&nbsp; Negativity and fear can cause more problems
for you in the long run.</font></b><b><font face="Arrus BT"></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arrus BT">Can you get the spirits to leave?&nbsp; Only
if it decides to go.&nbsp; A human spirit has the free will to decide when
and where it will go.&nbsp;&nbsp; Keep in mind the spirit may not realize
it is dead or may be afraid of leaving so they will not go just because
you want them to.&nbsp; In these cases you need to employ psychology to
help the spirit move along but there is still no guarantee that the spirit
will leave.&nbsp; No one can make a human spirit leave if it does not want
to.&nbsp; You local ghost research group often has sensitives that can
help understand why the spirit is there and that can often help in getting
the spirit to move on.&nbsp; I’ll get to picking a group to help you in
a moment.</font></b><b><font face="Arrus BT"></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arrus BT">Some of you may just be afraid that you mind
may not be what it used to be and that you are imagining things.&nbsp;
If you are the only person in the house that is experiencing anything don’t
worry, that is not uncommon at all.&nbsp; With one or two exceptions over
26 years, I was the only one who was affected in my childhood home.&nbsp;
What I always recommend to people who just want some validation of their
claims for their own peace of mind is to contact their local ghost research
group or ghost hunters group.&nbsp; These groups can assist you in getting
unbiased evidence and evaluating you situation.&nbsp; They can also educate
you on living with ghosts.</font></b><b><font face="Arrus BT"></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arrus BT">So, now your looking for a group to assist
you with whatever your situation may be.&nbsp; There are numerous groups
out there. How do you pick one?&nbsp; To find local groups you can do a
search on the net for your area.&nbsp; I maintain one of the largest and
most frequently updated listings in a state-by-state format <a href="groups.htm">http://theshadowlands.net/ghost/groups.htm</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Are there a lot of groups that are just starting out, are just clubs or
have little experience?&nbsp; Yes, but there are just as many groups that
have lots of experience.&nbsp;&nbsp; Experience can also be personal experience.&nbsp;
A person who has lived in a haunted home knows things a person who just
studies them does not.&nbsp; Remember that you are going to be letting
these people into your home so you want to be sure you feel comfortable
with their procedures, experience and their members.&nbsp;&nbsp; Review
their website to see what they have done in the past, the groups theories
and other biographical information.&nbsp;&nbsp; Talk to the group’s leadership
on the phone or in person prior to agreeing to retain their services.&nbsp;
Ask them for references.&nbsp; Ask them if they have case experience with
situations similar to yours.&nbsp; Ask them about their investigation procedures,
their equipment and how they will report their findings to you.&nbsp; Ask
everything and anything you want until you feel comfortable with them.</font></b><b><font face="Arrus BT"></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arrus BT">Most groups do not charge for their services.&nbsp;
Some do ask for donations or fees to cover the cost of travel and equipment
materials such as film, tapes and processing.&nbsp;&nbsp; If a group wants
to charge you a high fee or they cannot justify the expense fee they charge,
then move on to the next group.&nbsp; Use simple common sense so you don’t
get taken to the cleaners by unscrupulous researchers who are taking advantage
of your fears.&nbsp;&nbsp; The group I belong to, South Jersey Ghost Research
started a trend a couple years ago by going non-profit and applying for
that status officially with the IRS.&nbsp;&nbsp; Many groups are now following
this example and this can give you yet another sense of security about
the group you are choosing.&nbsp; This enables groups to get funds for
necessities without having to deal with monetary issues with their clients.</font></b><b><font face="Arrus BT"></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arrus BT">Once you have done all you can do with your
situation and you still feel uneasy, curious or afraid then you should
try reaching out to people who understand and care about you and your situation.&nbsp;
These people can help and as long as you are careful whom you choose to
assist you, you should get some sort of resolution to your problem.</font></b>
