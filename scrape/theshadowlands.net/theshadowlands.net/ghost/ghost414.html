Family Cabin<br>
<br>
By: RendellA@graphicpkg.com<br>
<br>
Our family has a cabin in the woods on Bunker Hill in New Hampshire. It
was built by hand the old-fashion way by my Great-Grandfather in 1931.
Last fall while sitting around the campfire, my cousins and I shared
&#8220;weird stories&#8221; about the cabin. Here are two of them. One cousin and a
friend went to stay up there once in the winter in the late 70&#8217;s.
Usually no one goes up there in the winter. It was early evening and
they were cooking supper when all of a sudden the front door shook hard
as if someone was trying to open it. It shook so hard that the dishes
and glasses on the kitchen selves rattled. My cousin called out, &#8220;Who&#8217;s
there?&#8221;, but got no answer. His friend and he were getting a little
unnerved. My cousin grabbed the fireplace poker and his friend grabbed
a butcher knife. When they flung open the door there was no one there.
It was snowing hard and had covered their tracks from earlier in the
day. There were no fresh footprints at the door or leading up to the
deck. They had no explanation for it. They pegged the door shut and had
no more problems the rest of the night. In 2001, I was staying there by
myself one July. It is a little unsettling staying there alone as you
are out in the woods by yourself with no one around. I had just gone to
bed and was half asleep when I looked over at the doorway going into
the living room. I had the feeling more than seeing it; that there was
someone standing there. It was almost like a fine white cloudy figure.
I felt a feeling of my grandfather, who died in 1979. As I love him
very much and he felt I was more a son then a grandson to him I wasn&#8217;t
scared. I rolled over on my stomach with the idea of going to sleep. I
heard real soft running steps and felt some one jump on my back. That
brought me fully awake and I sat right up. No one was there. My
Grandfather was a big practical joker with an equally big sense of
humor. I think he was pulling a fast one on me. I had no other things
happen to me the rest of my stay. My family has also had three
different Sasquatch experiences at the cabin but that is a different
matter.<br>

Young Sensitive<br>
<br>
By: furlongtours@optusnet.com.au<br>
<br>
Hi I am a sensitive more than a clairvoyant<br>
and have seen ghosts all my life.<br>
The first I can remember was my Pa who had recently died. I was 4 and
climbed the stairs with my Nan not far behind me. I saw my Pa out the
window and&nbsp; I assumed he was on a ladder. I was really excited and
said hello and told Nan. She was very frightened and tried to usher me
away, but my Pa smiled and waved, I hadnt been allowed to attend his
funeral.<br>
Since then I have seen ,talked with or&nbsp; been spoken to by many ghosts.<br>
At times I have been afraid ,&nbsp; but usually its alot like
normality.I have received information at times and have to live and
deal with this . Other times an old deceased friend may be seen for
days until I click ,the date was either their birthday or has some
other relevance to them. They never cease to surprise me.I sometimes
consider this a burden but for the most part I can accept it as a gift
and am grateful for who I am.On ending when I am frightened or think
the ghost isbad I say '' In the name of Jesus Christ leave me now'' I
am not a christian , but am sure he was a good bloke ! ie; Saint.Its
not failed. T hanks and maybe Ill post some more of my dealings at
another date, with love and light&nbsp; <br>

A Haunted Trailer<br>
<br>
By: Anonymous<br>
<br>
I would like to remain anonymous with this please. Thank you.<br>
This story is from years ago when my two daughters were quite young.
Around six months and three. We lived in an old two bedroom trailer on
the corner of a very small town. The events are still quite clear in my
mind as we experienced things practically daily for the entire time we
lived there (about four or five years). I won't write about all my
experiences in this one email as I am sure it would be too long.<br>
One of the main things that sticks out was when my youngest was around
six months old. The two bedrooms were on opposite ends of the house,
separated by a small hallway, bathroom, the kitchen and the large
family room. Because the kids bedroom was so far away from ours, we
used a baby monitor. Now, I am not exactly a technology buff and in
fact, sometimes I'm down right dumb when it comes to things like that,
but I do know the workings of most every day things. It started one
night when I'd put the kids to bed and decided to stay up and read in
bed. It was around midnight and I was comfortably propped against my
pillows and very into my book when I heard a faint, but distinctively
male voice come over the baby monitor. It happened so quick that I
thought perhaps I was imagining things, so I went on reading.<br>
Not five minutes later, I heard the voice again. This time, it was a
bit clearer and a bit louder. I got up and decided to check on the
kids. When I got into their room, they were sleeping soundly and there
was nothing amiss. It was a cool night, so no windows were open to pick
up any voices from outside and the television was off. At the time, we
had no radio. I went back to my room and settled back into bed and
began reading again. A half hour passed quietly with not a sound from
the monitor when all the sudden I heard the voice again and this time
it said my name. Now, I have a very unusual and distinct name. So I
could not have mistaken this. <br>
By this time, I was getting a bit annoyed. I got up and, before going
to check on my kids, I checked that the door was locked (this door was
situated just outside my bedroom door and was quite noisy when opened)
and then went to check on them once again. As before, they were sound
asleep and nothing was amiss. Now I was nearly getting angry and
shouted for whoever it was to stop. I stomped back to my room and set
my book aside, thinking I would just go to sleep. Now, for anyone who
knows me well enough, knows that for one, I don't like the dark. I
always sleep with a lamp on. I also have this pet peeve about closet
and cabinet doors. They always have to be closed. Don't ask me why. <br>
Anyway, when I returned to my room, I found the sliding closet doors
standing open. I knew for a fact they were closed because of my slight
obsession. So, I closed them and made sure to leave my lamp on. Before
I climbed into bed, I decided to turn the baby monitor down a bit in
hopes that I would not hear the voice again. It was situated on a
dresser across the room from my bed. Imagine my surprise when I went to
turn it down only to find it completely off! I had forgotten to turn it
on! I didn't sleep much that night.<br>
A footnote; When I told my husband of these happenings, he wrote it off
as CB interference. Now, I could see that if the monitor was on. And I
also have to wonder because they said my name and I have only ever met
one other person with my name. Who knows. Also, as I'd thought of it
myself, there was no possible way that anyone could have entered this
trailer and been playing a trick on me. The front door was blocked by a
large, and old armoire and as I said earlier, the other door was right
by my bedroom, locked, and very noisy. And the windows of this trailer
were designed so basically no one could come in through them as they
were very high off the ground and had three to four panes that were
cranked open, but didn't leave hardly any space to get in.<br>
This particular story isn't exactly frightening, just slightly eerie, I
suppose. I'll share more of my experiences in this trailor some other
time<br>

Ghost's Story<br>
<br>
By: tanzanite_21@hotmail.com<br>
<br>
I have many stories to share with you all.&nbsp; Here's one of the many that I have....<br>
It was in the late winter/early spring of 1997.&nbsp; I was spending
the night at my baba's house after attending a hockey game.&nbsp; It
was shortly before midnight when I had shut off the light and crawled
into bed.&nbsp; I was lying in bed, on my stomach for at most 2
minutes, when sudenly I felt 2 hands on my back.&nbsp; The hands shoved
me into the bed so hard that the bed shook for a good minute or
two.&nbsp; I froze with terror, not knowing what to do.&nbsp; I did'nt
know if I should turn around to see if there was any one there to see,
or just lye there and try to get to sleep.<br>
I decided to very slowly turn around to see if I could see any
one.&nbsp; As I turned, I was trying to prepare myself for what, if
anything, that I would see.&nbsp; When I finally did turn onto my back,
I was relieved to see nothing.&nbsp; <br>
I laid in bed with my eyes wide open and my mind racing.&nbsp; I was
trying to calm myself down before trying to sleep.&nbsp; After a few
moments, I closed my eyes and thought, "Ok, I'm going to sleep now.",
and fell asleep shortly after that.<br>

<br>
The ghostly dog.&nbsp; If anyone happens to see this dog again.&nbsp;
Call Peppy.&nbsp; This might be a dog I owned as a child &#8211; we lived in
Carnation.&nbsp; My folks built a home in Fall City in 1971 &#8211; when we
moved I came home one day and my dog was gone.&nbsp; Beautiful white
and light rusty colored dog.&nbsp; Peppy had been my dog for 6
years.&nbsp; An awesome dog.&nbsp; My bud.&nbsp; My Father said &#8211; he
had given my dog to our old neighbors&#8230;( just like that ) I cried &amp;
cried and got on my bike and road from Fall City to Carnation &#8211; part on
that little back road around the river&#8230;then out onto the main road the
rest of the way&#8230;the entire way I was sobbing.&nbsp; I got to our old
neighbors house and there Mother said &#8211; we shot your dog !!!!!! He bit
one of there kids!!!! No way&#8230;..I called them killers..as my dog was so
friendly &#8211; I would put a long piece of grass in his mouth and he would
lead me around strutting like a show dog.&nbsp; I had a sister in a
wheel chair and he would make sure she was o.k.&nbsp; Anyway &#8211; it was a
long ride home still crying and even more so on the back road where the
jogger saw my Peppy.&nbsp; I know it is him.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t talk to my
Father for sometime. He passed when I was 18 and I always wondered how
he could have done that&#8230;giving away a childs pet????&nbsp; A few years
later that same family who my father gave our dog to&#8230;there son murdered
a young girl.&nbsp; He was captured and is in prison.&nbsp; I knew in
my heart that my&nbsp; dog must have suffered&#8230;just call Peppy if anyone
sees this dog again.&nbsp; Next time I am south I am going on the back
road to see Peppy and tell him&#8230;its o.k. &#8211; go home&#8230;rest &#8230;..You&#8217;re the
best.&nbsp; This is sad but true.&nbsp; When I read this caption&#8230;I knew
it was Peppy looking for me.&nbsp; Or making sure people are safe.<br>

One summer night in 1943, my father died in a terrible traffic
accident. I will always remember this schook. In that time I was very
young.<br>
One day in 1967. I was driving home in the evening. I remember that I
was very tired. When I was driving I felt m y fathers soul, then&nbsp;
I looked on the right and I saw my father.<br>
He smiled at me and said:"hello, my dear. I died very young. I
coldn&acute;t give you all the money that I wanted to give you. I know
that since you were a baby you wanted a big house in the country and
have a better life for all my family. Please play the lottery tomorrow"<br>

The Ghost Party House<br>
<br>
By: dtnbcfritz@yahoo.com <br>
<br>
My husband I got married in September of 2000 and I moved into the
house he was renting in Charles town, WV.&nbsp; It was an old, turn of
the century house and it was beautiful.&nbsp; While we were dating, I
came to visit him while his parents were staying with him.&nbsp; I
slept in the guest room, his parents in the master bedroom and my
husband slept in the den.&nbsp; During the night, I woke up and felt I
was not alone, then I saw a dark figure walk in front of one of the
windows and then a few minutes later it walked in front of the other
window on the adjacent wall.&nbsp; I froze.&nbsp; I wasn't really
afraid, just a little freaked out.&nbsp; I pulled the covers up just
under my chin and closed my eyes tight and repeated silently to myself,
"I am protected by God and nothing can hurt me."&nbsp; I chanted it
silently like a mantra until I fell back to sleep. <br>
When I told my husband about it the next morning, he said I probably
saw the shadow of someone walking in front of the flood lights on the
wall of the apartment complex across the street.&nbsp; It isn't
possible that that could be the explanation because I didn't see the
shadow on a wall, it looked solid and passed in front of the window on
the inside.&nbsp; Also, we were on a second story.&nbsp; Later, when I
moved into the house, strange sounds started to occur.&nbsp; I took two
months off before looking for work so that I could unpack and get the
house in order.&nbsp; I took this time to indulge a little and slept in
until about 9:30 - 10:00 every morning.&nbsp; My husband would leave
for work in Dulles at 6:30 and I would fall back to sleep after he
left.&nbsp; At 8:00 every single morning, I would hear the front door
open (it was a large wooden door that would pop when it opened) and I
would hear footsteps walk up the stairs.&nbsp; I couldn't resist
getting up and looking around the house to see if anyone had
entered.&nbsp; I was always alone and the front door would still be
locked.<br>
&nbsp;I figured if this was it, then I was getting off easy.&nbsp; I
tried to ignore it a few times, but is sounded so real that I had to
get up and check.&nbsp; After a couple weeks of this, my husband's cat
started attacking random places on the walls of the house. <br>
The outside wall at the top of the stairs was her Nemesis.&nbsp; My
husband and I were watching television one night when the smell of
burnt hair penetrated the living room.&nbsp; The house was very open
with only four closing doors.&nbsp; There was a large arch between the
living room and the hallway where the front door and the staircase were
located.&nbsp; We got a little nervous because we thought that maybe we
had an electrical fire on our hands and started checking outlets.&nbsp;
The smell was very strong.&nbsp; We didn't realize it was odd until we
walked into the kitchen which had an open door to the hallway and the
smell didn't permeate into the kitchen.&nbsp; The smell was located
only in the hallway and the living room.&nbsp; We walked into every
room of the house and no other room had the smell. An hour later, the
smell left.&nbsp; A few days later, I went to dinner with a friend and
came home and when we walked into the front door, my husband came out
of the kitchen where he'd been doing dishes and asked when I came
home.&nbsp; I said I had just come in but he said it wasn't possible
because he'd just seen me walk from the stairs into the living
room.&nbsp; We looked into the living room and the curtains were
twisted very tightly into ropes.&nbsp; My friend promptly left the
house. <br>
Maggie, our cat, slept with us.&nbsp; She usually slept right up
against me, under my left arm.&nbsp; One night, she wouldn't come up
from the foot of the bed.&nbsp; She perched on the foot of the bed like
she was watching something.&nbsp; My husband fell asleep almost at once
upon getting into bed and I usually lie awake for a little while.&nbsp;
I was just starting to drift off to sleep when something in the hallway
growled.&nbsp; I told my husband about it and he asked if I was sure it
wasn't Maggie. <br>
There was no way it could have been the cat.&nbsp; I have had cats my
whole life and I know how they sound when they growl.&nbsp; It's
usually high pitched and gravely, but this was low and menacing.&nbsp;
It sounded like a large dog.&nbsp; Maggie sat on the foot of the bed
the entire night.&nbsp; I think she was protecting us.&nbsp; It's after
this that things got really crazy.&nbsp; My husband was setting the
table for dinner when the ceiling light fell out of the ceiling and
landed in the middle of the dining room table.&nbsp; It fell with
extreme force.<br>
&nbsp;We went away for a week and when we came back, three of the
glasses I bought right before we got married, were broken.&nbsp; Two
had been shattered, but one was still together and only fell apart when
we tried to pick it up.&nbsp; The top of the glass simply came off the
bottom part with a clean, precise edge cut diagonally through the
glass.&nbsp; When I would be home alone, Maggie would climb in my lap
and tap me on the cheek and then lead me out of the room, whenever I
came back, something had been moved.&nbsp; Once, my husband's friends
came to visit and we were sitting in the living room chatting when
Maggie came into the living room and stopped dead in her tracks.&nbsp;
Her tail puffed up and all her hair stood on end.&nbsp; She started
hissing at the middle of the living room.&nbsp; She was looking at the
floor.&nbsp; When any one of us tried to stand up, she would hiss and
us.&nbsp; This lasted for about 10 minutes. <br>
Then she ran upstairs and hid under the bed.&nbsp; Dishes were
regularly found broken in the cabinet and the curtains on the window
going up the stairs were twisted and knotted.&nbsp; One day while I was
talking on the phone to my sister-in-law, I was telling her about what
was happening in the house and the door at the top of the stairs
slammed shut.&nbsp; I thought that perhaps the wind had caught it and
went upstairs to open it and close the windows in the guest room at the
top of the stairs (the room was previously the den) and it wouldn't
open.&nbsp; I had to wait for my husband to come home to open it.&nbsp;
He had to throw his entire body weight against it to open the door, but
when it opened, none of the windows in the room were open.&nbsp; My
husband never believed me about the growling until one night he woke
out of a sound sleep and heard the same growling right next to the
bed.&nbsp; Maggie was perched on the edge of the bed watching the
floor.&nbsp; Soon after we decided to move.&nbsp; We packed up and had
everything but a futon mattress in a U-Haul and were sleeping on the
mattress in the dining room on our last night in the house.&nbsp; I
should say trying to sleep, but we couldn't.<br>
&nbsp;There was too much noise.&nbsp; It sounded like there was a party
in the living room, there were voices and the sound of glasses clinking
and it sounded like someone was running up and down the stairs hitting
the railing with a stick.&nbsp; We left the next day, very tired, but
happy to be leaving.&nbsp; Maggie went with us.&nbsp; We moved into a
new house and Maggie started attacking the walls and getting lost in
corners.&nbsp; The vet told us that she was very old and getting
blind.&nbsp; Finally, she got so bad that she had to be put down.&nbsp;
We were devastated.&nbsp; Two days after her death, I was sleeping and
woke up to the feeling of Maggie jumping on the bed and walking up to
sleep under my arm.&nbsp; I felt and extreme pressure on me and there
was a dark figure standing at the foot of the bed.&nbsp; I tried to
speak, to wake up my husband, but I couldn't make any sound.&nbsp; I
couldn't move at all.&nbsp; I wanted to scream, but couldn't.&nbsp; The
thing just stood there and I could tell it was getting a big kick out
of scaring me.&nbsp; Shortly after that, we got a new cat,
Dexter.&nbsp; Since we got Dex, we've had no experiences at all.&nbsp;
I suppose that there is something to the Egyptian myth that cats are
the keepers of the dead, because Maggie and Dex both have protected
me.&nbsp; I know that God protects me, and maybe he uses my kitties to
help with that protection.<br>

A Few Ghost Stories<br>
<br>
<br>
By: christinee11@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
My first story was when i lived in Trenton, NJ.&nbsp; I lived in a
historic part where many of the houses were built before the
1900's.&nbsp; I was about 3 years old when I started talking about my
imaginary friend.&nbsp; I descrbied him as a little boy about my age
who liked to play in my room and he lived in my closet.&nbsp; My mother
thought nothing of it until one night she heard me talking around 2am
and walked in to see me sitting up in bed and my rocking chair moving
back and forth.&nbsp; I also used to talk about a man with a gun in my
parents bedroom.&nbsp; We also experiened doors and windows opening and
closing and lights turning on and off.&nbsp; But one day after my 5th
birthday I was watching my the video from my 5th birthday.&nbsp; In the
middle of the video the VCR broke and began eating the tape.&nbsp; My
mom unplugged the VCR and decided to bring it in to get fixed that
week.&nbsp; The next morning we woke up and found the video laying on
the floor in perfect condition, and in the VCR was the movie a
beautiful life, a movie that neither of my parents have seen or
owned.&nbsp; After that my mother decided to do some research on the
house.&nbsp; She discovered that a man had commited suicude by shooting
himself in the head in his room and a 4 year old boy died of an illness
in mine.<br>
My other story is much recent.&nbsp; About 3 years ago I was in my
boyfriends house.&nbsp; He lived in an old house that was used as part
of the underground railroad in 1800's.&nbsp; Because of this his house
consisted of multiple secert passages.&nbsp; One of these secert
passages was located under the stairs.&nbsp; On a dare I decided to go
in by myself with the door closed.&nbsp; I sat in the spidery grossness
when I suddenly got extremely cold and started shaking I got nervous
and started banging on the door to get out..thinking i was joking my
friends were laughing on the other side I guess my screaming sounded
serious because the opened the door and found me laying down freezing
and shaking.&nbsp; It was a crazy experience.<br>

Ghosts and Children<br>
<br>
By: rednkgrl2004@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
I was reading an article on what you have written bout ghosts and
children. I just wanted to say that children do see ghosts / spirits
when most parents cannot. Myself, i was at a young age when I first
experienced a ghost or poltergeist. I was 15 years old and home
babysitting my younger siblings. It was late at night, when this took
place. I had been watching a T.V show when i fell asleep. I was woken
up to the sounds of firewood being thrown down on the back padio. I
thought it was in my mind and kept telling myself that it was just a
dream. I would try to go back to sleep and heard it again. I closed my
eyes and started back to sleep after reminding myself to ignore it
because its just in my mind. I then heard a brick sound hit the brick
wall where the fireplace was. I looked up at the wall, there was
nothing. So then at that time i was getting scared but yet tryin to
convince myself that its nothing. I rolled over facing the back of the
couch , right behind the couch was a big window, in which we had a
pitbull dog just outside the window due to the window wouldnt lock. I
was trying to go back to sleep and heard a knock on the window, that
scared me bad, knowing that NO ONE could possibly gotten into the
pitbulls fence without a fight. I then ran into my bedroom woke up my
sister and asked her to come in the other room and see if she can hear
the things i was hearing. She and I headed back to the living room , we
got to the end of the hallway and couldnt move, as if somethin or
someone was pushing us back. All we could do then was go backwards, so
we went and woke the others up and we all sat in their room the
remaining of the night. We could hear footsteps on the floor in the
other room, heard the washer and dryer moving about, heard the
silverware scuffling around. We could see a shadow form come down the
hallway. This went on from about 1am to 4am.<br>
Across the room where we was in, there was a bathroom, we always kept
the light on in there so if someone woke up we could see where we was
going. There was a window which leads to the front yard, so when our
parents came home we seen their headlights. We all stormed out the door
to meet our parents, we were terrified. My parents believed us , thank
god. Dad then told us that it was a ghost, but now that im older i
believe it was more of a poltergeist, but anyways thats when he told us
about ghosts and that they exist and that we weren't crazy. Today I am
35 years old. I have 4 children, 2 of them are teens and the other 2
are small. I have always taught my children of ghosts, and taught them
not to b scared. I can see ghosts , feel their presence, even at my age
now. As a matter of fact we are living with 3 ghosts right now. One is
a woman and 2 are men. They dont do anything to you but let you know
they are here. I just thought I would add that ghosts DO exist and so
does poltergeist. Some people can see them, feel their presence, some
cannot. You have to have an open mind and believe anything can happen,
nothing is impossible. Most people are scared of the unknown and dont
believe things until they experience it. I agree with you about ghosts
show themselves to the people who are sensitive to them, children or
adults, even animals can see them. Ghosts are everywhere!<br>

Incidences<br>
<br>
By: seneca48@verizon.net<br>
<br>
First off my name is Lou, short for Louise and I do believe in spirits
or ghosts, if you prefer.&nbsp; I have had a few experiences in my
lifetime and here are a couple of them.&nbsp; I was raised by my
grandparents and I married very young. I was 16 and became pregnant
right away.&nbsp; My grandmother was very excited about the baby and
had showers for me and bought all kinds of baby stuff.&nbsp; My husband
and I were living in a small apartment that had a big bay window right
outside of our bedroom.&nbsp; Everything started when we went on a trip
to Waterford, PA.&nbsp; My grandmother went along to visit her
relatives who also lived there.&nbsp; We were at my mothers in law
house when we got a phone call saying that my grandmother had a heart
attack and was being rushed to the hospital.&nbsp; Well, she seemed to
get better the first week, but then she had another attack and nearly
died.&nbsp; The doctor told my mother that he didn't know what was
keeping her alive, that she should have died after the last attack and
my mother told him that she wanted to live long enough to see the baby,
which was due any day.&nbsp; She did die a couple of days later.&nbsp;
I had the baby a few days later.&nbsp; It was the second night after we
brought him home that I had him in his crib in front of the bay window
and had just crawled into bed and turned out the light. I could see his
crib clearly in the light from the streetlight outside the house.&nbsp;
I saw the silhouette of&nbsp; my grandmother standing by his crib and
heard her say "Now I've seen him."&nbsp; I never did see her again,
although I did feel her presence on and off over the years.<br>
The second incident happened a couple of months later when we moved to
Grant St. In Union City, PA.&nbsp; We moved into a upstairs apartment,
which was very roomy and just right for us.&nbsp; When we looked at the
place, no one told us that a murder had happened in the attic.&nbsp; I
did notice that there was a big red square painted on the floor just
as&nbsp; you reached the top of the stairs, but I didn't ask about it
at the time.&nbsp; My friend lived up the street and she told me that
the lady who owned the house was killed at the top of the stairs by her
son in law. He had bashed her brains out when she reached the top of
the stairs to the attic.&nbsp; I had my sons crib in the bedroom that
had the attic door and it kept coming open so we finally locked it and
never went up there.&nbsp; We also had a dog and the dog would never go
in that room, just lay outside and growl.&nbsp; One night I was home
alone with the dog and baby as my husband was working late.&nbsp; I was
laying on the sofa watching TV and turned my back and all of a sudden
the hair on my neck and arms was standing up and a cold chill came over
me. I wanted to turn around and look, but I couldn't move.&nbsp; The
dog was under the bed, whining and growling for what seemed like an
eternity, but was in reality just a couple of minutes.&nbsp; I turned
around and nothing was there and the dog came out.&nbsp; We moved out
the next day.&nbsp; I told my husband that I wouldn't stay in the house
another night so we went to my friends house until we got a new place
and believe me I made sure there were no red squares painted anywhere.<br>
I did have other incidences, but maybe we will save those for another time.&nbsp; Thanks for listening. <br>

To The Ones Who Understand<br>
<br>
By: shespawn1@comcast.net<br>
<br>
Hi I've been reading the stories on your site for years, and your site
has helped me deal with the things that have happened to me. It started
when I moved into the apartment on Bellingham St in Chelsea Ma. A few
months before I got pregnant, I was reading in my living room sitting
in my bowl chair that was next to my window. All of a sudden the
lampshade next to me started to shake very lightly, I had the window
open so I figured the wind had caused it to shake. Then I wondered why
I had not felt the wind on my face, suddenly the chair I was sitting on
started to shake really hard.<br>
Needless to say I freaked out and ran to my bedroom where my husband
peacefully slept, I slammed the door shut and jumped into bed. I heard
a tap at my door, as if it were pronouncing that it was coming in , and
it did, it went straight across to my heater and taped it loudly, it
then went across the room again to tap the night stand&nbsp; next to me
, and then it pushed my husband (he is a heavy sleeper and was sleeping
on his side he rocked forward and then settled back into his original
undisturbed position) on it's way to the other corner of the room,
where it taped again before it left me alone. While I was pregnant, I
also had my teenage nieces (14 &amp;16) come to live with us through
foster care, at first every thing was ok , but then tension , arguments
and resentment between my husband &amp; I and our nieces ruined our
relationship. I wonder if IT caused all the tension that lead to the
deterioration of our relationship with the girls, my husband was
working two jobs, he was stressed out close to burned out and the girls
and I were always arguing about everything, I was stressed because of
the girls &amp; the pregnancy, and the girls with their teenage
hormones and attitude out of control..it was a train wreck waiting to
happen. During this time I would be in the apartment alone and I would
hear noises in the kitchen, I would be in the computer room (which is
located at the end of a long hallway &amp; kitchen is on the other end
of it) I would hear taping on the wall as if a person was walking down
the hall slowly and tapping on the wall every few steps. It would stop
at the heater right outside the computer room, I would turn to check
and of course I would find nothing, I would sometimes even say out loud
"what do you want?" and again no response. I would also smell cigarette
smoke in the bathroom&nbsp; every once in a while. When my son was born
he would stare into a corner of my room and giggle I would block his
view with my body and he would cringe his neck to look at whatever it
was in the corner. After we moved out from that apartment we moved to
Saugus Ma, things got more intense there. We would constantly hear
noises or banging when we would take showers or son would either be
sleeping or in the shower with us, and it would always happen when it
was just me and my son or my husband and my son. I found the "Prayer
for safety and strength" and I said said the prayer one day when I
decided to say he our father prayer as I put my son down for a nap. As
I said the prayer I started to experience chills I got a little scared
and decided to say both prayers and telling it that it was not allowed
to scare my son my husband or myself , I walked from room to room
saying these prayers and when I came into my room I felt pins &amp;
needles on my face and arms, as well as goose bumps.. It seemed to
increase as I recited the Hail Mary, I was more upset than scared at
this point. When I finished my prayers I started to was dishes I heard
a noise behind me in front of my fridge. I turned around and walked up
to the spot I thought I heard the noise and started the prayers again
and I felt the pins and needles on my face again. One time my husband
was home alone with my son , he said my son started running back &amp;
forth from his bedroom to the living room laughing as if someone was
playing with him and chasing him, my husband &amp; I totally freaked
out and were upset that it was playing with our son. We also have tons
of pictures with orbs in every single one of our apartments, one even
looks like a face is in it. So many things have happened but this email
is long enough. The funny thing is that although it seems to be
following my family, I've never been truly scared, not the normal
reaction I would think I should have considering the circumstances,
it's like it's not evil but it's just there, letting us know it's
there. Thanks for reading this, it feels good to tell someone who
understands.&nbsp; <br>

Off the MAP? A little!<br>
By: jacob.walliser@afghan.swa.army.mil<br>
<br>
Hello im 2nd class petty officer jake walliser of the U.S. Navy
currently stationed out in Bagram Air Base Afghanistan.&nbsp; Im
writing today to say very good job on the site and its listings.&nbsp;
So far a few of us have traveled up and down the west coast at times
over 3 years observing and reviewing all kinds of locations and some
were very intimidating I will not lie.&nbsp; <br>
I'll get to my main body here,&nbsp; the base was obviuosly here well
longer then when we arrived after events on 911.&nbsp; Russians first
constructed this place to head its red armies in power durring the cold
war and then al qieda from there and so forth.&nbsp; A lot of people
were by history either executed or slaughtered in their sleep or while
being tortured so the locals and old folk lore tell us.&nbsp; Most are
sceptical, and some are to embarassed to mention it, but there are
definitely things that give some an experience they'll never forget. <br>
For example and co-worker of mine that was once a big macho guy and,
till this, a non beleiver, was sleeping in his designated 7'X7.5'
living area when&nbsp; only during a certain hour of the early morning
would have that," thick air some one else presence" in his L.A.&nbsp;
He thought nothing of it until the next 2 days past and he awoke with a
heavy hard to breath feeling so naturally it woke him up rather abprupt
and when he opened his eyes he saw a very militarized dark uniformed
figure with pale facial expressions went from standing at the oppostie
side of his cube to lunging twards him making our sailor now ground
pounder very alert and weapon at the ready when then he told me when he
blinked to get a clear view of this threat he noticed this figuresque
thing swiftly take another direction out twards the main exit door of
the living huts as we call them in camp. So he gets up to chase only
find no one as he sticks his head out the cube to identify who or what
was messing with him.&nbsp; The three other men some 2 cubes from his
told him they heard hard pounding boots thumping twards the door but
the door never swung open and they all checked the parimeter and
alerted the camp; there's only one way in or out and that&#8217;s through 2
M16 armed gaurds at all times. :)<br>
later we had asked locals about weird stuff but we came across and old
russki and as it seems our camp area was where a lot of executions were
held during the days of cold war and pre-civil times.&nbsp; So I
thought I'd write this for not only good cause but it should hopefully
be good watercooler subject on a slow day as well.&nbsp; Asking a few
herea and there, there have also been numerous strang encounters in the
only hanger that mother russia kept in one piece that we Coallition
still use vastly today.&nbsp; Its funny watching the air force guys
only going in at night by2's or 3's.<br>

Spirit Attached to Antique Bed<br>
<br>
By: lstrybis@bigpond.net.au<br>
<br>
I recently bought an antique wrought iron bed for my 2yr old girl .To
get her used to sleeping in it, I lay down with her with my back to the
room. <br>
On more than one occasion I have felt someone watching over us. I
thought it was my husband coming in but the door was firmly closed.<br>
&nbsp;I have also felt a prickly goose bump feeling on my arm like I'm
being touched. It only started when I bought the Antique bed which I
was told was late 1800's early 1900's. I was a bit worried about it
all, so i talked to a psychic. She said it was the spirit of a little
old man who once bought the bed for his little girl. He was a kind
spirit who meant no harm. My daughter must have reminded him of his
daughter.&nbsp; The psychic told me to ask the ghost nicely but firmly
to please leave. I did that one night laying with my daughter and
havent felt anything since.<br>

The House in the Mountains<br>
<br>
By: katzata@gmail.com<br>
<br>
Some years back I heard about a haunted house up in some village. It
belonged to a friend of a friend of mine, anyway, we went there cause I
was always curious if those things exist. So when we arrived the house
looked normal nothing out of the ordinary. But there was a little
problem with the electricity and one of the guys had to reconnect the
wires so we'd have power in the house. While he was doing the most
important thing for our stay we started joking around by throwing
little grapes and other harmless stuff at the guy next to our
electrician. At one point we stoped cause we got bored and just as we
stoped a little rock, as big as a 1 cent coin hit the guy who was
working with the wires in the back. Naturally the guy was pissed cause
he may have died if he touched the wires with his hands. The problem
was that neither of us threw the rock, in fact the rock came from the
roof which is impossible cause no one was up on the roof. The roof
itself was practically impossible to get on, on top was like allot less
than 90&deg; angle. For the rest of the day nothing happened except
that I found one plank that had a hand writing "not only them" with
what appeared to be shoe paint. We didn't understand the meaning and i
don't think we needed to. I checked and double checked the house and
everything, and no one i mean no one had access to a thing of this
kind. Later in the evening when we were eating I looked at the window
for no reason just like that, where I saw a white thing passing very
gently almost like gliding in the air. Needles to say that I lost a
little bit of my appetite. Well you can say that at night was when the
"freak show" started (if you can call it like that). We started hearing
noises like stuff being dragged, and of course we went to investigate
but nothing was even touched. As we were down on the first floor (we
chose to sleep on the second floor) we heard a loud bang upstairs. And
when we got to the source it was like impossible, a table that had no
way of opening (cause you need to do some tricks to open it) was open
and one peece was a little far from the table but hay who knows strange
stuff happens all the time. Before going to bed I set booby traps so i
wold know if there's a man or something ghostly. the things i put were
ultra simple a wooden plank which placed on every door (that i s how i
found the plank earlier, I always like to prepare early so i don't get
caught unprepared). At one point we were drunk and started to fall
asleep one by one so we agreed that is better to sleep, and we did.
During the night the plank in my room fell one time bit it was too late
to scare me cause i was still drunk and just cursed once and that was
it, thou nobody walked in. And finally the last thing that happened was
the most annoying thing on earth (at least for me cause when I'm drunk
I don't care who you are and what's your problem but if you wake me up
if I'm sleeping and it's not about something hyper serious then you're
in for a ride) there was a typing on my window even though I was on the
second floor. So i opened the window and started yelling like there was
someone who can be kicked or punched. So eventually I remembered that I
was on the second floor but when i realised it it was like what the
heck nothing happened and nothing will. And that is the end of the
story with the house. After one year we went back to the house again
but to our surprise nothing happened so I'm thinking, if this was a
ghost or something like that i sure scared it out of it's wits. And if
this has been really a ghost that makes me a ghost buster I think.
Thank you for taking your time with my story, and good luck with all
the things that go bump in the night!<br>

Sunken City-San Pedro,CA<br>
<br>
By: youngwetbitches@juno.com<br>
<br>
Hi,my name is Joseph..Ive had many experiences with the paranormal
since I was a young boy,it actually runs in the family..of course the
story I want to share here is that of one I had about a year ago with a
girl I was dating at the time...this took place in San Pedro,CA at the
infamous "Sunken City". It was about 3 a.m. on a weekday and me and my
date had come back from a night of drinking and dancing,she mentioned
this place to me days earlier,and at the moment it seemed like a very
crazy thing to do especially being really buzzed and all..mind you all
I knew was what she told me of this place being home to
murder,suicides,death and whatnots...so we walked along the ridge of
the cliff taking in the lovely view early in the morning,making out
before deciding to take this romantic encounter somewhere more
comforting. As me and her headed back along the dark trail to the
entrance of this forbidden piece of land,I heard the laughter of what
sounded like small children..I recall it distinctly as sounding like a
boy and girl,coming from the paths that lead down to the cliffside
below..i thought it was just my imagination running wild on the
storyline of what I was told.Of course I looked back at her to my right
side,with that look in her eyes as saying I heard that too..we quickly
picked up our pace..as we worked ourselves between the narrow dirt path
that lead from and too..I directed her to walk in front of me with
myself behind.Halfway through I heard footsteps approching behind and
feeling a heavy presence like an energy field imposing itself to my
back,I could not think of anything else but to keep walking...before
hitting the last piece of concrete pillar separating the park and 8-10
foot fence I heard a manly voice sort of laugh/scoff,turning my
shoulder to see I could strongly sense something benevolent on the
other side of that fence staring at me..i shrugged it off,but walking
to our car I stopped my self from asking my date if she had heard
something,before I could finish she asked me if I heard it too,of
course there was no denying it when we both felt the strong urge to
flee since the laughter we heard only a few minutes before...<br>
<br>
That was not the first experience nor will it be the last, of
experiencing disturbing energies at that place..a few weeks later on
April 20(holiday for some), I headed there once again during the day in
the afternoon..this time taking in much a different scenery...taking in
a very shaky like imagery of this cryptic cry of a disturbed and
tainted piece of land...well to get to the point, I left there feeling
very depressed with no apparent explanation...it took me several days
to get over that...Ive been there at least once more time since April
20,I didnt experience anything worth noting,nevertheless,I dont think
less of that place than what it really is,haunted and very
disturbing..especially to those out there whom are more sensitive to
unseen energies than the rest of the general population.I only hope
that anyone who might take interest in this place to venture out there
heed this warning-dont go alone and make sure you know what your
doing.Thank
you!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Three California Surfers Turn Into Scared Little Boys<br>
<br>
By: Wayneroten@aol.com<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The story I'm about to tell is absolutely true and happened not once, but twice on different nights to different people.<br>
It was 1964. Surf ruled in California. I went to Taft High School in
Woodland Hills, California, as did my friends who witnessed this most
extraordinary event.<br>
This was the time of the Beach Boys, hot cars &amp; girls, Santa Ana
winds and the smell of gardenia's in the air on a Summer night.<br>
On this particular night me (Wayne) and my two friends, Bill and Fred,
went to Fred's house to have a couple of beers after a nice day of
surfing. We were all sitting in the living room listening to James
Brown on the record machine, when suddenly the lights began to dim and
the record player slowed down. We weren't frightened, we just thought
something was wrong with the electricity.<br>
The lights began to dim more. Suddenly, we noticed a small glowing
image at the end of Fred's hall. We were like, "What the hell?" Soon
this image grew bigger to the size of a man. Although it looked like
some kind of "see-through" protoplasmic image. I could make out what
looked like an old "street thug"<br>
fron "Hell's Kitchen" in New York. It had an old bowler type hat, a tank top and baggy pants, held up by suspenders.<br>
As it got closer, we noticed "it" had what looked like a small baseball
bat in it's hand, which it kept beating into it's other hand. My friend
Bill said he smelled a real pungent pine scent. I was too freaked out
to notice. Then it spoke and said, "I'm gonna' kill you punks."<br>
Here we are, three "buffed out" strong surfers in the prime of our
lives, who could have easily overpowered this thing. But the vibes it
let off were so evil, we literally ran through a screen door, hopped an
eight foot fence, like it wasn't even there and ran about a mile away.<br>
We came back to Fred's house and everything seemed normal. We decided
not to tell a living soul about the incident for being thought of as
looney tunes.<br>
Fast forward to a week later. Two other friends of mine and Fred, went
to Fred's house to hang out. Their names were Brian and Steve. Steve
was like "our enforcer" at 6'4" 200 lbs. They were sitting around
listening to jazz music, when the same exact event of the previous week
occurred all over. The dimming of the lights, the "ghost," etc. etc.<br>
My other friend and I were at the local taco stand, when all three of
them came screching up in their "souped up" Dodge Ramcharger, screaming
and crying like little girls. I was beside myself and was blown away by
their true fear and honesty.<br>
When I told them of Bill's, Fred's and my same experience, we all drove
back to Fred's to confont this demon from hell. But it wasn't there. We
did, however, see strange shadows streaming through the back yard.<br>
You would expect this sort of thing in an old castle, but this was
Woodland Hills...upper suburbia, new homes, upper middle class, well
bred people.<br>
Then the sightings stopped, but Fred, who lived there turned from a
bright eyed, happy go lucky kid, to an evil drug taking sociopath. I
turned to Buddhism for answers and got them. The last I heard, Fred was
hanging out with the Manson family, but later got his life together and
became a contractor up north.<br>
I hadn't spoken to Bill in 30 years after Viet Nam. I found him in Las
Vegas...doing well. The first thing he said to me on the phone was,
"Wayne...remember that night at Fred's?" We talked for two hours and
ended up still scratching our heads.<br>
It changed all of our lives. After that, we knew that their was some
kind of life after death and that this particular life force died badly
and was angry. There is no way to describe the fear of something you
cannot reason with. We were so scared, we could barely breathe.<br>
Under the penalty of perjury, I swear the following story is true and accurate to the best of my ability. <br>

A Little Ghost Story<br>
<br>
By: Cillianlk@aol.com<br>
<br>
This is a story I tell constantly,&nbsp; This tale happened twenty five
years ago when I was 16.&nbsp; A friend of mine,"Laura" was out with
friends and racing on the streets.&nbsp; She was the passenger and her
head out the window.&nbsp; They crashed and she had terminal
injuries.&nbsp; She lived for three days on life support and during
those days she visited me in my dreams.&nbsp; In one dream she simply
said goodbye.&nbsp; In another she was scared and covered in blood and
screamed "I'm Dead".<br>
Once Laura died she started coming to me in my room.&nbsp; She always
made her presence known at the point of what I call the "twilight of
consciousness".&nbsp; Just as I fell asleep but not quite asleep Laura
would do a variety of things to let her presence known.&nbsp; Slaps,
punches, and sitting on the bed.&nbsp; I was not certain if this was
really happing because of the timing of the attacks.&nbsp; Eventually I
moved out of the room to the attic and that's when things got
interesting.<br>
I had a stop sign that I'm not proud to say I stole.&nbsp; If you could
see these signs up close you would note it is a lot larger than you
would think it would be. Anyway, I put this sign on my wall and used a
4 inch nail.&nbsp; About 2 inches remained out of the wall.&nbsp; That
night I went to sleep and turned off the light.&nbsp; Immediately the
sign started to sway.&nbsp; I couldn't see it but the sound was
distinct.&nbsp; I turned on the light and the sign was still. No
movement at all.&nbsp; I turned off the light and the sound started
again.&nbsp; I turned on the light and again no movement.&nbsp; I was
rattled and got up and went downstairs to calm myself down.&nbsp; I
returned and turned off the light and the sign fell.&nbsp; This was
impossible.....You would have to raise the sign and pull it towards you
over 2 inches of nail.&nbsp; <br>
I made a deal with Laura that stopped her pranks.&nbsp; Every time I
think about her, which is frequent, I say a Hail Mary prayer.&nbsp;
Still Sometimes she says hi in my old room at my Moms house.&nbsp; but
that's a different story.&nbsp; Hope you enjoyed this story.&nbsp; ever
since this happed I feel and sense ghosts. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Clearfield Job Corps Haunting<br>
<br>
By: im_english_baby@yahoo.co.uk<br>
<br>
I once was a student at clearfield job corps, I had stayed in both K dorm and M dorm.<br>
In K dorm I never noticed anything out of ordinary, but when I lived in M dorm, thats when I have noticed things.<br>
At night, a black man would walk the hallways in M dorm. We didn't have
any black male RA's, not to mention I was living in Mormon county.<br>
One night, some friends of mine and I had gotten permission from one of
our RA's Mr. "W." and Ms. "O", to check the ceiling pannels above room
13 by the exit in the back of the dorm.<br>
I was the one to draw the short stick! I went up there with the help of
my friends to give me a boost, I had walked on the 4x4 beabs above for
about 10 feet.<br>
As dark as it was up there, I needed my flashlight, and I looked up at
the ceiling above, and i saw the ending of a knotted rope cut apart. I
didn't see a ghost, but I saw enough to confirm that there was a
hanging! I had also confirmed the hanging story with the RA supervisory
of J, K, L, and M dorm. Mr. "Sparky" replied that rumor had it, and he
wasnt sure.<br>
Also,&nbsp; on campus, by the HONOR DORMS, where the old canteine was
placed, right behind the canteine where the dirt track was, some times
there would be 2 or 3 teenagers running around, and then the next
second they would be gone.<br>
Furthermore, there seemed to be power outages, often. Where the whole campus would be shut down from power.<br>
As far as the movie theatre goes, not once have I ever noticed anything
in the theatre, and I went to the theatre all the time, I had an honor
4 phase card. If i wasnt in the theatre, I was in the gym.<br>
The gym is something else, there isnt much to do on campus when you are
an out of state student with no relatives nearby, so I was also in the
GYM, in the tennis court of the GYM, the lights would also flicker. In
the actual weight room, every now and then, when no one would be in the
GYM, a couple of weights would slam together.<br>
Also, making friends was not a hard thing to do, I had friends in
automotive and advanced, friends in the CNA course, Graphic design, and
Culinary Arts programs.<br>
in the automotive, accidents happen, right. Especially when a car
constantly slams on the ground when suspended in the air by a metal
lift. That re occuring issue seemed to keep on happening.<br>
On the third floor, in the skills room in the health occ course, when
leaving the skills area around 3:45 p.m., when school was out, you
would place the dummies in one part of the room. Upon 8:00 a.m. the
next day, (NO ONE ELSE HAS A KEY, EXCEPT FOR THE INSTRUCTORS, WHO LEAVE
AT 3:45 TOO) the dummies would be moved around.<br>
Graphics design room, there is a stair case to the half second floor,
above the printing machines, NOT ONE STUDENT IS ALLOWED UP THERE, AND
NOT ONE STUDENT IS ALLOWED TO GO NEAR THE STAIRS. One day, i was
visiting a friend in graphic designs, and a piece of paper dropped from
the second&nbsp; floor. I went upstairs to "dig my nose in." No one was
up there.<br>

My Own Experience<br>
<br>
By: Mackdaddybruce64@aol.com<br>
<br>
Hello. my name is Bruce. My experience had happened to me in the summer
of 1984. I was hanging out in the area where I&nbsp; grown up as a
child years before. The house where I had grown up was empty. eight
years earlier my mother had died in the house. One of my chlidhood
friends had even said to me that the house was known to have a ghost in
it. Now me remembering this statement,and being as curious as I am took
advantage of the opprotunity to find out for myself if this could be
possble for ghosts to exist. Well let me tell you that once inside the
house (I had walked through the back door through the kitchen to the
front of the house passing the living room) and up the stairs to my
former bedroom. Then I visited the bedroom of my mother. This is the
room in which she had died. Let me tell you from the moment that I had
went into the house I felt as though I was not alone in this house.
Although I had not physically seen anyone it was like I was sensing a
presence that could not be seen. As I descended the stairs,it felt as
though someone unseen was coming up the stairs simontaniously and had
went right through me. After this I was so glad to get out of the house
and after this I had never had the inbterest to return to the house of
my childhood. This is a minor experience but it has changed my
perception of the existance of the spirit world. I now believe in
ghosts. Although I did not feel endangered by the unseen presence but I
was scared non the same. <br>

Ghostly Experiences<br>
<br>

I actually have had quite a few eerie things happen to me in my
lifetime, but two of them stand out from the rest.&nbsp; The first was
36 years ago, when my husband was assigned to Wright-Patterson AFB,
OH.&nbsp; I was pregnant with our second child and we had moved into
base housing.&nbsp; As I unpacked our belongings one day while my
husband was at work and my oldest son in school, a radio sitting on the
opposite side of the room all of a sudden came on, played for a while,
then went off, all by itself.&nbsp; Shortly after, as I sat resting on
the couch, there were HEAVY footsteps going up the stairs, which were
about 4-5 feet away from me.&nbsp; It sounded like a 200 pound man
stomping all the way up the stairs.&nbsp; I sat there looking at the
stairs until the sound stopped.&nbsp; There was one stair about 3-4
steps down from the top that always squeaked when we stepped on it, and
it did indeed squeak as I listened to these footsteps climb
upwards.&nbsp; In the same apartment, my husband and I both noticed a
'buzzing' sound that seemed to be coming out of the walls at night, and
we had wondered what it could possibly be.&nbsp; A couple of weeks
later, we were sitting outside in lawn chairs visiting with our
neighbors, when I asked a couple of the ladies if they had any idea
what the buzzing sound was that we heard at night.&nbsp; They looked at
each other with a stunned expression then one of them said "We don't
know whether we should tell you this or not".&nbsp; I answered that I
wanted to know.&nbsp; They then told me that the family that had lived
in the apartment before us had a 12 year old boy.&nbsp; This boy was
petrified to go into the bathroom upstairs and he said that he could
hear 'them' coming after him with electric saws.&nbsp; His parents took
him to the doctor, put him on medication, to no avail, and finally he
became so hysterical that they had to move out of the military
housing.&nbsp; I have to say I always felt eerie when I was in the
bathroom, and didn't like to go in there.&nbsp; Other than the eerie
feelings, there were no more unsettling incidents as long as we lived
there.&nbsp; The other story I want to tell took place about 6 years
later, when we were living overseas in the Azores, Portugal.&nbsp; I
had a chance to go to a TOPS (Take Off Pounds Slowly) convention in
Berchtesgaden, Germany.&nbsp; A group of us flew over on a military
plane, and one of my friends from the Azores and I shared a room in the
General Walker Hotel, in the German Alps, which was very close to the
Germany-Austrian border and had a spectacular view into Austria.&nbsp;
Eva Braun's little house was just down the hillside from the main
hotel.&nbsp; This hotel has since been demolished, but it had a very
interesting history behind it.&nbsp; It had been the wartime hideout
and vacation site to Adolf Hitler, and he even wrote some of his book
"Mein Kampf" (sp?) there.&nbsp; There were military bunkers beneath the
hotel where the top brass went for safety from attack.&nbsp; At another
point in history, it was a hospital, and there were facilities nearby
where attack dogs were kept, to guard prisoners.&nbsp; The famous
"Eagle's Nest" was in sight from the hotel, where Hitler had built a
home high on the mountaintop, and would meet with his top
officers.&nbsp; When it was discovered that Hitler frequented this
area, the British heavily bombed the town and one can still see little
frog pounds in the mountains (same area where Song of Music was filmed)
that are actually bomb craters.&nbsp; Anyway - I sensed something
'evil' or creepy in the room we had from the first moment we walked
into it.&nbsp; On the second night of our stay, we had gone down to a
small hotel club to visit with some of the other guests.&nbsp; I had a
headache and told my roommate I was going to go back up to the room and
go on to bed.&nbsp; No sooner had I gotten into the bed than I heard a
'clink' from the area of the bathroom sink, where there were two metal
glass holders on the wall, on either side of the sink.&nbsp; It
startled me a little, but I figured it was someone in the room next
door, bumping into the wall.&nbsp; I closed my eyes again, and all of a
sudden, it was as though someone had picked up one of the glasses and
slammed it back into the holder.&nbsp; I laid there looking at the
area, knowing there was something very evil, foreboding and dangerous
standing right in front of the door, looking at me.&nbsp; I could see
nothing with my eyes, but the fear and the knowledge that something was
there was so overwhelming and definite that I could not move, even
though I wanted so badly to run out of the room.&nbsp; But I would have
had to run through the area where I knew something very frightening was
standing.&nbsp; All I could do was pray for safety.&nbsp; I have never
had that feeling before or since, and hope I never do again!&nbsp;
After a few minutes, my roommate came back to the room, and with a
great feeling of relief, I dropped off to sleep within a few
minutes.&nbsp; The next morning as we had breakfast, I told her about
what had happened in the room before she returned the night before, and
she told me that after she had gotten into her bed, at which time I was
asleep, she heard keys moving around on top of the dresser, which was
at the foot of the beds.&nbsp; Thinking I was up doing something, she
opened her eyes to see what I was doing, only to find that I was still
in my bed and no-one was close to the dresser.&nbsp; I was glad that we
were to return home the next day, as I would not have wanted to spend
another night in that room!!&nbsp; With all the evil deeds that were
done in that building, as well as all the souls who suffered wounds and
illness and died there, it's not surprising that something of this
nature would happen.&nbsp; Interestingly, I didn't really know much
about the history of the hotel before our arrival, so I don't believe
it was my mind playing tricks, or expecting something to happen.<br>

A Dream House or Nightmare Mansion?<br>
<br>
By: vony_b@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
Last year, my family and I moved from our previous residence. When we
first moved in, we thought it was our dream house and we enjoyed it.
The house was spacious and it was really comfortable. About three
months after we moved in, strange things began to happen. Things would
disapear suddenly then reapear the next minute. At first, we just
ignored it, then after ahwile it got harder and harder to ignore. One
day, I was in my room about to goto sleep when all of a sudden, I saw
glowing red eyes on my closet door. I got scared and ran into my mom's
room and told her what I saw. She came back in with me (and of course,
they were gone). That night, I tried to sleep but was unable to. Thats
when I saw it for the first time; a tall dark hooded figure standing
right infront of my closet staring right at me! I put my head under the
covers and then looked again (and it was still there). The next day, I
told my mom what happened. The following months to come, even worse
things began to happen. We began to hear running footsteps (and we
wouldnt be walking or anything!) and we also heard voices. Aparently,
one of the spirits did not like children because it continuosly abused
my brother and I. We talked to the agent that sold us the house and
learned that the house had been abandoned for eight years. This is due
to it being a trasport house (familys waiting to be taken to a forign
country). We also learned that a family died in that house as well. A
year later, we moved out. I dont know how the new owners are fairing
with the property, but in my own view, I would never want to live there
ever again. <br>

Haunted Private Residence<br>
<br>
By: Anonymous<br>
<br>
<br>
My family moved around quite a bit when I was a youngster.&nbsp; One of
the houses we moved to was on SOUTH 3RD STREET in Jonesborough,
TN.&nbsp; We often talked to the lady who owned the house when she came
by monthly for the rent.&nbsp; As time went by she gradually revealed
tidbits of rumor and legend about the house being haunted.&nbsp; No one
really believed her tales, but it was a chilling, ghoulish delight to
listen to her.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After we had lived there for a year or
so, in 1964 or '65 my father became prone to grand mal epileptic
seizures.&nbsp; When he started having one, my mother, bless her soul,
would 'freak out' and head out the door screaming...which left ME there
to nurse him as best I could.&nbsp; I was only 10 or 11 years old, and
this became quite a burden for me.&nbsp; The only thing the doctors
recommended was to just make him as comfortable as possible and let the
seizure run its course.&nbsp; Naturally, this made my mother and me
nervous wrecks.&nbsp; She could not stand to sleep in the same room as
him, so she slept in my bedroom which was right next to his.&nbsp; The
tiniest squeak of his bedsprings at night would send our pulses racing,
and we would hold our breaths to see if the tiny squeak became a chorus
of thrashing and thumping.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More often than not, he
would just be turning over in his sleep.&nbsp; <br>
One warm summer night in particular, Mom and I were just getting to bed
when she asked me if I remembered to latch the screen.&nbsp; (We had no
a/c and commonly left the doors open with the screen
latched).&nbsp;&nbsp; I told her I remembered doing so, but she did not
feel comfortable about it and wanted me to go check.&nbsp; I
reluctantly got up out of the bed and walked barefoot across the floor
to check the screen door.&nbsp; While I turned to go back to bed, I
opened my mouth to tell Mom that everything was fine, but no words came
out...I stared at the floor where I had just walked from the bed to
where I now stood, and there were at least 12 little footprints
outlined across the floor.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mesermized, I asked Mom to look
at the floor, and she asked 'why?', I just told her the door WAS
locked, but I needed her to LOOK at the floor.&nbsp; She raised up in
the bed and looked, although I could barely discern her shape in the
bed, I could tell she was frozen in place.&nbsp; She asked me if there
were lightning bugs on the floor...maybe I'd stepped on some lightning
bugs...&nbsp;&nbsp; I told her I didn't think so, but I flipped on the
light switch at my shoulder, and ... there was nothing
there.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
I asked mother if she had indeed seen the footprints, and she replied
that she had, but that there HAD to be a reasonable explanation for
them... It is now over 40 years later, and it has never been
explained.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
Weeks later, I was walking from our kitchen through this same bedroom,
heading out to the front porch where everyone was sitting around
talking.&nbsp; I carried a nice big glass of ice tea and happened to
look over at the wood stove which hadn't been in use in months.&nbsp;
The area where the stovepipe entered the chimney was surrounded by a
big sheet of asbestos that had wallpaper over it.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
activity that had caught my eye was a 6" circle of flame that appeared
to be fanned by some VERY hot accelerant.&nbsp; I yelled out the front
door that there was a fire in there, and most of my family hurried
inside to witness the rapidly spreading flame.&nbsp; By the time my
brother and father got the fire out it had burned an area of at least
2' by 4' and was almost to the ceiling.&nbsp;&nbsp; No one had been in
there but me, and I KNOW I did nothing to start it, it being at least 4
or 5 foot above my head...but no one could ever find the cause of the
fire, let alone why the asbestos itself burned with only the heat of a
thin bit of wallpaper to start it...<br>
We didn't stay in this house very much longer.&nbsp; My father
eventually had a massive brain hemmorhage and was institutionalized for
several months and when he was able to come home, we had a different
rental.&nbsp; The house is still standing and I've often wanted to stop
by and talk to the current inhabitants to see if they have had any
occurances.&nbsp; MY thoughts since then are that it could have been
poltergiest activity; which is known to occur in adolescent children,
mainly girls who are under a great amount of stress.&nbsp;&nbsp;
(((?))) Who knows??<br>

Angels Among Us - The Story of Little Gary<br>
<br>
By: crazy_ray85@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
On June 5, 1985, my sister gave birth to her third child and only son,
a baby she named Gary Albert, after his father, The baby already had so
much against him from the start. He was born at six months gestation
and had severe congenital defects including spina bifida and a reversed
heart with holes in it (not sure what the medical condition is called).
The pediatrician gave him only a month at most to live, but Gary was a
fighter. He lived for almost six, passing away on November 29, 1985. I
have reason, however, to believe that Gary is still alive in a
spiritual sense. Over the past 18+ years, his family has spoken of the
"little boy" who seemed to follow them wherever they moved. I decided
for myself that Gary was following his Earth family wherever they went
because he never got the chance to come home from the hospital as his
sisters all had. Also, just last year, my sister and her youngest
daughter (born three years after Gary) moved out of their apartment to
come live with us for a little while, and among her most treasured
posessions she took with her was the memory box with all of Gary's old
clothes and toys, and even his obituary in it. Once she was all moved
in, she packed the precious box away in a safe place. A couple of
months later, she received a call from the landlady who ran the
apartment complex. She said that my sister had left a box behind in a
closet when she and her daughter had moved. My sister went by to
retrieve the box later that day, and to her surprise it was GARY'S
MEMORY BOX!!! The lady said my sister was lucly to get it back, because
she was about to throw it away. What was so astonishing about all of
this besides the box itself was that it was found in the youngest
daughter's closet, and she had been in an abusive relationship at the
time. This tells me that Gary was looking out for his little sister,
whom he had never had the chance to meet. He was telling his mom to
watch her closely. She has since broken up with the abusive boyfriend. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another thing that happened took place last
summer,&nbsp; when I had a severe asthma attack at work. I found myself
stuggling to breathe and wanting to just give up because the attack was
physically draining me of my strengh (as they often do). While I was
waiting for another sister to bring her inhaler (mine was empty.
Wonderful timing, eh?) I heard a voice say to me, "Hold on, Rachel.
Everything is going to be alright. Margaret's coming with the inhaler,
and you'll be just fine." The voice sounded so much like my sister who
had lost Gary so long ago (this took place around what would have been
his 21st birthday), only it was deeper and sounded male. I believe it
was Gary, and that he was staying with me until help arrived. I feel a
connection with him, as he would have been just three months older than
me, and I claim him as my nephew even though we never really met face
to face (save a dream I had about him when we both would have been 10)
and he died 5 years before I was finally adopted into my family. I
believe that since I'm willing to keep his memory alive, he will live
in our hearts forever.<br>
