<P><B>Young Experiences</B>

<P><B>By: tariq-ali@cadarn.co.uk</B>

<P><B>Hi my name is Tariq, my supernatural experience happened to me when
I was</B>
<BR><B>about 5 or 6 years old.</B>
<BR><B>I seem to remember it was quite a sunny afternoon, nothing particularly</B>
<BR><B>unusual about that day.</B>
<BR><B>My mother asked me to go upstairs and awake my father who often
took</B>
<BR><B>afternoon naps, I remember feeling quite lazy and I could not realy
be</B>
<BR><B>bothered going all the way upstairs&nbsp; to atteempt tp wake my
deep sleeping</B>
<BR><B>father, however my mum insisted so I did.</B>
<BR><B>I was about to walk up the stairs when I was suddenly overcome with
fear as</B>
<BR><B>what I had saw made no sense to me,&nbsp; there at the top of the
stairs was the</B>
<BR><B>biggest dog I had ever seen in my life, it appeared to fill the
whole space</B>
<BR><B>of the landing and was near the height of the cieling.</B>
<BR><B>The dog appeared to be agressive and was barking and growling loud
it could</B>
<BR><B>of woke the dead, I was froze to spot, I shouted for mum, I said
mum I</B>
<BR><B>cannot go upstairs, she told me not to be lazy, I told her there
was this</B>
<BR><B>big dog at the top of the stairs and it will not let me pass, my
mum came</B>
<BR><B>out and said but Tariq we do not have a dog, of course I knew.&nbsp;
So there was</B>
<BR><B>my mum and I stood staring at the top of stairs, but&nbsp; the strange
thing was</B>
<BR><B>she could not see it or even hear it, I was&nbsp; pointing&nbsp;
frantically at it ,</B>
<BR><B>the dogs bark was deafening but still although she was looking directly
at</B>
<BR><B>it&nbsp; she saw nothing.</B>
<BR><B>This confused me even more ,being the age I was I could understand
it , I</B>
<BR><B>started to doubt even if I was seeing it at all, as trusted and
believed in</B>
<BR><B>my mother, so if she did not see it maybe it was not really there.</B>
<BR><B>Eventually the dog dissappeared and I forgot about it, however these</B>
<BR><B>memories came back when I was about 12 years old and I spoke to
my mum about</B>
<BR><B>it and she did remember the incident.</B>
<BR><B>Looking back on it I do believe I did see something supernatural,
but any</B>
<BR><B>ideas on why mum or dad could not see or hear it, and why was the
dog being</B>
<BR><B>so protective.</B>

<BR><B>Unsure Of</B>

<P><B>By: lhoward_947@msn.com</B>

<P><B>I recently had an experience that i can't explain, and decided to
tell my story here.</B>
<BR><B>In June, my boyfriend, Ian, our (then) 15 month old twins and I
went to Virginia for his family reunion.&nbsp;&nbsp; While we were there,
we had a wonderful time meeting his family and getting to know everyone
really well.&nbsp; We stayed at his father and step mothers home with the
immediate family.&nbsp; One night, while everyone was asleep, one of the
girls started crying.&nbsp; (most likely from being in a new place or losing
her pacifier.)&nbsp; I woke up and still groggy, i sat up in the bed.&nbsp;
I looked over to the crib.&nbsp; Next to the crib, there was an little
old woman standing there looking into the crib.&nbsp; When I saw her, she
didn't scare me, and I thought nothing of it.&nbsp; She looked at me, put
her finger up to her mouth, kind of bent down, and whispered, "shhh...
she'll go back to sleep in a minute."&nbsp; so, I laid back down and fell
back to sleep.&nbsp; Brianah slept through the rest of the night.&nbsp;
The next morning, I got up, and remembered what I saw.&nbsp; Not sure if
i dreamt it or not, I pulled Ian away from the family and asked him if
he had a picture of his grandmother.&nbsp; (The family had spoken alot
of her the previous day at the reunion, but i had never met her.)&nbsp;
Ian was very close to her, and was very upset at the time of her death.&nbsp;
(it would've been almost 9 yrs ago.)&nbsp; They found one,&nbsp; and after
I saw the picture, I felt this "warmth"&nbsp; (the only way i can describe
it) fill my body.&nbsp; It was the lady I saw the night before.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I wasn't sure if I should tell anyone, for fear of them thinking I was
insane.&nbsp; But, I decided to tell Ian.&nbsp;&nbsp; When I told him,
he kind of gasped.&nbsp; Like i said, he was very close to his grandmother.&nbsp;
I'm glad I told him.&nbsp; But later, as we were talking to the family,&nbsp;
someone said, " oh, it would've been so wonderful for her to be here and
see all of the family together."&nbsp; (speaking of the grandmother.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Ian looked at me, and asked me to tell everyone what I saw.&nbsp; I'm still
new to this family and wouldn't want to be dubbed as "the crazy one" just
yet... lol... We kept it to ourselves.</B>
<BR><B>thanks for giving me a place to share this.</B>

<BR><B>The House on Shiloh Street</B>

<P><B>By: whistledixie@mail.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>

<P><B>In 1983, we moved into a home that had suddenly been vacated by the
owners.&nbsp; The man had suffered a heart attack at the front door and
died.&nbsp; His wife went into serious shock and suffered some emotional
distress.&nbsp; After the funeral, her children decided to take her back
to Missouri.</B>
<BR><B>I had personally known the couple in 1971, as I had lived in a house
on the connecting street.&nbsp;&nbsp; Our backyards were contiguous.&nbsp;
Mr. Williams had been the Water Superintendent for the city for many years.</B>
<BR><B>He was an upstanding citizen, a loving family man and a friend to
many people.</B>
<BR><B>Shortly after moving in, we got the feeling that Mr. Williams had
never really left his home.&nbsp; At night, after everyone had turned in,
footsteps could be heard throughout the home.&nbsp; It sounded like heavy
footsteps stomping up and down the hall outside the bedrooms.&nbsp; I would
get up and check to see if the children were awake, and would find them
sleeping soundly in their beds.</B>
<BR><B>Once in a while, doors would open up wide as if someone was entering
a room, and then the door would slam shut.</B>
<BR><B>One night, my wife at the time awoke to see the form of a man standing
at the end of our bed.&nbsp; He moved up on her side and leaned over a
little.&nbsp; She lay there terrified, knowing that I was very hard to
wake up, and that if this were a burglar, I would not suddenly spring into
action against the intruder.&nbsp;&nbsp; She maintained her position and
just peered through her eyelids.&nbsp; Suddenly, the figure just faded
away.</B>
<BR><B>These occurrences persisted for about a month.&nbsp;&nbsp; One morning
at around 2:30 am we were suddenly awakened by the bedroom door slamming
open with a violent force.&nbsp; We were very tired of Mr. Willams' nightly
tirades, and I was running on my last nerve.&nbsp; I got up and decided
to try to talk with this confused soul.&nbsp; I addressed him as Mr. Williams,
and told him that he had suffered a heart attack and had died.&nbsp; I
told him that his wife had gone to Missouri to live with his children.&nbsp;
I told him that we were paying rent to his children to live in this house,
and we worked hard for our money.&nbsp; I started to get angry with him
and told him that if he wanted to rant and rave and stomp about the home,
he needed to do it when we weren't there, as he was disturbing our sleep.&nbsp;
If he continued, we would be forced to move, and his children would have
to find other renters.&nbsp; I suggested he go to Missouri because that
is where he would find his wife.</B>
<BR><B>After that, we never heard from Mr. Williams again.</B>

<P><B>The Little Girl of Fort Concho</B>

<P><B>In August of 1997, I was helping a friend deliver some things for
a post-funeral reception that was to be held in the Officers' Quarters
Number One, at Fort Concho, in San Angelo, Texas.&nbsp;&nbsp; Fort Concho
is the best-preserved and reconstructed cavalry fort in America.&nbsp;
This is where the buffalo soldiers were stationed.</B>
<BR><B>It was very early in the morning, and we had to get the key to the
building from the curator.&nbsp; We drove to the other side of the parade
ground and parked the van.&nbsp; We went inside and I took some things
up the staircase to the second floor, while my buddy worked on the first
floor.&nbsp; I walked into the west bedroom upstairs and immediately felt
like I had just walked between two people that were standing shoulder to
shoulder.&nbsp; I was walking into a tremendous field of static electricity.&nbsp;
I had a cold sensation, and the hairs on my neck and arms stood straight
out.&nbsp; I put the vase down that I was carrying and found myself</B>
<BR><B>compelled to say, &amp;quot;Excuse me.&amp;quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then
I proceeded to the east bedroom.&nbsp; When I entered the room, I saw a
little girl out of the corner of my eye, playing on the floor to my left.&nbsp;
I placed the vase and when I turned around, she faded away.</B>
<BR><B>A couple of days later I was again with my friend and we stopped
by the house of the lady who was responsible for financing the restoration
of Officers' Quarters Number One.&nbsp; My friend mentioned that I had
felt a presence and saw a little girl.&nbsp; I told her that I had seen
her in the east bedroom and she told me that a little girl had died in
that very room.&nbsp; Maybe it was her parents that I felt in the west
bedroom, or just someone else watching over her.</B>
<BR><B>A few months later, I had the opportunity to stop by Officers' Quarters
Number One when it was open to the public.&nbsp; I was walking around and
a staff volunteer came up and asked me what I thought of the building.&nbsp;
I told her I thought it was haunted, and repeated the story of the little
girl.&nbsp; The lady took me into the dining room and pointed to a portrait
on the wall.&nbsp; It was the same little girl I had seen upstairs.</B>

<P><B>The Boy in the Red Cap</B>

<P><B>By:qdegozaru@yahoo.com</B>
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B>I used to bicycle the four miles to and from work</B>
<BR><B>along the main road connecting two towns in a part of</B>
<BR><B>southern Japan. Along the way, there were rice fields</B>
<BR><B>on both sides of the road, shops of many kinds, a</B>
<BR><B>school or two, and quite a number of houses set back</B>
<BR><B>only about ten or fifteen feet from the sidewalk.</B>
<BR><B>One evening in winter around seven-thirty I was</B>
<BR><B>bicycling toward home and passed by several homes in a</B>
<BR><B>row along the left side of the road. One of them was a</B>
<BR><B>one-story wooden farm house that had a long, low</B>
<BR><B>facade with several square beam columns holding up the</B>
<BR><B>roof over the entranceway. As I neared this house, I</B>
<BR><B>noticed that there was a boy of perhaps ten years old</B>
<BR><B>standing behind one of the columns, partially obscured</B>
<BR><B>by it. He was clearly wearing shorts (it is not</B>
<BR><B>unusual for boys to wear shorts all year long in</B>
<BR><B>relatively warm southern Japan) and a long-sleeved</B>
<BR><B>t-shirt and most notably a red baseball cap. As I got</B>
<BR><B>even nearer and passed in front of where the boy was</B>
<BR><B>standing, I spotted him again, this time just a few</B>
<BR><B>feet away from me, and I noticed that where his face</B>
<BR><B>should have been, there was just a blur: a somewhat</B>
<BR><B>dark flesh-toned blur, but no visible features. This,</B>
<BR><B>quite naturally, shocked me and just after I passed on</B>
<BR><B>my bicycle, I looked back over my shoulder at the</B>
<BR><B>place where he had been standing. He was no longer</B>
<BR><B>there, though there clearly was not enough time for</B>
<BR><B>him to have moved so quickly that I wouldn't have seen</B>
<BR><B>him. I had chills during the rest of my way back home.</B>
<BR><B>The next day, I told the people at my office what I</B>
<BR><B>had seen the night before, and one of the older (upper</B>
<BR><B>50's) women told me that that stretch of road was</B>
<BR><B>notorious for fatal car accidents, most involving</B>
<BR><B>children who dart into the street after a ball or some</B>
<BR><B>other toy. I suppose that to most readers this sounds</B>
<BR><B>like a fairly typical ghost sighting story, but it is</B>
<BR><B>the only time I have ever personally seen what I can</B>
<BR><B>only conclude was a ghost, so it has had quite a deep</B>
<BR><B>impact on me.</B>
<BR><B>Though I worked at that same job for more than a year</B>
<BR><B>after the sighting and bicycled to a from work along</B>
<BR><B>the same road almost every day during that time, I</B>
<BR><B>never again saw the boy in the red cap.</B>

<BR><B>True Ghost Experience</B>

<P><B>By: LutherKe@aol.com</B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One night I was laying in my and couldn't
get to sleep.&nbsp; So, I got up</B>
<BR><B>and went to my living room and sat on the couch.&nbsp; I didn't
turn on the TV.</B>
<BR><B>Instead I desided to just sit there and collect my thoughts.&nbsp;
Then it was</B>
<BR><B>about 10:30 when I looked near my front door because I thought something
was</B>
<BR><B>watching me.&nbsp; Then a transparent figure was standing 5 feet
from the door and</B>
<BR><B>it walked about 3 ft. to my other couch right in front of me.&nbsp;
It was a</B>
<BR><B>female, 5ft. 7in., in 60's clothes.&nbsp; She had&nbsp; yellow bellbottom
pants on and</B>
<BR><B>a yellow sweater with brown shoes.&nbsp; She then took one look
at me and</B>
<BR><B>disappeared.&nbsp; For some reason I wasn't scared, instead I just
sat there with</B>
<BR><B>my jaw wide open.&nbsp; I've always believed in the paranormal and
ghosts, but</B>
<BR><B>this made me really know that we are not alone.</B>

she showed</B>

<P><B>Bedford - Jean Bonnet Inn</B>

<P><B>By: Anonymous</B>

<P><B>Description of Haunting: This particular Inn has been around since
the Revolutionary War. The building has not gone threw any major changes
except renovations in the late 1800s. The Building was built for Gen. Forbes.
This is also where he killed on of his men for being a spy. They buried
him under the building itself. Through out the years the land was sold
off and given away for debts. Later in the early 1800s, it was remolded
and made into a Monthly Court house. This was when a counsel would meet
and view ideas. But mostly it was used for hanging thieves, and murders.
This was conformed in 1950 when they dug the ground and found people wear
not only Revolutionary clothing, but also Civil war clothing.</B>
<BR><B>This place has been renamed and has also been used for many things.
I was o so lucky to have visited this place a number of times. When I was
about 12 years old, My parents, and step brother and I went to this place
to eat. It was a wonderful place. Old style dinning area, and wonderful
smells of food cooking. The most noticeable thing I remember is the fire
place. This is an old building. Very old. Which has no conventional heat.
All the heat comes from Fire places, which are located in almost every
room. There was also beautiful quilts laid on the walls. One I noticed,
for how big the fire place was and How cold it was. we were sitting about
10 feet away from this place. There seemed to be a constant draft. I also
forgot to mention, the dinning area is in the basement. there are no windows.
my step father said it might be a back draft from the fire place. I would
of believed this, if it wasn't for the fact that it was coming from behind
the quilt. I pulled the!</B>
<BR><B>quilt out to see if there was a small hole, that some one was trying
to cover up, or maybe even a tiny window. nothing! Threw out diner there
would be cold spots that seemed to move around mostly behind the back of
my neck. This is what I remember the most. I was not terrible cold, but
I did feel like some one had brushed up against me and was breathing cold
air down my neck. The hairs on my right arm stood up. this was scary for
me. I was uneasy feeling. I did not want to go back but like I always do,
I did.</B>
<BR><B>The next time was not as bad it was late July it was very nice out.
This was also when I was about 17. My brother and I again, were there with
my parents and their friends. My brother and I were out side smoking, when
We thought we saw someone shining a light bulb out of the top window which
sometimes was rented out. I looked at Dave and asked if he had seen that.
We thought. No offence, a redneck messing around.</B>
<BR><B>When we looked up the blind was down and didn’t seem to be moving
in any way, shape or form. You would think that it would be moving or shaken
if dropped to fast. That night nothing else happened.</B>
<BR><B>It has not been till recently, until I found out all about the building
from a book named Pennsylvania Haunted Places, Vol. II. there are three
books in the set.</B>
<BR><B>A group of people in the Central Pennsylvania Paranormal society,
was invited by the owner who had been having problems keeping staff members.
When the group arrived they were surprised at the rush of energy. Lights
blinked, batteries went dead, and cameras and other equipment did not work.
The temp. went down 15 degrees. there was a smell in the air no one could
identify. Threw out the night members of the party would become ill, lightheaded
and felt odd cold spots. One of which sounds quite like what I had happen
to me.</B>
<BR><B>one of the members, was sitting at the bar when all of a sudden
a cold spot was on his ear. He reach up and put his hand in a cold spot
that was about 5 inches across and 7 inches long. a head. there was a ghost
sitting beside him, he turned the tape recorder on and then took a picture.
The pictures in the book showed an orb about 1/2 centimeter from his head
and the recorder went dead.</B>
<BR><B>Most of went on in the building happened many other times to people
that have gone there. Many people say they see a young man in dirty clothes
and a old leather hat. Could it be one of the hanging victims? Other people
say they see people in blue uniforms, Could this be the spy, and there
is even a small child and woman who seem to be fond of the place. this
could be a story of a woman that was kept in the building when it was known
as the plantation house. but no one knows. I will be going back to this
place, with a digital camera and slow speed. If you would like to see the
results please get back to me.</B>

<P><B>7 Year Haunt</B>

<P><B>I lived an apartment that I believe was haunted.&nbsp; I lived in
this place for 7 years.&nbsp; The first month I moved in our stereo system
was on a small stand and the stand began to sway.&nbsp; It has been many
years since then but boy I have never forgot!&nbsp; One day 3 shades all
went up at the same time during the day!&nbsp;&nbsp; 2 in the kitchen one
in the living room!&nbsp; All at the same time to weird.&nbsp; My son woke
up one night saying he saw some one........</B>
<BR><B>In my bedroom there were many experiences.&nbsp; What would happen
is I had a chinese upbrella as a lamp shade on the ceiling, that would
spin like crazy...........you could feel something float above you and
my bed would sway back and forth.&nbsp; One night me and my X-husband remembered
this night, the bed swayed and I asked him "are you doing this?" he replied
"No I thought you were".&nbsp; In the dead of winter with no wind to blow
the curtains blew as if a summer breeze was blowing in (mind you had storm
windows with plastic over them) the chinese umbrella spun like crazy chest
of draws shook.&nbsp; Many years we lived with a spirit.</B>

road and there was a stench of death....horrible smell........I wanted
to go back down this road we did.&nbsp; The smell was gone but at the other
end was smell of pumpkin like fall smell something sweet cooking.&nbsp;
This was the remains of a prison camp in MA.</B>

<BR><B>Things That I Have Seen</B>

<P><B>By: stardune@bellsouth.net</B>

<P><B>Story 1:</B>

<P><B>I think I was around ten when this happend. My mom and I was living
in a two story apartment. We lived on the first 2nd floor. I was playing
with my toys in the middle of a long hallway in the apartment. Used plastic
army men, Transformers, and some others. While I was playing, I felt a
strange feeling so I turned my head and a little behind me was a figure
all in black with a hat and trench coat. EVERYTHING about the figure was
black....like a shadow. I jumped up and ran away down the hall. (About
ten feet) I looked back and it was gone. After looking around the corner
and seeing nothing, I went back to playing with my toys like nothing happend.
The thing I remeber today was the over rideing sense of fear.</B>
<BR><B>2nd story:</B>
<BR><B>Years later. My mom god married and we moved out. The day after
we moved the apartment burnt down because of the crack head down stairs.
Anyway. We had a Cat named Cleo. (We've had her for many years.) Well,
we all moved out to live with my step-dad. Cleo hated him..:) Anyway. My
mom went away for a week to see her parents. It was just me, cleo, and
my step-dad. The last time I saw Cleo, she came to my room and try to snuggle
up to me. I was busy so I pushed her away.She left. Then I didn't see her
for 3 days. My step dad called my mom about it and she was worried. So
was I..I loved Cleo. Well, I was setting at a table when I heard a "Meow"
I looked at my step-dad and said "Did you hear that?!" My step-dad said
no. Just then I heard the meow again!!! I hurridy got up from the table,
went out the back door,opend the back fence that let to the side of the
house and saw her. She was dead and looked very stiff. She had been dead
for awhile. I ran back and told my step-dad. I was in tears. My step-dad
put cleo in a plastic garbage back and threw her away. Luckly my mom came
back the next day and TOLD him to burry her. He did. I remember siting
next to her grave in the back yard and talking to her.</B>
<BR><B>My mom thinks one of the neabors poisend her or she died of lonelyness.(My
step dad didn't like cats, I ignored her most of the time becasue of my
teen years and mom was away.) I think she died because she was getting
old and she was unheathly fat. But I think back and I am sadden that maybe
she was trying to say good-bye and I pushed her away. Moral: Always love
your pets.</B>
<BR><B>3rd story: This isn't a story but it happend from time to time.
I see what looks like to be black electricity. I was open the passanger
door to my truck to let my girlfriend in, when I saw what looked like a
ball of black lightning comeing towards my legs. I instinctively jumped
so the black ball of lighting wouln't hit me. My girlfriend asked what
was the matter and I asked her "Did you see that?!" She said no. I shook
my head and continued on what I was doing. This has happend a few times
over the years. The Wicca friends I used to hang out with told me I was
more attuned with the occult and the paranormal.</B>

<BR><B>that she had red eyes. i didn't know if she saw me or</B>
<BR><B>what so i just closed my eyes and recited the "our</B>
<BR><B>father" prayer. i thought that when i open my eyes,</B>
<BR><B>she'd be gone but when i did open my eyes, to my great</B>
<BR><B>surprise and horror, she was right infront of me! but</B>
<BR><B>i continued saying my prayer and what really get into</B>

<BR><B>The Whaley House (Old Towne San Diego)</B>

<P><B>By: Dianewarman@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>Hi, It has been years since I have been in the Waley House.&nbsp;
I do not plan to</B>
<BR><B>go back and time soon.&nbsp; The reason is I had experiences the
both times I</B>
<BR><B>visited the house.&nbsp; The first time I was part of a Leadership
conference with</B>
<BR><B>Cerritos Community College, and one of our outing was visiting the
Waley</B>
<BR><B>House.&nbsp; When I was touring the house I noticed curtains moving
when there was</B>
<BR><B>not a breeze in the house.&nbsp; The feeling that I was being watched.&nbsp;
I also had</B>
<BR><B>the feeling that someone had their hand on my shoulder. I also could
not</B>
<BR><B>escape the feeling the sadness.&nbsp; I felt like my very being
was being pushed</B>
<BR><B>in the a great hole. This was a very frightening feeling.</B>
<BR><B>In my next visit I decided to stay in the court room and watch the
video. I</B>
<BR><B>was in the room alone sitting about 3 rows back.&nbsp; While sitting
there I heard</B>
<BR><B>the door open and people walk in.&nbsp; I also heard a small dog
walking around.</B>
<BR><B>This dog actually walked behind me and touched me on the legs (
I had on</B>
<BR><B>shorts).&nbsp; When the video finished I got up to leave. The was
no one else in</B>
<BR><B>the room with me.</B>
<BR><B>For that reason I will never return to the house.</B>

<P><B>The Snake Lady</B>

<P><B>By: Dccswrtd@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>I first would like to say I was not a believer in ghosts or spirits.&nbsp;
I was</B>
<BR><B>in the navy at the time and had just been transferred to Sasebo
Japan.&nbsp; My</B>
<BR><B>family and I&nbsp; arrived there in August of 91.&nbsp; I felt lucky
because the Navy</B>
<BR><B>had just opened&nbsp; Hario, a new housing complex about 9 miles
from the naval</B>
<BR><B>base.&nbsp; This meant that my family and I would not have to live
off base.&nbsp; My</B>
<BR><B>wife and I were taken out the Hario to pick out a house.&nbsp; Being
newly opened,</B>
<BR><B>we basically had the pick of the litter.&nbsp; My wife and I choose
a nice 3 bed</B>
<BR><B>room townhouse in the center of the housing complex. We moved in
within 3</B>
<BR><B>days and began to settle down.&nbsp; Nothing much happened for the
first month or</B>
<BR><B>2, then one night my daughter (3 at the time) started waking up
at night</B>
<BR><B>crying.&nbsp; She&nbsp; would point at the wall and tell me to make
the snake lady go</B>
<BR><B>away.&nbsp; This happened about once a week.&nbsp; Of course I thought
she was just</B>
<BR><B>having bad dreams.&nbsp; We would let her sleep in our bed when
this happened.&nbsp; My</B>
<BR><B>wife became pregnant at the time and we were allowed to move into
a four</B>
<BR><B>bedroom house.&nbsp; I was hoping this move would solve the snake
lady problem.</B>
<BR><B>As we moved into the new house I assured her the snake lady was
gone forever</B>
<BR><B>(boy was I wrong).&nbsp; It was about 2 week before her encounters
with the snake</B>
<BR><B>lady started again.&nbsp; This time my wife and I could actually
feel some sort of</B>
<BR><B>electrical charge throughout the house.&nbsp; These encounters intensified
and my</B>
<BR><B>daughter started to see more and more apparitions.&nbsp; She would
tell me that</B>
<BR><B>the snake lady wanted to take her away.&nbsp; I being a skeptic
thought the</B>
<BR><B>electical charge was sort of funny but never gave much though about
my</B>
<BR><B>daughters nightmares being real. Then one night My wife and I were
awaken by</B>
<BR><B>my daughter screeming at the top of her lungs.&nbsp; We rushed into
her room to</B>
<BR><B>find her pressed against the far wall, her feet approximately one
foot of the</B>
<BR><B>ground.&nbsp; my wife and I both grabbed her arms and with one of
my feet pressed</B>
<BR><B>against the wall I pulled with all my might.&nbsp; She wouldn't
budge.&nbsp; I'm not a</B>
<BR><B>small man 5' 10" 191 lbs, and I worked out all the time.&nbsp; I
could not get her</B>
<BR><B>of the wall. All the while she was screaming that the snake lady
wanted to</B>
<BR><B>take her away.&nbsp; Scared to dead I started praying in my head.&nbsp;
My daughter</B>
<BR><B>started&nbsp; to slide down the wall and she fell into our arms.&nbsp;
I don't know</B>
<BR><B>what it was but I believe there is something out there we don't
know about.</B>
<BR><B>The next day I blessed every room in the house with olive oil.&nbsp;
This seemed</B>
<BR><B>to do the trick because my daughter never had another experience.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;My wife is Japanese and she did some investigating of the
area's history.</B>
<BR><B>Hario was once an internment camp for the sick and dying japanese
solders of</B>
<BR><B>WWII.&nbsp; There if a shrine just outside the back gate for the
solders that died</B>

<P><B>&nbsp;The Shack over the Hill</B>

<P><B>By: Smokey50cal@aol.com</B>

<P><B>Years ago when my sister and I still lived at home with our parents
we had</B>
<BR><B>several strange experiences that occurred in our house that we attributed
to</B>
<BR><B>a ghost or ghosts. My parents had their own run-ins with the spirit
usually</B>
<BR><B>at different times than us and all of them were unique.</B>
<BR><B>I would like to start by naming our ghost. His name was Don Johnson.
The</B>
<BR><B>reason for this name is because when my father purchased the property
for our</B>
<BR><B>home to be built on there was an old shack over the hill that belonged
to a</B>
<BR><B>man named Don Johnson. The shack was on our property and the man
had long</B>
<BR><B>been deceased. My sister and I had known this man through our grandparents,</B>
<BR><B>which lived about a 1/8 mile from our house. Don was a kind man.
He did odd</B>
<BR><B>jobs and sold vegetables from his garden to make a living. However
he did</B>
<BR><B>tend to drink most of his money.</B>
<BR><B>Shortly after moving into the home small but strange things began
to happen.</B>
<BR><B>A shoe brush that my dad and I used before going to church disappeared
from</B>
<BR><B>under the bathroom sink. We would look the house over and could
not find it.</B>
<BR><B>Then some weeks later we would find the brush back under the sink
where it</B>
<BR><B>belonged. This happened at least once or twice a month. This was
only the</B>
<BR><B>beginning.</B>
<BR><B>My sister had a watch that my parents had given her for her birthday.
The</B>
<BR><B>watch began to do the same disappearing act but it showed up in
the oddest of</B>
<BR><B>places and times. Once it showed up while my sister was in the shower.
She</B>
<BR><B>got out to dry off and the watch was lying on her clean clothes.
That night</B>
<BR><B>we heard her scream from the basement, that's where her room was,
and we all</B>
<BR><B>hurried to see what had happened. She explained and the blame was
put on me.</B>
<BR><B>Sometime later the watch vanished again only to reappear on the
steering</B>
<BR><B>wheel of her car. She finally got to the point of giving the watch
back to my</B>
<BR><B>parents. The watch never disappeared again.</B>
<BR><B>The experiences I had were small and consisted of my bedroom door
being</B>
<BR><B>knocked on when closed and the radio going off and on. All this
happened when</B>
<BR><B>I was at home alone. I guess that since much didn't happen to me
I was the</B>
<BR><B>logical choice of being the culprit. I swear I never did any of
those things.</B>
<BR><B>Then one night our parents told us about the strange experiences
that they</B>
<BR><B>had seen. At night when all the family was in bed the commodes began
to flush</B>
<BR><B>on their own, doors being slammed, the window shades in my parents
room would</B>
<BR><B>go up and down and the feeling of cold air would lay over them at
night</B>
<BR><B>preventing them from moving. Dad said that one evening when he was
home alone</B>
<BR><B>that something walked up the steps from the basement and made its
way down</B>
<BR><B>the hall towards the bedrooms slamming the doors along the way.
He never saw</B>
<BR><B>anything but could hear the footsteps on the carpet as it walked
by him. He</B>
<BR><B>said he cursed at it and the slamming stopped and it made its way
back down</B>
<BR><B>to the basement.</B>
<BR><B>This was a lot for my sister and I to take in that night. We had
never heard</B>
<BR><B>these things and were a little shocked to know that they had be
going on for</B>
<BR><B>sometime before our parents had told us about them. Also on that
night we</B>
<BR><B>found out about another strange occurrence we all knew but had never</B>
<BR><B>mentioned to each other. That was the noticing of the digital clocks
in the</B>
<BR><B>house and in the cars reading 1:11 or 11:11. The time was correct
but we all</B>
<BR><B>read them at that certain time. We did not understand the meaning
behind that.</B>
<BR><B>We talked more that night and came to the conclusion that it must
be Don who</B>
<BR><B>had lived in the shack over the hill. He never owned the property
he lived</B>
<BR><B>on. He was allowed to live there because my grandparents let him.
They owned</B>
<BR><B>the property and that's how my father was able to purchase it. My
parents</B>
<BR><B>said that they were thinking of having someone come in, a Ghostbusters
of</B>
<BR><B>sorts, to get rid of the problem but they never did.</B>
<BR><B>Eventually my sister and I grew up and moved out of the house. The
haunting</B>
<BR><B>finally diminished after we the kids left and my father burned the
shack to</B>
<BR><B>the ground some years later. They still live there today. We tell
the stories</B>
<BR><B>to our friends, some believe and some don't but we know they are
true.</B>

<P><B>The RAF Ghost</B>

<P><B>By: alisonwilkinson@hotmail.com</B>

<P><B>It's funny really, cos I have been reading your site for quite some
time and</B>
<BR><B>have marvelled over the experiences people have had but never, ever
thought</B>
<BR><B>I would be emailing you my story.</B>
<BR><B>This experience is mainly my two friends, but I experienced it first
hand</B>
<BR><B>last night.</B>
<BR><B>They live in RAF (Royal Air Force)Quarters in Middlesex in England
and have</B>
<BR><B>never really mentioned anything before.&nbsp; A couple of weeks
ago, Susie and I</B>
<BR><B>were sitting chatting about various things when the subject of ghosts
came</B>
<BR><B>up. 'Funny enough, the hand prints have come back since Alana was
born' said</B>
<BR><B>Susie.&nbsp; 'Hand prints, what handprints?' I replied.&nbsp; It
seems that since they</B>
<BR><B>moved in over three years ago, they have had various 'things' happen.</B>
<BR><B>So she took me upstairs and there, clear as day, was a set of huge
hand</B>
<BR><B>prints on the wall just above their bed.&nbsp; Apparently, she has
tried</B>
<BR><B>everything to get rid of them and they disappeared when she was
pregnant.</B>
<BR><B>As soon as the baby was born, they came back and when I saw Susie
and Jay</B>
<BR><B>last night, they casually informed me that handprints had moved!</B>
<BR><B>By now I was getting quite spooked out.&nbsp; We went outside for
a cigerette</B>
<BR><B>with one of the music channels on the TV playing.&nbsp; When we
came back in, the</B>
<BR><B>channel had changed to some gruesome true murder documentary.&nbsp;
The hairs on</B>
<BR><B>the back of my neck were standing on end at this stage and it took
Susie a</B>
<BR><B>good 5 minutes to change the channel back!&nbsp; Also they have
both watched the</B>
<BR><B>candle that stood on top of the tele very casually move from the
middle and</B>
<BR><B>drop off at the end.&nbsp; Things have been moved around, never
hidden and the TV</B>
<BR><B>also turns itself on and off.&nbsp; Susie and Jay are very relaxed
about this and</B>
<BR><B>the ghost obviously means them no harm.</B>
<BR><B>Last night, it was Susie, Jay and me, and they told me what had
happened</B>
<BR><B>last Sunday.&nbsp; Apparently, Susie had gone up to change Alana
and had set out</B>
<BR><B>her pyjamas and nappy out on the changing mat in the bedroom.&nbsp;
She was</B>
<BR><B>bathing Alana and thought that perhaps she could use one of the
smaller</B>
<BR><B>nappies instead of the big one that she had pulled out.&nbsp; When
she went back</B>
<BR><B>into the bedroom, the pyjamas and the big nappy had been thrown
onto the</B>
<BR><B>chair and in a perfect arc were three of the smaller nappies on
the changing</B>
<BR><B>mat.&nbsp; Poor Jay got it right in the neck for that until he explained
that he</B>
<BR><B>hadn't been upstairs at all.</B>
<BR><B>Again, the hairs on my neck were standing on end and when I had
to go</B>
<BR><B>upstairs to use their toilet, Susie had to come with me!&nbsp; We
then went</B>
<BR><B>outside for a cigarette and as we were sitting there, I saw the
shadow of</B>
<BR><B>someone walk into the kitchen, didn't think anything of it until
I realised</B>
<BR><B>that we were all sitting outside.&nbsp; I told them and Susie said
that she sees</B>
<BR><B>shadows out the corner of her eye all the time.</B>
<BR><B>We then went back in and I was sitting on the sofa next to Susie
talking to</B>
<BR><B>Jay, when I noticed that she was staring at something right behind.&nbsp;
I asked</B>
<BR><B>what she was looking at, but she said nothing at first, knowing
how freaked</B>
<BR><B>out I was getting.&nbsp; I finally got it out of her and the bunny
rabbit that</B>
<BR><B>was sitting right behind me on the top of the sofa against the wall,
well</B>
<BR><B>his ears were upright against the wall as well and she saw them
bend down</B>
<BR><B>and go back up again.&nbsp; So, I think that their ghost has got
a sense of</B>
<BR><B>humour.</B>
<BR><B>Apparently, they are not the only ones to experience things, it
seems that</B>
<BR><B>quite a few people in the row of houses have had strange things
happen and</B>
<BR><B>the couple on end have even seen a shadowy figure.</B>
<BR><B>She's asked me to babysit Alana next week, must admit not too keen
on having</B>
<BR><B>the 'extra' company though!</B>

<BR><B>The Public House</B>

<P><B>By: maryalison19@hotmail.com</B>

<P><B>Hello, I was recently visiting your web site and I saw that you have
a</B>
<BR><B>listing of THe Public House Restaurant in Roswell, GA. I used to
work there</B>
<BR><B>as a hostess 2 years ago and I truly believe it to be a haunted
place. The</B>
<BR><B>story on the web site is different from what we all knew who worked
there,</B>
<BR><B>however. THis is the story that the staff knows. THe restaurant
was indeed</B>
<BR><B>there during the Civil War. It was a general store and sits right
next to</B>
<BR><B>the old Roswell Mill. The general store's daughter fell in love
with a Union</B>
<BR><B>Soldier who was later hung for treason. She and him sit upstairs
in the bar</B>
<BR><B>area in 2 chairs that overlook the square. There are two paintings.
one of a</B>
<BR><B>man and one of a woman and it is said they live behind these paintings
and</B>
<BR><B>at night they come out and waltz together near the piano.</B>
<BR><B>I have witnessed strange happenings and been told strange stories.
Upon one</B>
<BR><B>occasion, I was opening up for lunch and being the only woman on
staff that</B>
<BR><B>day, I was in charge of going into the lady's restroom and turning
on lights</B>
<BR><B>and making sure there were enough paper towels. I turned on the
lights and</B>
<BR><B>walked out adn less than 5 minutes later, I went back in and the
lights were</B>
<BR><B>off. I also was in the restroom during a dinner shift one night
and I was</B>
<BR><B>the only one in there and the toilet flushed all on its own. Needless
to say</B>
<BR><B>I hurried out of the room. One night all of the pagers we used to
tell</B>
<BR><B>people when their tables were ready kept going off even when unplugged
from</B>
<BR><B>the socket.</B>
<BR><B>Perhaps the most spine tingling tail I was told was of this young
boy. THe</B>
<BR><B>restaurant host parties and this woman came in one day to speak
to the</B>
<BR><B>events coordinator and she left her son at the top of the steps
to play.</B>
<BR><B>When the time came for her to leave the little boy said he wanted
to stay</B>
<BR><B>with the man and play. His mother questioned who he was talking
about and he</B>
<BR><B>pointed and said "The soldier." It was the Union soldier who haunts
the</B>
<BR><B>building.</B>
<BR><B>Another story is of the alarm system going off from the inside with
no doors</B>
<BR><B>or windows open and the alarm company called the manager and said
there were</B>
<BR><B>pots and pans and glass breaking.</B>
<BR><B>Another person reported the pictures randomly falling off the walls
and also</B>
<BR><B>the lamps on the tables lighting themselves.</B>
<BR><B>I just thought you might find these tales interesting. It was definitely
a</B>
<BR><B>wonderful and exciting place to work!</B>

<BR><B>The Phantom party</B>

<P><B>By: paul@66french.freeserve.co.uk</B>

<P><B>When I was in staying in London with my uncle who worked at marble
Hill house we slept in the grounds converted stable house. The appartment
doors would not stay shut but since it was so nice i didnt think much of
it. At the night time we would shut all the doors because it was so cold
and then in the morning they would be open.</B>
<BR><B>We slept in the main bedroom (me,my mum, my dad and my brother)
and thought that the doors would just bow open at night until something
really strange happened.</B>
<BR><B>One night, we had all returned to bed and were drifting off to sleep
until a sound that was like a party (according to my mum) I thought it
sounded more like gramaphone music. And then came a banging like footsteps
on a wooden floor. (there were no wooden floors anywhere in the building!)
The footsteps stopped and i heard the bedroom door open.</B>
<BR><B>I thought that mabye that my uncle had turned the television on.
But it turns out he had been sound asleep all the night since we had all
gone to bed.</B>
<BR><B>While talking the next day my mum brought up the subject and i agreed
i had heard it too. My dad finally agreed that he had heard it too and
when my uncle woke up we asked him whether he had been awake. He said he
had been asleep all night because he had drunk a bottle of whisky. He then
admitted that previous tenants had said they had encountered the ghost(s)</B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; I dont know what to believe anymore! i really dont like
sharing any</B>
<BR><B>stories i have ... i am 17 and i have a normal life..why have people
think i</B>
<BR><B>am nuts or something? who wants that with all teh pressure i have
already? i</B>
<BR><B>sometimes still feel different though. As if i am in tuen with something</B>
<BR><B>that some people may have but tenf to ignore. i have a ghost problem.
A lot</B>
<BR><B>of times i cannot see them but i know they are there...heres some
stories of</B>
<BR><B>my experiences.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; As a small child before i started school i used to
go woth my parents to</B>
<BR><B>work. they worked at an old furniture store, and it was extremely
large.</B>
<BR><B>There was always something to explore. once i was in the basement
playing</B>
<BR><B>with my dolls. i had them all spread out all over around me and
i gave them</B>
<BR><B>voices. i was saying "hello" and making the dolls talk to each other.</B>
<BR><B>"hello" i said "HELLO" came a voice. i stoped playing. i moved up
stairs as</B>
<BR><B>quickly as i could.I was playing quite close to my parents and as
i reached</B>
<BR><B>for a doll it seemed to jump away." STOP IT" i demanded. It stopped.
i</B>
<BR><B>learned talking and ordering the ghosts can sometimes help other
times it</B>
<BR><B>doesnt.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; When my family and i moved, we moved into a beautiful
house in the</B>
<BR><B>country. One of my neighbors who loved telling stories, told us
about our</B>
<BR><B>hill that our house was built on being a practice feild for shooting
in soem</B>
<BR><B>early war. A young man named ( as far as we know) Johnny was accidently</B>
<BR><B>killed when he ran in frount of a target. he is supossed to be still
here</B>
<BR><B>unable to leave. i believe we have had experiances with him in the
past. Our</B>
<BR><B>closet door which i always close would open in the night and when
i closed</B>
<BR><B>it it would again open... i was reading a book and set it on teh
counter</B>
<BR><B>while i went into our garage ...came back in two secs... it was
gone...i was</B>
<BR><B>alone in teh house..nerviously i said " johnny give it back" i heard
my cat</B>
<BR><B>meowing and i walked into the room there was the book. Coincidences???
maybe</B>
<BR><B>but i dotn know.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I woke up one night after i fell asleep on the
couch and i was awoken by</B>
<BR><B>an odd sound... there at standing a few feet away the image of a
young man</B>
<BR><B>..so clear, i thought it was a burgler! i screamed and ran in my
parents</B>
<BR><B>room. i was shaking and crying. It was the first time i told my
parents</B>

<P><B>The Old Country House!!</B>

<P><B>By: kwillis@crystald.com</B>

<P><B>When I was about 4 we moved into this house out in the country.&nbsp;
My parents told me the house was at least a 100 years old and that was
about 15 yrs ago.&nbsp; We lived in this house for about 6 or 7 yrs and
lots of spooky stuff would happen... I am not sure if there was a ghost
or what was really happening but I always felt like there was something
scary in the house... I remember whenever I would be in the bathroom I
would be taking a bath and mom would keep the door open so she could hear
if I was ok or not.. well while I would be playing around in the bath tub
I would always see what I called the "UGLY MAN" walk by... he was like
all muddy and dirty looking and he had a body and face but it was all muddy
like a character from Scooby Doo... and he was alllllways scary... and
I remember always being afraid of the closet in my room.. because I swore
up and down that, that is where he was coming from.... like he lived in
my closet.. I know this sounds like a total little kid story but I swear
its real... and also remember I would hear whispering and someone trying
to talk to me.. so whenever I would go into the kitchen or a room that
no one was in I would sing really loud or talk real loud to my dad if he
was in the living room so the whispering or whatever wouldn't be able to
talk to me..... and the weird part about all of this was a few weeks ago
I was talking to my mom about the house and she was telling me about how
we had a great Dane named "CESAR" now this dog was hella big.. well I guess
all of a sudden my mom would walk into the living room and Cesar or are
other great Dane NATASHA would be barking hysterically at the wall and
their hair on their back would be all spiked up like they were scared!!
And let me tell u id it wasn't a ghost then why would by dogs be scared
they aren't scared of anything....after we moved out nothing weird happened
in our new house so there is defiantly something or someone in that house..
I just feel sorry for the people that live there now....</B>

<P><B>The lil ole Ghost on Grosvenor Ave.....</B>

<P><B>By: ScandiSkyye@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>

<P><B>In 1997, I was in my second year of domicile on grosvenor and had
opened my</B>
<BR><B>house up to a friend that needed a place to stay. I was to be gone
all summer</B>
<BR><B>and he would have the run of the house. I worked as an archeologist
and</B>
<BR><B>frequently was gone so it wasnt uncommon for me to be gone for months
at a</B>
<BR><B>time.</B>
<BR><B>When I came back from a dig that summer, I noticed that things were
tense</B>
<BR><B>between him and I. He didnt like it when I was home- really liked
having his</B>
<BR><B>music studio in the living room. But naturally, I looked forward
to being</B>
<BR><B>home. I had not really lived with him- since he moved in right when
I was</B>
<BR><B>leaving for a project. Over the course of a month things got, well,
the way</B>
<BR><B>things do when people dont have genuine affection for one another.
This is</B>
<BR><B>when things kinda got weird.</B>
<BR><B>I would be sitting in the front living room reading, and pictures
around the</B>
<BR><B>house would be falling off the wall. Once, the spice rack flew off
the</B>
<BR><B>kitchen wall and landed five feet in front of where it should have</B>
<BR><B>landed......This was enough to fill a weaker mans pants with shit,
but I</B>
<BR><B>endured.....</B>
<BR><B>I sought a medium and she told me that a little girl that had died
there 50</B>
<BR><B>years or so before, was attracted to my energy and liked to play
games.</B>
<BR><B>However, the fact that he and I had tensions did not slip my mind.
I thought</B>
<BR><B>that I may have been projecting energy towards him- they were his
own work in</B>
<BR><B>fact!!!!</B>
<BR><B>The mediums message rang through again, in 2000, when I was excavating
a</B>
<BR><B>burial site and later visited a friend who was a para. investigator.
He had</B>
<BR><B>no idea that I had been on a burial site, and we were sicussing
UFO flaps</B>
<BR><B>that had been occurring over the Ohio valley that spring, when all
of a</B>
<BR><B>sudden he announced that had a visotor standing beside me- an attractive
lady</B>
<BR><B>and middle aged man...fuzzy mental images he said....</B>
<BR><B>I of course, dropped my chin and could do nothing except allow the
blood to</B>
<BR><B>drain slowly from the face....I asked him where they had come from,
and the</B>
<BR><B>lady answered that I had been a rather attractive source of energy
and</B>
<BR><B>someone she could relate to- plus I made a convenient exit ot of
the cemetery</B>
<BR><B>she was trapped in. Through him, the lady words spoke about being
trapped and</B>
<BR><B>uncomfortable there. He asked me if I had been anywhere near a cemetery</B>
<BR><B>lately. I&nbsp; told him about the excavation and he told me exactly
where I was</B>
<BR><B>at that site.</B>
<BR><B>He later told me that the man was pissed that I stepped on his grave....I</B>
<BR><B>knew exactly where he referring to, as I had made a mental note
about this</B>
<BR><B>transgression.</B>

<BR><B>The Lady on the Landing.</B>

<P><B>By: lilmonkey17@hotmail.com</B>

<P><B>Hi Dave, my name is Hannah and I would like to tell you about something
that happened to two of my mum's friends. This is all in England in a little
place called Boscastle in the county of Cornwall.</B>

<P><B>Coral and Roger Calcot moved to a small cottage in Boscastle over
20 years ago. They had little money and so Roger had to get a job as soon
as possible. When he finally succeeded in doing so, he went off to work
and left Coral alone in the new home. It wasn't long before she began to
have horrible feelings whenever she was upstairs in the bathroom which
was just off the landing. One day, when she was in the bathroom, she had
a very strong feeling of being watched. The door was closed but it was
as if someone was looking through the keyhole. In the end she stuffed toilet
roll in it so that she felt safer. She mentioned it to Roger one day but
he didn't believe her and she got really worried. Then, it happened. Coral
came out of the bathroom one day, and there on the landing was a little
old lady dressed all in black. Terrified, Coral ran downstairs and when
her husband got home she told him that she could not remain in the house
on her own. Roger went out and bought two dogs- Sophie and Jasmine, to
keep his wife company and to stop her being so afraid. Coral felt much
better with the dogs around but it was not long before they too became
terrified and refused to go up the stairs.Nearly every time she went upstairs,
she would see the old lady on the landing. As time went on, Coral became
ill with fear and Roger was getting worried so one day they invited some
friends round to dinner. Coral had seen the old lady on the landing so
many times but she never told them about it. One of the friends went upstairs
to the toilet and had a strong feeling of being watched. When he emerged
from the bathroom, he too saw the lady on the landing. He ran downstairs
and told Coral and Roger that he could not stay a moment longer because
of the ghost upstairs. That was when Roger realised that Coral was not
imagining things. The next day, they went out and put the house up for
sale. Shortly afterwards, two ladies came to look round the house and brought
cameras with them. They took loads of pictures but when they were developed,
none of them came out! However, they bought the cottage and on Coral and
Roger's last night in there, the lights fused, the pipes burst, the electricity
went; everything went out of order- as if the ghost didn't want them to
leave. They were so glad to get out of there!</B>

<P><B>The House on Longshore St.</B>

<P><B>By: Adoant1965@aol.com</B>

<P><B>This incident happened in 1980, when I was 15 years old. My sister
rented an</B>
<BR><B>apartment that had a finished basement. In the 1960's, a couple
lived on the</B>
<BR><B>2nd. floor of this building. One day, the husband went crazy and
strangled</B>
<BR><B>his wife, and then hung himself. At first, I really liked this apartment.
It</B>
<BR><B>was like my second home, until a couple moved into the apartment
upstairs.</B>
<BR><B>They were cool. We hung out on weekends and even though I was only
15, I</B>
<BR><B>would drink beer with them. Strange things began to happen gradually
over</B>
<BR><B>time. Small things began to disapear, windows shaking on windless
days, cold</B>
<BR><B>spots in different places. My sisters kitten vanished one day and
we never</B>
<BR><B>found it, although we could here it mewing for weeks!!!!! We were
sitting</B>
<BR><B>around partying one day,and a noise came from the kitchen. ( my
sister had</B>
<BR><B>beads in the doorway that you moved in order to get into or out
of the</B>
<BR><B>kitchen.) When we looked over, the beads seperated as if someone
was walking</B>
<BR><B>through them!!!!! Ther was nobody there!!!!! I was sitting in a
chair in the</B>
<BR><B>corner of the room, middle of summer, no air conditioning. I was
all of a</B>
<BR><B>sudden, frezing cold!!!!! My brother ( Thank god he's changed his
ways!) had</B>
<BR><B>a gun hidden in the basement. He went to get it one day and a voice
from out</B>
<BR><B>of nowhere, demanded him to " PUT THAT GUN DOWN"!!!!! Needless to
say, he</B>
<BR><B>did. He never went back into that basement again. For that matter,
not even</B>
<BR><B>into the apartment. I should have taken his advice, not to go into
the</B>
<BR><B>basement. I was drinking a bit to much one night, and I got sick.
My sister</B>
<BR><B>got upset ( rightly so.) She told me to go down the basement to
sleep it off.</B>
<BR><B>Now, I know what you are probably thinking. " This guy's drunk and
imagining</B>
<BR><B>things". NOWAY!!!!! I staggered down into that basement not really
knowing</B>
<BR><B>where I was. I passed out almost instantly. I woke up with a slap
to my face</B>
<BR><B>and a voice yelling at me to quote; " GET THE F--K OUT OF MY HOUSE,
YOU</B>
<BR><B>DRUNKEN BASTARD"!!!!! I was instantly sober!!!!! I never went back
to that</B>
<BR><B>house again, until-------- Years later, in 1996, I was driving a
taxi cab. I</B>
<BR><B>did'nt recognize the address at first, but for some reason, I felt
uneasy</B>
<BR><B>about the job. I saw the address on the house when I pulled up,
and my first</B>
<BR><B>thought was, "OH S--T"!!!!! I rang the bell ( reluctantly) and a
man came to</B>
<BR><B>the window, looking very angry. I thought, " Great, another happy
customer".</B>
<BR><B>A woman answered the door and got into my cab. She seamed to be
upbeat and</B>
<BR><B>happy. I told her I was sorry for making her wait so long for a
cab, and she</B>
<BR><B>said it was ok. I told her that the guy in the window did'nt look
very happy.</B>
<BR><B>She said, " What guy? I live alone"! I did'nt have the heart to
tell her my</B>
<BR><B>story.</B>

<BR><B>The House on Danbrook Drive</B>

<P><B>By: Christina.Muniz@tinker.af.mil</B>

<P><B>I had a few experiences in this one house I lived in when from the
time I</B>
<BR><B>was 5 until about 14.&nbsp; I lived in a city about 20 minutes from
Los Angeles.</B>
<BR><B>Anyway, one night I was sleeping and for some reason I woke up,
(I don't</B>
<BR><B>ever wake up in the middle of the night), when I woke up I saw a
white</B>
<BR><B>figure, which looked like a soldier standing in front of my bedroom
door.</B>
<BR><B>He was standing there saluting just staring at me.&nbsp; He didn't
move.&nbsp; What I</B>
<BR><B>remember the most is his eyes.&nbsp; They were bright white.&nbsp;
I was scared</B>
<BR><B>because umm yah it was a ghost and it's not normal for me to see
something</B>
<BR><B>like that but at the same time I felt safe.&nbsp; I knew that he
wasn't there to</B>
<BR><B>hurt me or he wasn't trying to scare me.&nbsp; What I wanted to
do was run to my</B>
<BR><B>moms room but instead I pulled the blanket over my head and prayed.&nbsp;
The</B>
<BR><B>next morning I told my mom about it and I remember she got this
weird look</B>
<BR><B>on her face but then was like "It must've been the lights from outside.&nbsp;
You</B>
<BR><B>probably imagined it, now stop scaring your sister."</B>
<BR><B>After that everything was fine until about a year later I had the
worst</B>
<BR><B>experience.&nbsp; My mom had rearranged my room so that my bed was
right in front</B>
<BR><B>of the door.&nbsp; One night I was sleeping and I heard what sounded
like a baby</B>
<BR><B>wearing a diaper crawl by.&nbsp; My baby brother still wore diaper's
so I thought</B>
<BR><B>it was him.&nbsp; I looked out my bedroom door and didn't see anything.&nbsp;
I</B>
<BR><B>checked on my baby brother and he was sound asleep in his crib.&nbsp;
I went back</B>
<BR><B>into bed and started to doze off when I heard it again.&nbsp; I
didn't feel like</B>
<BR><B>getting up again so I called out his name and just like that the
noise</B>
<BR><B>stopped.&nbsp; Then about 10 seconds later I felt something tug
on my blanket.</B>
<BR><B>(Now remember my bed was right in front of my door so if my brother
came in</B>
<BR><B>I would've seen him.)&nbsp; I grabbed onto my blanket but whatever
was tugging</B>
<BR><B>started pulling on it harder.&nbsp; I was so scared but I wasn't
about to let</B>
<BR><B>whatever was pulling on my blanket take it, (that's my favorite
blanket).</B>
<BR><B>So I laid on top of it.&nbsp; Then the tugging stopped.&nbsp; I
guess I passed out</B>
<BR><B>because I woke again on top of my blanket.&nbsp; Something had woke
me up I don't</B>
<BR><B>know what though.&nbsp; Anyway, I had long hair and it was hanging
off my bed</B>
<BR><B>because of the way I was laying.&nbsp; All of a&nbsp; sudden I felt
like something was</B>
<BR><B>pulling my hair very gently though, then all of a sudden it felt
like</B>
<BR><B>someone had started at the top of my head and put their fingers
through my</B>
<BR><B>hair but it didn't feel like fingers because it scratched my head,
it was</B>
<BR><B>sharp.&nbsp; I know I was not imagining it either because my head
jerked back</B>
<BR><B>since I had a lot of tangles in my hair.&nbsp; That was it.&nbsp;
I ran so fast out of</B>
<BR><B>my room.&nbsp; I ran into my parents room crying hysterically, it
took them a</B>
<BR><B>while to calm me down.&nbsp; When they finally did I told them what
happened.</B>
<BR><B>Again my mom told me it was my imagination.&nbsp; I was not imagining
it.&nbsp; Well I</B>
<BR><B>slept on their room floor for about 6 months after that.&nbsp; There
was no way I</B>
<BR><B>was going to sleep in that room.&nbsp; That was the last time anything
had</B>
<BR><B>happened like that.&nbsp; I remember I was always freezing in my
room.&nbsp; The rest</B>
<BR><B>of the house would be hot but as soon as you would go into my room
you were</B>
<BR><B>freezing.&nbsp; No matter what time of the year it was.&nbsp; One
day me, my mom, my</B>
<BR><B>brother and sister came back from my aunts.&nbsp; I was the first
to walk in my</B>
<BR><B>mom was right behind me and bro and sis were still getting out of
the car.</B>
<BR><B>It was dark in the house so I was walking to go put the light on
when out of</B>
<BR><B>nowhere this bright white ballish figure flew straight from the
kitchen into</B>
<BR><B>my room.&nbsp; My mom saw it too because I looked at her and all
she said was</B>
<BR><B>"Don't say anything!"</B>
<BR><B>We finally moved when I was about 14.&nbsp; One day my mom and I
were talking</B>
<BR><B>about that house and I had brought up that soldier I had seen That's
when</B>
<BR><B>she finally told me what happened.........</B>
<BR><B>The street we lived on had this one gang.&nbsp; There were always
drive by</B>
<BR><B>shootings, fights and cops everywhere.&nbsp; Anyway, a year before
we moved in I</B>
<BR><B>guess there had been a little shoot out between the gangsters and
the cops.</B>
<BR><B>Well a cop was shot and he crawled up to my front porch to get help
but</B>
<BR><B>before an ambulance could get there he died right there on the steps.&nbsp;
My</B>
<BR><B>bedroom window was right next to the front porch.&nbsp; So it turned
out that it</B>
<BR><B>wasn't a soldier but it was a cop dressed in his full service dress
that he</B>
<BR><B>was buried in.&nbsp; I actually feel fortunate to of had him with
us.&nbsp; I feel</B>
<BR><B>like he was protecting us.&nbsp; A lot of the kids on my street
that I grew up</B>
<BR><B>with has been beat up bad, shot, joined a gang, got pregnant really
young,</B>
<BR><B>etc.&nbsp; Everyone except for me and my siblings, (there's 6 of
us).&nbsp; It was a</B>
<BR><B>dangerous neighborhood but I always had this feeling when I was
in that</B>
<BR><B>house like I was safe and I had nothing to worry about.&nbsp; But
at the same</B>
<BR><B>time I always felt like something or someone was watching me.&nbsp;
Well that's</B>

<BR><B>When the last renters moved out of the Chestnut house they told
the realtor, that handles the rent and such,&nbsp; that the house was haunted.&nbsp;
They both (two 24- 25 year old men) said they could hear footsteps on the
vinyl tile floors upstairs when no one was up there.</B>
<BR><B>When the realtor told my friend that he also added that the renter
before last also reported strange things.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;He said the little girl (12 years old ) told him that "Fred"
used to come and set on her bed and talk with her.&nbsp; She said he was

be afriad of a spirit</B>
<BR><B>but what i enconterd was no ghost it was evil on the day of july
2nd 1999</B>
<BR><B>i turned 15 that day i lived in a normal 2 storie house but on the
3rd floor you can see a old abandon insane asylum it was&nbsp; ontop of
a rather large hill suronded by wood's (its in new york) sometimes when
my freind slept over we would stare out my bedroom window we would look
at it the reason for this is because evrey morning at 3:14 the lights in
the asylum would go on at the same time evrey morning for 2 minutes it
was a very creepy building and it would scare the $*** out of me and one
day my freind "jim" on our way to school said that we should go up there
sometime i said 2 words "Hell No" then he said he would give me $200 dollers
to stay 1 hour up there so strangley enough i said ok so that weekend we
went up there&nbsp; it was saturday at 2:30 in the morning i enterd the
asylum it was very very dark i turned on the flashlight and looked around
and found nothing at all so i walked around for a while not finding anything
at all until 3:13 i entered what seemed like the west wing and in front
of me was a large hallway and i started hearing footsteps and it was freaking
me out</B>
<BR><B>but something told me to looked at my watch it was 3:14and the lights
went on and at the end of the hallway there was a human figure standing
at the end of the hallway i said hello and it started walking towerds me
and i was so scared i couldnt move when it got to me he said hi in a non
trentening voice he knew i was scared so he said "you have no reason to
fear me im harmless but what will be here in a minute is" i asked him what
he meant by that he said that he was here to warn me that there is a evil
force here he said that he was consernd about me i asked if he was the
guy that turned on the lights evrey morning he said no he then said to
leave before it gets here the figure then faded&nbsp; i wasnt scared after
that but about 10 seconds later i did then a large figure in a blue cloak
apered i was then freaked out because thats what the other spirit was talking
about i notecd that the man in the cloak was wairing a pentagram the man
then said "your in my power now" all i could think was "OH S***"</B>
<BR><B>the man then raised what looked like a dagger and nerley stabed
me in the head then strangely enough i was pulled away by something then
i heard anthor&nbsp; voice say "stay the hell away from him you have no
reason to take his life away" i knew that it was the spirit from before
and after that all i could remember was being back at the entrence of the
building</B>

left the forest we crashed at my house for the night then the next afternoon

the box was from the asylum i opend it up and inside there was a cross
and broken pieces of a pentegramfor some and then there was a card that

<BR><B>The Ghosts in my House</B>

<P><B>By: Ambbland22@aol.com</B>
<BR>&nbsp;

<P><B>There are at least 2 ghosts that I know of that come to my home.&nbsp;
There is a</B>
<BR><B>little girl that I have never seen, and there is an old man that
I have in</B>
<BR><B>fact seen.&nbsp; I live in a twinplex and my land lord lives in
the 1 next to</B>
<BR><B>mine.&nbsp; The old man was his grandfather that died in his twinplex.&nbsp;
The little</B>
<BR><B>girl has been seen by his entire family leaving from 1 of the kids'
closets</B>
<BR><B>and walking down the stairs and disappearing into the closet at
the bottom of</B>
<BR><B>the stair case.&nbsp; The old man whom I call (Gramps) has sort
of taken the</B>
<BR><B>little girl under his wings and if you see him she's not to far
away from</B>
<BR><B>him.&nbsp; I think they like to be in my son's room because he hasn't
slept in his</B>
<BR><B>room for a month now, and when he does he wakes up in the middle
of the night</B>
<BR><B>a screams bloody murder until we come in and get him.&nbsp; I don't
mind the fact</B>
<BR><B>that there are ghosts that frequent my home I just don't like the
fact that</B>
<BR><B>they scare my son who is 2 years old.&nbsp; They made their presence
known to my</B>
<BR><B>son Zachary before they did to us because long before he wouldn't
sleep in</B>
<BR><B>his room he didn't like to be anywhere in the house by himself.&nbsp;
When he'd be</B>
<BR><B>in the bathtub he'd cry and stare at the corner of my bathroom wall.&nbsp;
I have</B>
<BR><B>had my coffee cups rearranged in my cupboard, and when we had my</B>
<BR><B>brother-in-law and his wife over we were sitting down talking while
the kids</B>
<BR><B>were playing and the radio came on full blast.&nbsp; There was an
Elvis gospel CD</B>
<BR><B>in the CD player when the radio came on.&nbsp; My landlords wife
has got a picture</B>
<BR><B>she took of the little girl or Gramps.&nbsp; We don't know who it
is it's just a</B>
<BR><B>big ball of white light.&nbsp; There is quite possibly more that
just haven't made</B>
<BR><B>their presence known yet.</B>

<P><B>Hello. My name is Nichole and I'm 14. And I'm e-mailing you from
my</B>
<BR><B>friend Eric's screen name. well anyway, The freakiest stuff has
been</B>
<BR><B>happening in my bed room. See&nbsp; the first thing that happened
was when I</B>
<BR><B>came home from school and noticed my figures on my dresser had been</B>
<BR><B>moved. The next was when I woke up and found I had been tucked in
so</B>
<BR><B>tght I got to call my mother in to help me get out of bed. That's
when I</B>
<BR><B>started sleeping on the couch! I mean I packed up my stuff and went</B>
<BR><B>downstairs for good! well, soon my mom said enough was enough and
I had</B>
<BR><B>to go get my room back... right. I've always belived in ghosts and
I</B>
<BR><B>very much doubt something with that much power is going to listen
to me.</B>
<BR><B>BUT I tried anyway. I sat on my bed and siad very nicely ,"look,
I don't</B>
<BR><B>know if you want anything but I don't have anywhere else to go so,</B>
<BR><B>please try to calm down with the spooky stuff." my father thought
I was</B>
<BR><B>crazy and I bet the ghost did too but it made me feel better. I
still</B>
<BR><B>get scared sometimes when I'll leave my messy bed to go wash my
face in</B>
<BR><B>the bathroom and come back to find a made bed, but A ghost that
makes my</B>
<BR><B>bed for me can't be all that bad.</B>

<P><B>The Ghost in my House</B>

<P><B>By: Stephanie445@cs.com</B>

<P><B>My big brother told me this.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; One night three of my big brothers fine friends was spending
a night. They</B>
<BR><B>were in the den wearing white under shirts watching MTV. One of
his friends</B>
<BR><B>fell asleep so they just left him in there. When that friend woke
up he saw a</B>
<BR><B>white figure running around in front of him. Then that figure sat
down next</B>
<BR><B>to him. He thought it was my big brother Daniel. So he said to the
figure</B>
<BR><B>while he nudged him to cut it out and stop playing around, but the
thing is</B>
<BR><B>when he went to nudge him his shoulder went threw the figure. After
that</B>
<BR><B>happened my big brothers friend went screaming and running to Daniel's
room</B>
<BR><B>banging on the door to let him in. I remember hearing him screaming.
My Mom</B>
<BR><B>has also seen the ghost too. She says its a good one cause it just
mind it</B>
<BR><B>own business. It helps us sometimes too. If we drop something and
we can't</B>

<BR><B>The Dark Shadow</B>

<P><B>By: Bearbruno6@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>I know that not all dark apparitions are necessarily mean or evil
spirits. I</B>
<BR><B>mean, come on lets face it, goodguys don't always wear white, but
this time</B>
<BR><B>the difference was as plain as night and day. Three years ago my
wife's</B>
<BR><B>mother passed away, and, a few weeks after, my wife and I were sitting
in the</B>
<BR><B>living room watching television when I turned to speak to her I
saw something</B>
<BR><B>I will never forget til the day I'm worm food. I saw a figure, human
shaped</B>
<BR><B>but with no decernable features. A dark shadow, if you will. It
was standing</B>
<BR><B>behind my wife, reaching for her neck with, for lack of a better
description,</B>
<BR><B>hands. Except these hands had no fingers, they almost like pincers.
For a</B>
<BR><B>split second, I was speechless. Then It hit me, this "thing" was
going to</B>
<BR><B>touch her. Forgive my language, but, I stated quite loudly, "What
the f*#*"!</B>
<BR><B>At which time the shadow turned and looked at me, and seemed to
shout or act</B>
<BR><B>as if it were caught by suprise, but, where it's eye's and mouth
should be,</B>
<BR><B>there were only three round holes through which I could see the
window behind</B>
<BR><B>it. Though I could see through the three holes, I could not see
through the</B>
<BR><B>shadow its self. Well needless to say my wife was startled at my
outburst,</B>
<BR><B>and it seemed I startled the shadow as well, because it disappered.
Though it</B>
<BR><B>was gone, it left me with a strange uneasy feeling. My wife, not
a believer</B>
<BR><B>in the unknown, to this day thinks I'm seeing things. She says it's
my</B>
<BR><B>seizure meds. I doubt it, because nothing has ever left me with
such feeling.</B>
<BR><B>I told my mother of this, and this is a woman whose faith can move
mountains,</B>
<BR><B>she also has a very open mind and told me to pray. This brings me
to Shi</B>
<BR><B>(pronounced 'she'). Shi is what I like to call my guardian. Whether
an angel</B>
<BR><B>or not, all I know is that this is an entity that has come into
my life and</B>
<BR><B>has never hurt me or my family. And if to say that I'm crazy because
I hear</B>
<BR><B>her when she speaks to me, well then so be it. I know that every
time</B>
<BR><B>something is troubling in my life, Shi shows up. Its hard to explain,
but</B>
<BR><B>there is a positive force there, and, well, lets just say the prayers,
and</B>
<BR><B>Shi, gave whatever the shadow was, the heave-ho.</B>

<P><B>The Cox Kids</B>

<P><B>By: ceadcounc@mcleodusa.net</B>

<P><B>I'm 16 years old &amp; am from a small town in Central Illinois.
I have</B>
<BR><B>lived out on my farm all of my life.&nbsp; 25 years a go a family
by the name</B>
<BR><B>of Cox lived in a farm house next to mine. The story is well known</B>
<BR><B>around my town &amp; my house is known for being haunted &amp; has
num,erous</B>
<BR><B>unexplained mysteries.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;My story begins 25 years ago. In a family of 11 kids &amp;
a stay home mom,</B>
<BR><B>the oldest daughter (18 yrs old) had practically no life due to
the</B>
<BR><B>constant babysitting &amp; house sitting. Her boyfriend barely got
to spend</B>
<BR><B>time with her &amp; it began to get unbearable. One day, after they
had</B>
<BR><B>previously made plans to get together, she found out she had to
babysit</B>
<BR><B>the children. She was upset &amp; complained to the boyfriend about
always</B>
<BR><B>having to watch the kids. This wasn't a rare event. He was used
to being</B>
<BR><B>pushed off &amp; their plans getting rearranged. Hearing how often
she had</B>
<BR><B>to moniter these kids, he was getting sick of it &amp; I guess,
thought she</B>
<BR><B>was, too.&nbsp; Somehow he got the hint that it would make her happier
if her</B>
<BR><B>burden with the children was relieved. However, the decision he
made</B>
<BR><B>turned out to do devastatingly more harm than good. That night he
showed</B>
<BR><B>up unexpected. He claimed he found a rare bird in a tree near by
&amp;</B>
<BR><B>wanted to show the kids &amp; try to shoot the bird down. He told
the</B>
<BR><B>girlfriend to take a break &amp; wait inside for a while, while
he took care</B>
<BR><B>of the kids.&nbsp; She agreed. One by one the children went out
into the</B>
<BR><B>woods with him &amp; he put his rifle up to them &amp; fired. 5
of the 11</B>
<BR><B>children were killed that night. All of them thinking the gunshots
they</B>
<BR><B>heard were fired at the bird instead of their siblings. The bodies
were</B>
<BR><B>later found &amp; the man still remains in prison. He was 17 when
he</B>
<BR><B>commited this crime.</B>

<P><B>&nbsp; My house, being next door to the tragic farm house, has had
it's share</B>
<BR><B>of scary stories. Numerous times I have had professional poltergeist</B>
<BR><B>photographers come to my house to take pictures of the "children".
Also,</B>
<BR><B>two pictures have showed up at my house with completely unexplainable</B>
<BR><B>images. One has a simple outline of a body above the top of my stairs.</B>
<BR><B>We have no clue who took this picture &amp; are sure it wasn't a
glare or</B>
<BR><B>anything because it was nighttime &amp; you can easily see what
looks like a</B>
<BR><B>faded body.&nbsp; The other picture is one of a little girl, who
no one in my</B>
<BR><B>family has ever seen before. She is close to the camera &amp; has
a</B>
<BR><B>surprised look on her face. The scary part is she has her mouth
open &amp;</B>
<BR><B>you can clearly see sharp teeth. Not like the huge fake vampire
teeth</B>
<BR><B>for Halloween, these are sharp but small teeth. Also, her face is
the</B>
<BR><B>only thing that developed properly in the entire photo. My home
has</B>
<BR><B>always had little scary things happen to it. For instance, one night
i</B>
<BR><B>was home alone &amp; went upstairs to my room. I heard the doorbell
ring. It</B>
<BR><B>hadn't been working for nearly 5 years! I went downstairs, kinda</B>
<BR><B>surprised that it worked, &amp; when I did I found all of the lights
off in</B>
<BR><B>the house. At night when i'm home alone I always turn on all of
the</B>
<BR><B>lights so I'm less scared. I ran upstairs &amp; the light was on
so i new</B>
<BR><B>the power wasn't off. When i went back downstairs all of the lights
were</B>
<BR><B>on &amp; all of my windows were open, the kitchen table was completely
moved</B>
<BR><B>10 feet from where it should've been &amp; the freezer &amp; fridge
doors were</B>
<BR><B>wide open!!!. I freaked out. I ran to my next door neighbors house
&amp;</B>
<BR><B>stayed ther until my family got home. Another time, I was home alone
&amp;</B>
<BR><B>was on the phone with my dad. It was fall so most of the windows
in my</B>
<BR><B>house were open. I was in the living room where there are 3 windows.
It</B>
<BR><B>was pitch black out &amp; while on the phone I heard noises outside.
There</B>
<BR><B>is gravel &amp; stones lining the sides of my house &amp; I heard
something</B>
<BR><B>moving. Right then the T.V. shuit off. I stupidly walked towards
the</B>
<BR><B>window. Right then something jumped at the screen &amp; started
growling &amp;</B>
<BR><B>scratching at the walls of my house. This window is high above the</B>
<BR><B>ground so the posibility that it was a dog or something is impossible.</B>
<BR><B>Plus the sounds it made were so human like that there was no way
at all</B>
<BR><B>it was an animal. The screen started to rip &amp; i never saw what
it was</B>
<BR><B>outside of the window. It started screaming when i started screaming.
I</B>
<BR><B>ran into the other room &amp; it followed me to the window in my
kitchen. It</B>
<BR><B>was trying to get in the kitchen window. I was a mess. My dad was
still</B>
<BR><B>on the phone &amp; he was freaking out, too. About 10 sedconds later
it all</B>
<BR><B>stopped &amp; it was as though nothing had happened. Well, I have
plenty</B>
<BR><B>more stories about my house but i am running out of room to write
it.</B>
<BR><B>Thanx for listening.</B>

<BR><B>from my bed I could see hers and in it I saw a dark shadow lying
in the shape</B>

back she</B>
<BR><B>got into her bed and then sat up looking really pale and I asked
her what was</B>
<BR><B>wrong and she said she felt something tug on her bed sheets so in

<P><B>The Antique Mirror</B>

<P><B>By: sy_kik_chik@yahoo.com</B>

<P><B>Before our marriage, my husband purchased a home built sometime previous
to</B>
<BR><B>1870 in the center of a small old town in Michigan.&nbsp; It is
a lovely house</B>
<BR><B>(we still have it) with high ceilings and wide archways between
some of the</B>
<BR><B>rooms.&nbsp; When we moved in we had very modern furniture, which
really didn't</B>
<BR><B>look right in the house, so our friends would bring us antiques
whenever</B>
<BR><B>they could find them very cheaply (or free).&nbsp; One friend brought
us a very</B>
<BR><B>large, round antique mirror that he had found in a house his company
was</B>
<BR><B>hired to tear down.&nbsp; It was the kind with a gilded wood and
molded frame</B>
<BR><B>with a medallion at the top.&nbsp; The glass, while it had some
dark spots and</B>
<BR><B>shadings, was in exceptionally good condition.&nbsp; This was back
in the mid- to</B>
<BR><B>late-70s and we had parties almost every weekend.&nbsp; In the summer
when the</B>
<BR><B>doors were left open, no one bothered knocking, they just opened
the screen</B>
<BR><B>and came in.&nbsp; Late one Friday or Saturday evening shortly after
receiving</B>
<BR><B>the mirror I was sitting on a low sofa against the east wall of
the living</B>
<BR><B>room.&nbsp; Also on this wall was a large archway leading into the
dining room,</B>
<BR><B>which is where the main entry door that we used was located (there
was also</B>
<BR><B>a door leading into the living room from the front porch, but no
one used</B>
<BR><B>this one).&nbsp; The mirror was hung on the north wall, right next
to the couch</B>
<BR><B>where I was sitting.&nbsp; Everyone else was sitting in the middle
or at the</B>
<BR><B>opposite end of the room (large room).&nbsp; I was looking to my
right and</B>
<BR><B>noticed in the mirror that a young man was walking through the archway
into</B>
<BR><B>the living room and stopped right at the threshold.&nbsp; At first
glance I did</B>
<BR><B>not recognize him, so I turned on the couch to look at him directly
. . .</B>
<BR><B>and there was no one there!&nbsp; I looked over at the mirror again
-- and there</B>
<BR><B>he was.&nbsp; He was not a big guy, about 5'8" or 5'9", thin build,
dark hair</B>
<BR><B>(short for the times) and wearing what looked like one of those
blue-gray</B>
<BR><B>workshirts.&nbsp; I looked toward the archway again -- no one was
there.&nbsp; I shot</B>
<BR><B>off the couch and into the dining room, to see if anyone was playing
a trick</B>
<BR><B>on me -- there was no one in any part of the house other than the
living</B>
<BR><B>room.&nbsp; It made me very uneasy and I could never sit in that
area again.&nbsp; In</B>
<BR><B>fact, I moved that couch a week later, and even though the mirror
still</B>
<BR><B>hangs there all these years later, I try to avoid looking in it.&nbsp;
A couple</B>
<BR><B>of years after this happened I joined the local historical society.&nbsp;
I met a</B>
<BR><B>wonderful tiny old lady in her 90s.&nbsp; She told me that she had
been in my</B>
<BR><B>home many times in her youth and I found out from her that during</B>
<BR><B>prohibition, the people who owned the house would have parties with
bootleg</B>
<BR><B>liquor.&nbsp; There was an argument late one evening and a young
man was killed</B>
<BR><B>by a blast from both barrels of a shotgun at close range in the
area of the</B>
<BR><B>front entrance to the dining room.&nbsp; I'm not sure if it was
him or not, but</B>
<BR><B>for three or four years after that, every night at 3:10 am, I would
hear</B>
<BR><B>slow, but steady footsteps (on the creaky wood floors) walk from

<BR><B>Strange Happenings in the Family Home</B>

<P><B>By: leshock22@yahoo.com</B>

<P><B>I first became aware of a presence in our home when I</B>
<BR><B>was a child of four years old. When I was four, my</B>
<BR><B>brother was born and my parents moved him into the</B>
<BR><B>bedroom next to theirs. I was moved into my very own</B>
<BR><B>room, upstairs. My older sister occupied the room next</B>
<BR><B>to mine. It did not take me long to realize that there</B>
<BR><B>was something odd about this new room I was in--I</B>
<BR><B>would wake in the night, chilled, with the</B>
<BR><B>overwhelming feeling that someone was watching me.</B>
<BR><B>Sometimes I caught fleeting glimpses of what looked</B>
<BR><B>like a shadow on one particular wall. When I mentioned</B>
<BR><B>the shadow to Mom, she attributed it to light-play</B>
<BR><B>from the moon, and other rational explainations. I</B>
<BR><B>tried very hard to believe her explainations, and to</B>
<BR><B>make the shadow sightings "go away," but I simply</B>
<BR><B>couldn't shake the vision of a man in an overcoat,</B>
<BR><B>wearing a fedora. I could never actually see this man,</B>
<BR><B>just an outline-a shadow, but I knew "he" was there. I</B>
<BR><B>can't say I felt threatened by this figure; I just</B>
<BR><B>felt watched and not alone.</B>
<BR><B>I suppose I should describe our family home. It is a</B>
<BR><B>large, cape-cod style home built in the 1940's just</B>
<BR><B>after the war. The family that built the home were</B>
<BR><B>obviously influenced by WWII (as was the world, I</B>
<BR><B>would think!) and they built a "secret room" which I</B>
<BR><B>imagine was designed to hide the family if war ever</B>
<BR><B>broke out on home soil. This room was only accessable</B>
<BR><B>via a trap door in the kitchen floor, and it led to</B>
<BR><B>the secret room in the basement. (my dad sealed this</B>
<BR><B>room off before I was born, although I know exactly</B>
<BR><B>where the trapdoor is) There is also a "secret</B>
<BR><B>passageway" that leads between the closets of the two</B>
<BR><B>upstairs rooms. This passageway had been sealed before</B>
<BR><B>my parents bought the home. This house was the second</B>
<BR><B>built on the foundation, the first was a farmhouse</B>
<BR><B>dating back to the late 1800's, which burnt when my</B>
<BR><B>mother was a child in the 1930's. The family that</B>
<BR><B>originally built the cape-cod didn't live there long,</B>
<BR><B>and it became a rest home for the affluent elderly in</B>
<BR><B>the community for several years. My parents bought the</B>
<BR><B>home in 1954, and I was born eleven years later.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;There were other strange occurances in the house in my</B>
<BR><B>younger years, such as doors opening and closing by</B>
<BR><B>themselves, and doors locking when there were no</B>
<BR><B>locks, and the piano playing by itself-- but I will</B>
<BR><B>fastforward to 1974, when my older sister got married.</B>
<BR><B>I took the opportunity to move into her larger room,</B>
<BR><B>and that is when the strangeness went into overdrive.</B>
<BR><B>I hadn't actually even moved completely into the room</B>
<BR><B>when the weirdness began. I had moved my record player</B>
<BR><B>into the room, along with a student desk. I was</B>
<BR><B>showing the room to a friend one afternoon when the</B>
<BR><B>door slammed behind us. When we turned to look at the</B>
<BR><B>door, the shade on the opposite window flew off the</B>
<BR><B>hinges and landed at our feet in the middle of the</B>
<BR><B>room. We both screamed and ran to the door, only to</B>
<BR><B>find it locked (and there wasn't a lock on the door).</B>
<BR><B>We managed to finally get it open and run down the</B>
<BR><B>stairs. My friend would never even go into the room</B>
<BR><B>again, let alone spend the night with me. I didn't let</B>
<BR><B>it bother me however, and moved the bed into the room</B>
<BR><B>and took up residence. The room always stayed</B>
<BR><B>incredibly cold, even in the heat of an Ohio summer.</B>
<BR><B>My dad installed triple the insulation into that room</B>
<BR><B>to try to help with the chill, but it remained</B>
<BR><B>downright cold. There were countless nights when I</B>
<BR><B>would awaken to knocking on the walls. Sometimes I</B>
<BR><B>would knock back, and "it" would knock back to me.</B>
<BR><B>When I told my parents about the knocking, my dad said</B>
<BR><B>it was a tree limb scraping the house. The knocking</B>
<BR><B>became so intense that he ended up cutting the tree</B>
<BR><B>down, but the knocking continued. My parents installed</B>
<BR><B>an intercom system into my room next to my bed, so I</B>
<BR><B>could page them when the knocking started. Dad seemed</B>
<BR><B>convinced that it was neighborhood boys throwing rocks</B>
<BR><B>at my window. It didn't sound like that though, and</B>
<BR><B>the knocking was coming from an inside wall, not an</B>
<BR><B>outside one.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;One afternoon I was lying on the bed reading, and I</B>
<BR><B>got the overwhelming feeling that I was being watched.</B>
<BR><B>I sat up on the bed and said outloud "Stop it! There's</B>
<BR><B>no such thing as ghosts!" and no sooner had I uttered</B>
<BR><B>the words, a figurine on a shelf began to wobble and</B>
<BR><B>then flew off the shelf and across to the bed, hitting</B>
<BR><B>me on the forehead. I slept on the sofa for a month</B>
<BR><B>after that!</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;My family was even beginning to notice strange</B>
<BR><B>happenings by this time. The television would turn</B>
<BR><B>itself on and off, or alternately increase to top</B>
<BR><B>volume without anyone being in the room. Dad said we</B>
<BR><B>had a bum set and bought a new one, but it did the</B>
<BR><B>same. We had the wiring replaced but it still</B>
<BR><B>happened. My mom declared that if it was a ghost, it</B>
<BR><B>certainly wasn't going to run her out of the home she</B>
<BR><B>loved. (this is true, she still lives there with the</B>
<BR><B>ghost) Other things that would happen in the house</B>
<BR><B>included radios switching on and off, lights</B>
<BR><B>flickering, the washing machine switching on and</B>
<BR><B>running a cycle, and of course the shadow wandering</B>
<BR><B>around upstairs. It was all beginning to frighten me</B>
<BR><B>quite a bit, especially the knocking noises. If the</B>
<BR><B>knocking started, I would buzz Mom on the intercom and</B>
<BR><B>she would race upstairs, but as soon as she reached</B>
<BR><B>the top step the knocking would stop. I began to think</B>
<BR><B>perhaps I was going a bit crazy.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;I went away to college and something strange happened</B>
<BR><B>in my old bedroom about a week after I had left. I</B>
<BR><B>still had some clothing hanging in the closet, and</B>
<BR><B>there were a few posters still hanging on the wall,</B>
<BR><B>but otherwise it was empty. My mom heard a funny noise</B>
<BR><B>upstairs one afternoon and went up to investigate. She</B>
<BR><B>checked the first bedroom and saw nothing amiss, and</B>
<BR><B>went on down the hall to my room. She opened the door</B>
<BR><B>and discovered that the mirrored tile on one wall had</B>
<BR><B>exploded all over the place. There were shards of</B>
<BR><B>glass sticking in the opposite wall, and had scraped</B>
<BR><B>across the ceiling like claw-marks. My posters hung in</B>
<BR><B>shreads. She noticed my closet door hanging open, and</B>
<BR><B>shards of glass sticking in the clothes still hanging</B>
<BR><B>inside. She shut the door and waited for dad to get</B>
<BR><B>home from work. He decided that it must have been a</B>
<BR><B>freak lightning hit (although the day was sunny and</B>
<BR><B>cloudless) and rang the insurers to come out and</B>
<BR><B>investigate. The investigator noted that the point of</B>
<BR><B>impact seemed to be the upper corner of the wall where</B>
<BR><B>the mirrored tile met the ajoining wall. Oddly, he</B>
<BR><B>also noted that the broken wood in that corner was</B>
<BR><B>pointing outward, as if the lightning had been inside</B>
<BR><B>the room and went out, instead of the lightning</B>
<BR><B>hitting outside and coming in. The insurance company</B>
<BR><B>still paid for the damages, although they could never</B>
<BR><B>find the point on the outside of the house where the</B>
<BR><B>lightning had come in. When I heard about it I came</B>
<BR><B>home to view it, and noticed that the wall in question</B>
<BR><B>was the one where I always heard the knocking.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;As I said, my mom still lives in the house, and</B>
<BR><B>strange things still persist. She keeps the washing</B>
<BR><B>machine unplugged but unless the water is cut off it</B>
<BR><B>still fills up. (this is the third "faulty" washer</B>
<BR><B>we've had) The TV still plays tricks too. My dad</B>
<BR><B>passed away in the house two years ago, and on the</B>
<BR><B>night after he died I was staying with mom (although I</B>
<BR><B>wasn't about to sleep upstairs ever again) and in the</B>
<BR><B>middle of the night we both heard faint music playing</B>
<BR><B>upstairs--bluegrass music, to be precise, which was</B>
<BR><B>Dads favorite--and we reckoned that there must be a</B>
<BR><B>party going on to welcome Dad to the other side. Mom</B>
<BR><B>has since sealed off the upstairs and only lives in</B>
<BR><B>the downstairs part of the house.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;My brother had plenty of strange things happen to him</B>
<BR><B>in the house as well, as did my sister, and as a</B>
<BR><B>result none of us want Mom to bequeath the house to</B>
<BR><B>us. She can't understand why!</B>

<P><B>Strange Happenings in My Home</B>

<P><B>By: goku777goten@yahoo.com</B>

<P><B>(Alright...these aren't the longest stories you'll</B>
<BR><B>ever see but that happened to me in my home.)</B>
<BR><B>Every single night in my house when I was 5 years old</B>
<BR><B>my parents would come in, and put me in bed, mostly my</B>
<BR><B>mother because my father wasn't home much. I never</B>
<BR><B>liked to sleep in the darked and there were no outlets</B>
<BR><B>in my room for a lamp, or non that wanted to work at</B>
<BR><B>the time. As I lay in bed almost every night I'd look</B>
<BR><B>out into the hall and I would be able to see the hall</B>
<BR><B>light on.</B>
<BR><B>Almost every single night as I lay in bed a boy would</B>
<BR><B>walk past my door several times then stop. It was a</B>
<BR><B>white glowing type thing that I remember perfectly</B>
<BR><B>well. It scared me a bit, but I never got an evil aura</B>
<BR><B>off of him.</B>
<BR><B>A thing about the boy is that he had died a long time</B>
<BR><B>ago before we had moved in. It scared me all the time</B>
<BR><B>to re-call it though, even though he isn't bad. I've</B>
<BR><B>only slept with the door open once since then, my</B>
<BR><B>parents got the outlets working. I was sleeping in a</B>
<BR><B>different room, but it was across from the room the</B>
<BR><B>boy had died in. I looked outwards from my slumber, my</B>
<BR><B>glasses still on my face because I always fell asleep</B>
<BR><B>watching TV. I saw the boy, and he went into my</B>
<BR><B>brothers room. That night my brother got really</B>
<BR><B>sick...I don't know what happened but the boy had died</B>
<BR><B>of a sickness.</B>
<BR><B>(Another thing that happened)</B>
<BR><B>Me and my friends were sitting out on my back porch</B>
<BR><B>and my one friend had brought a oujia(Spelling)board</B>
<BR><B>with her. My other friend suggested that we play, of</B>
<BR><B>course I didn't want to because I have had past</B>
<BR><B>experiences that turned out bad with those things with</B>
<BR><B>other friends. We sat at the table and put each of our</B>
<BR><B>hands on it. Before we started though we read</B>
<BR><B>something that had said you must finish a question, we</B>
<BR><B>thought we would. Beside the porch is a pool (this</B>
<BR><B>will fit into what happened as I go.) We didn't</B>
<BR><B>believe that the board would actually work though..and</B>
<BR><B>so we tried, even with the paste experiences I didn't</B>
<BR><B>think it would. We had done this though:&nbsp; We tapped</B>
<BR><B>our fingers while the thing was moving, so that no one</B>
<BR><B>could move it themselves. We did get in contact with a</B>
<BR><B>spirit, and we, of course, ended up not finishing a</B>
<BR><B>question. The filter for the pool that had pushed out</B>
<BR><B>water began to turn towards us and the water started</B>
<BR><B>to spray pout at us. We could see the ripples coming.</B>
<BR><B>We asked if we could finish the question, each time</B>
<BR><B>getting a rude remark then a no. Finally he/she did</B>
<BR><B>let us though when we had said sorry for it and the</B>
<BR><B>water returned to normal.</B>
<BR><B>(Yet another)</B>
<BR><B>About a year ago I met up with some different kind of</B>
<BR><B>people, Wiccans to mostly say and I still am Wiccan</B>
<BR><B>now. I took it in, because God actually hadn't helped</B>
<BR><B>me one slight bit with my life so I started to believe</B>
<BR><B>in godS. I learned some good spells, and some bad, the</B>
<BR><B>ones I used most were the exorcism(spelling) spells</B>
<BR><B>for haunted houses around here. My house I knew had</B>
<BR><B>quite a lot of ghosts in it and I decided to get rid</B>
<BR><B>of one particular one, one that would scare the entire</B>
<BR><B>family as we slept. At night, if you were to turn off</B>
<BR><B>the light in the living room, the room would turn a</B>
<BR><B>deep, dark blood red and the windows to the place</B>
<BR><B>would disapear. When you&nbsp; looked to one corner of the</B>
<BR><B>place, you could see a black figure walking out of it.</B>
<BR><B>This is the ghost I decided to rid the house of. It</B>
<BR><B>never spoke during anything, it only appear and</B>
<BR><B>nothing more. My sister and her friends hadn't</B>
<BR><B>believed me when I told them of what was going on in</B>
<BR><B>the room and they tested it for themselves. As we did</B>
<BR><B>it, they saw exactly what I was saying and screamed</B>
<BR><B>for me to turn the light on. I actually sleep in that</B>
<BR><B>room still, the ghost is still there but it doesn't</B>
<BR><B>bother us anymore. When I had tried the</B>
<BR><B>exorcism(spelling) on it, the ghost had gotten angry</B>
<BR><B>and thrown the lamp at me..if not for me dodging it</B>
<BR><B>and then grabbing it before it hit the wall Iw ould</B>
<BR><B>have been in trouble. It glared at me and disapeared</B>
<BR><B>and I apologized because I thought it was a bad ghost.</B>
<BR><B>When I returned to the room that night and from then</B>
<BR><B>on, the ghost never came back, or didn't bother us</B>
<BR><B>anyway. There are other ghosts in my house, ones that</B>
<BR><B>are in the coal cellor, but I've only heard them.</B>
<BR><B>(Stuff that happened out of my house.)</B>
<BR><B>One night I was out with my friends, against my</B>
<BR><B>parents will we had left when they were asleep. It was</B>
<BR><B>around 3 in the morning and we wanted to see what was</B>
<BR><B>around the area. We went up to the graveyard near us</B>
<BR><B>and sat down by some of the older graves, deeper into</B>
<BR><B>the graveyard. As we were sitting there I looked up to</B>
<BR><B>see a darkened black figure standing by one of the</B>
<BR><B>trees, he wasn't looking at me or my friends but</B>
<BR><B>something else. I had been leaning up against a grave,</B>
<BR><B>I didn't have much respect for the dead at that time</B>
<BR><B>until after this. I turned around and looked up at the</B>
<BR><B>though to see a white figure standing there, looking</B>
<BR><B>at the black figure. They then turned their eyes</B>
<BR><B>towards me. I tugged on my friends arm but she didn't</B>
<BR><B>reply, she was asleep, along with the other 2 people</B>
<BR><B>that were with us. I backed up off the grave as the</B>
<BR><B>white one glared at me. When I got completely away</B>
<BR><B>they had turned their eyes back to eachother and</B>
<BR><B>vanished.</B>
<BR><B>(I don't exactly know what you are going to say to the</B>
<BR><B>stories. It may just be my over active imagination</B>
<BR><B>with this all or it could actually have happened. I do</B>
<BR><B>believe in ghost, although I am only 14 now. I try not</B>
<BR><B>to harm any ghosts any more and I wish to join your</B>
<BR><B>group, although my young age. Stranger things have</B>
<BR><B>happened to me and my friends at one time...but I</B>
<BR><B>can't recall the exact details at this moment to write</B>
<BR><B>them out, I have tried to forget.)</B>
