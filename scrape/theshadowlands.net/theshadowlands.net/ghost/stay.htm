<P><B><FONT FACE="Arrus BT">An earthbound spirit is a human spirit that
has not properly passed over.&nbsp; They have not gone onto the next level,
the light, heaven, whatever you choose to call it.&nbsp; They remain behind,
here on earth, and they account for many ghost sightings and haunted places.</FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arrus BT"></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arrus BT">The reasons for this are varied.&nbsp; Some
are complicated and unique to that spirit and others are simple to understand
and relate too.&nbsp; I will discuss a few of the most common reasons that
a spirit remains earthbound.</FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arrus BT"></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arrus BT">Some spirits remain at or near the site of
their death, especially if it was sudden and unexpected.&nbsp; They remain
confused and don't know or accept that they have died.&nbsp; These spirits
remain in the area and try to make contact with anyone that passes by that
is sensitive to spirits.&nbsp; This type of spirit can be found almost
anywhere a death has occurred.</FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arrus BT"></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arrus BT">Sometimes a spirit realizes that it is dead
and that life continues beyond that.&nbsp; They do not go to the light
for reasons such as the fear that their existence will end, fear of the
unknown, fear of going to hell or being judged for past deeds.&nbsp; These
spirits are bound here because of their own fears.</FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arrus BT"></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arrus BT">Other spirits stay behind to take care of unfinished
business.&nbsp; It may be to make sure their finances and their loved ones
are ok or to pass along one final message.&nbsp; Often these earthbound
spirits do not remain here for long, once they can complete their goal,
they normally pass over.&nbsp; If the deed that they are attempting to
finish is complicated they will often contact the living to assist them.&nbsp;
In many cases the living are unsure of what the spirit wants and it adds
to the length of the time the spirit spends here.&nbsp; Almost anything
that a spirit feels compelled to do before it goes to the light can make
it remain here until it feels comfortable with how they have left things.</FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arrus BT"></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arrus BT">Guilt can also be a reason for a spirit being
stuck here.&nbsp; They may feel like they have left the family or loved
ones too soon and uncared for.&nbsp; This is also the main reason why suicide
victims and other spirits whose death was caused by their actions (alcoholics,
drug overdose, etc) remain behind.&nbsp; They feel guilty over taking their
life or contributing to their death.</FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arrus BT"></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arrus BT">The living can also hold a spirit here.&nbsp;
By not letting go of them, they can be bound here by our love and unable
or unwilling to go on until the living can come to terms with the loss.&nbsp;
This happens when people go beyond the normal grieving process and become
obsessed with the deceased person.&nbsp; They feel that they left things
unsaid, undone, etc. and they feel guilt over it.&nbsp; This keeps the
spirit from going over many times simply because it does not want us to
feel this way or be that upset.</FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arrus BT"></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arrus BT">There are many other reasons that a spirit
cam remain earthbound, I have just touched on a few of the most commonly
encountered ones here.</FONT></B>
