<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By: chavan.prasad@gmail.com </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>My name is Prasad Chavan. I am from <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">India</st1:place></st1:country-region>. I have a
personal Experience of Ghost. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>It happened at the village called SINDHROT which is on the
outskirts of the <st1:City w:st="on">BARODA</st1:City> city in <st1:place w:st="on">Gujarat</st1:place> state. Me and some of my friends went on a short
trip to sindhrot for a fun as it is famous place for the near by city couples
for entertainment and getting some loneliness for romance. we were 9 friends on
5 vehicles. all were coupled except me as my bike was having some starting
troubles and no battery power and to be frank, i even didnt had any girl in my
life those days. we started at 5:30 PM when its not at all dark. city gets dark
after 6:30 pm. it was a very narrow road without any dividers for the opp side
traffic to pass by. so we had only half the road to move ahead. we were going
all one behind another with a distance of 5-6 feets and a pretty low speed.
after crossing the border of the city we entered the village area but still was
1 km away...it was around 6 pm and every thing was visible till your sight
reaches. the road was very narrow and very straight and was followed by trees
on both the corners of the roads. both the sides were covered by muddy mountain
type peaks which are generally seen on the mountain highways. in all the 5
vehicles we had, i was on no. 4 and the distance and speed was almost same as
mentioned earlier. no.1 and no.2 and no. 5 couple didnt see anything which i
and no. 3 had seen passing the same way with same speed. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Me and the couple ahead me saw a girl standing on the opp
side of the road under a tree. standing still, looking very straight. i reduced
my speed and same did the couple ahead me. no. 5 overtook us. and we stopped
looking at the girl just in front of her. she was wearing a kurta pyjama with a
chunri. her hair and chunri and the lower part of the kurta was blowing in the
wind. (BUT THERE WAS NO WIND AT ALL). everything in her was shadowed. her face
was half built. half eyes, half nose, cut lips. as if some body left a statue
of a girl half made. she was making a whispering sound saying go back go back
dont enter the village with girls....her voice was echoing. the girl with us on
no.5 couple saw and heard her and burst out with a cry. somehow we managed to
convince her and go ahead with the trip. we told her not to tell anybody about
what we saw as it would spoil their moods. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>we went ahead and found everyone waiting for us...we rescued
on their questions saying that my bike brokedown as everybody was aware with
the problem of my bike. finally we reached the village at around 6:45 pm.
parked our bikes at a corner and went inside. after a small walk we found an
overbridge where we decided to rest for some time. all the couples found their
spots for romance and went in different corners. we 3 of the victims stayed
together and were leaning into the river from the bridge walls. it was almost
7:30 pm and all dark. while we 3 of us were leaning towards the river, i felt
like somebody is opening arms and trying to pull me inside the river. i gave it
up and told other two what i felt and they said that they also felt the same
thing. meanwhile all couples from every corner of the bridge gathered on one
spot in the middle of the bridge and started staring at one anothers faces
without saying anything...it was really a very unhealthy climate which was
giving a kind of anxiety and restlessness. the victim girl in us broke the
silence and asked what happened to the couples. a guy from one couple said that
he was sitting with his girl friend on a corner and felt like somebody is
pulling him inside the river. he literally felt the touch of hands on his back
and his shirt all out of pants and creased. a girl from another couple added
the same feeling and the third accepted to have the same feeling. the victim
girl started crying and told all of them about what we saw and heard earlier. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>It was now almost 7:50 pm and the weather started chilling.
nothing but the darkness was seen all the four sides. everybody was scared by
this horrible real life event and rushed towards the bikes to get out of this
hell. all bikes started hurrying the roads. my bike was not having headlight,
so i asked one of my friend to be with me to help me spot the road...a little
ahead, Truck came from behind and blowed horn to find some road to go ahead. my
friend who was driving besides me moved ahead and full of scare he drove very
fast and went out of sight. truck too passed away and as this was quite less
scary for anyones wonders my bike borkedown and what i saw was the same bloody
spot exactly under the same tree where i saw that witch. i tried hard to get
out of it, but was not able to start it or push it ahead by hands. i was fully
scared to death. i took my hand on the back carriage to hold the bike from back
to push it ahead. my hand felt a soft touch. i turned back and saw that the
same girl was standing behind with a hold on the bike. it was the most
horrifying scene of my life. i lost my breathes for some seconds and my bike
fall down. i stood straight, senseless, my body stiff, hard and icecold. my
eyes saw nothing but that witch in front of me. she whispered with echo- 'Go
Back and never come here with a girl'....' i leave you because you were the
only person without any girl.' and she disappeared in the dark. after a second
i came to my senses and found my bike fall on the road and me standing alone in
the weird place which had only thing Darkness. i was still scared but was aware
of the fact now that she wont harm me...so relaxed a bit, and as god blessed
me, my bike started in the 4th kick. i rushed out of that place somehow. after
crossing the village borders, i found my friends standing outside a mulitplex
theatre which was newly built in that area especially for the couples who can
go there rather going to that village. i went to my friends, freshen up myself,
had a cup of tea and told them what happened. no body believed meata first
go...but one of the ciggaratte shopkeeper, was listening me and jumped into the
conversation supporting me saying that its true. when asked, he admitted that 6
months back some group of 5 came here out of which 4 were boys and one was a
girl having a relation with one of those 4 guys. her boyfriend hired a hut from
the villager and took the girl inside and had sex with her. she was knowing
that her boyfriend brought her here for sex and was ready for that, but was
unaware of the fact that his friends are also going to have a taste of her with
all legal permissions of her boyfriend. she tried to escape but was unsucessful
and was raped by all four again and again for the whole night. later on in the
early morning she committed suicide in the river. her dead body was found after
a weeks time exactly under the bridge with eyes wide open and face all swollen
and crashed from different parts. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>she does not appear publicly everytime. she becomes visible
only on moonless nights which was unfortuantely the night we were there. she
harms the boys who bring a girl with them along with other boys. and warns the
lonely couples not to come here and play with a girl. but this happens only
once in a month on moonless nights. rest days she is not visible but is active
in those areas. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>This is a real time haunted place to visit. but you will see
her troublesome only if you are with a group of boys and your girlfriend with
you. This real life incidence may seem to be very dramatic and unreal. but its
a fact. which at least i cannot deny to have faith in the invisible world of
the ghosts between the earth and the sky. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Thanks for the patience to read it with hands on heart. </big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">&nbsp;</span>I was in my father's
computer room playing on the net when i felt as if i was being watched. Looking
up i saw a girl peeking around the door frame at me. She wore a plain white
gown and had long brown-black hair tied in a braid covering half her face. She
was only there for a second then she was gone but i guess she wasent finished
with me later on i had a dream she was talking to me she told me her name was
Francis Sarah S.(i couldent make out the last name) but to call her Sarah she
told me she was tied to the land around my house. When i woke up i told her she
was welcome here like George(our other spirit) if she wished to stay and i
think she has.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>When I was 23 to 25<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>years old, 1979 - 1981, I got married and we moved into an old 3 story
home, with a basement, in the old part of <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Springfield</st1:City>,
 <st1:State w:st="on">Missouri</st1:State></st1:place>. The home was built in
what I would guess to be around 1910 to 1925? The home was once heated with
coal from the basement. In the basement I always felt like I was being watched.
We spent most of our time on the first floor. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>One night I got up in the middle of the night to go to the
bathroom. I walked out of the bedroom into the hallway and noticed in the
living room that the tv set was on. I looked at it and it was only static on
the screen, and the sound was turned down. My thoughts were that my wife was
tired and turned it down instead of turning it off. When I got back into bed I
woke her and told her that I turned the tv off. She laughed and said that she
turned the tv off. She insisted that I get up and check thru the house to make
sure all doors were locked and that no one was in the house. I did and all was
fine. ....A few months later, my wife had taken vacation time from work and
went to <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">St. Louis</st1:place></st1:City>
to visit her relatives. That Saturday night I was alone and was drinking a few
beers and listening to music in a room next to the living room. All the lights
were off and I had lit two candles. It was just after midnight and I decided to
go to bed. Turned the stereo off and blew out the candles. I walked into the
living room and I froze in my steps as the tv set was on, only static and the
sound was turned down. I was afraid to look behind me as I stared at the tv
set. I finally looked behind me but nothing was there. I immediately walked
thru the house turning all the lights on, lookin under beds and in closets.
Nothing was discovered. I was not even going down in that basement! I went to
bed and locked my bedroom door!........A few months later it was springtime. I knew
of a place down by the river that was being plowed up by a farmer. I had been
finding arrowheads in the plowed field. My wife and I went to the plowed field
and I found some arrowheads to bring back and clean off with an old toothbrush.
I could see my wife in the kitchen making dinner as I sat in a chair cleaning
the artifacts. Before I had set down I pushed the power button on the stereo so
I could listen to the rock radio station. After about 5 minutes the sound went
off. I thought that it was the station just going off the air for a few
minutes. I finally decided to put an album on to listen to. I looked up at the
stereo and the lights were off.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I hollared at my wife and asked if she turned the stereo
off? She said no she did not trun it off. I said that the lights were off. She
came in and stood in front of the stereo. I got up and stood next to her. The
power cord was contected in the wall power socket. I took my finger and pushed
the power button and the stereo rock station came on. I told her that the only
way that it could have gone off was the power button had to be pushed. She said
that this place is haunted and we have to get out of here. We lived there 1
more year before moving.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I live in an average suburban home built about 30 years ago.
I also live in the oldest city in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">America</st1:place></st1:country-region>, St.Augustine. I don't know
if that has anything to do with the things I have seen in pictures taken in my
house, but maybe. I think the first thing that happened was what my sister
recently told me. She said that last year she started seeing a white misty lady
in the hallway if she went to bed too late. She felt that this lady was some
kind of housekeeper or nurse and that she was telling her to go to sleep. A
couple weeks ago, I was looking at some pictures on my computer that I had
taken a couple months ago with my digital camera. I had never really looked at
the pictures too closely, and soon after, my camera started taking weird
pictures and then it died for no reason. So, I was looking at the pictures and
I saw one that had my sister and my cat in it. We have a widescreen computer so
it zooms in on the pictures and for the first time, I noticed that she was
standing next to a glass cabinet and I saw a figure in the reflection. It was a
black figure that looked like a man wearing a tall hat. I saw another picture
of my other cat drinking out of the toilet. On the side of the toilet, I saw a
large cat's face. My cat's head was in the tiolet, so it couldn't be his
reflection. About a week ago, I was talking on the phone with my friend in the
garage and my cat was in there too. Suddenly, he started staring at the wall
when nothing was there. His eyes got all wide and he flattened his ears back
and fluffed out his tail. He does that when he's scared or mad. I got the
creeps really bad and ran out of the room. Also, when I was about five years
old, I lived in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Jacksonville</st1:place></st1:City>
with my dad, grandma, and sister. My grandma started having health problems and
died soon after. My dad, sister and I moved around for a while before settling
down with his new wife in St.Augustine when I was about 8, but now I'm 14 and I
just started feeling like whenever I'm in the kitchen, My grandma is with me.
She loved to cook when she was alive. One more thing that happened was I went
out into the garage and closed the door behind me. I picked up a big basket
full of laundry and walked back toward the door, only to find that it was
already open. I walked in and said," Thanks Grandma," and the door closed
again.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>The House in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Detroit</st1:place></st1:City></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By: amrhs888@yahoo.com </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>THE HOUSE IN DETROIT<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>in 2001<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I moved into a house in
an area in <st1:place w:st="on">Southwest Detroit</st1:place> known as
Mexicantown. My best friend had died in 1998, and my Dad in 2002. I never had
any personal experiences with the paranormal, till we moved into that house
,which was over 85 years old.Although my Mom saw the white<span style="">&nbsp; </span>smoky form of her dead Aunt, when she was
little, coming up the stairs at her, when she got up in the middle of the night.
They laid bodies out in their own homes back then, around 1930.that was in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Rochester</st1:City> <st1:State w:st="on">New
  York</st1:State></st1:place>.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Anyway, I was 45,
and had been living in the <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Detroit</st1:place></st1:City>
house for a few years, when I started hearing voices talking upstairs, when I
was home alone. I could never make out what they were saying, but it seemed
they were men, 2 or 3, arguing about me. I also heard heavy footsteps,( the
floor creaked really bad, the wood was really old.)and windows opening, but
would be scared to death, and go upstairs ,armed with a metal pipe, thinking
someone was breaking in, to rape or kill me.( it WAS Detroit), but no-one was
ever there. No-one else ever heard anything. I've heard that seeing ghosts
sometimes runs in the family, like my Mom, but I hope my daughter never does.
Anyway, One of the scariest thing that ever happened to me was that I was in
the kitchen at night, my boyfriend was in the livingroom watching T.V. and
nothing would take him away from that !, but I was cooking something, and heard
my name,"Andrea" spoken right behind me. I walked into the livingroom,
and asked ,"did you call me?" but he didn't. Also, I would lose
something, and look everywhere for it, 3 times, even, then find it sitting
right in the middle of my bed, where there was nothing 2 minutes before. Also,
this Teddy bear I had with a music chip in it's paw, went off by itself one day
3 times, hours apart. and nothing was touching it, or up against the paw. It
never happened before, and never since. But the Scariest thing happened in the
kitchen again, when I was home alone one day, I hated going in the basement,
and I always felt watched when I was down there. I had to go down there for
something, and hurried back as quick as I could. I was standing in the kitchen,
fixing my lipstick in my compact mirror, and behind me in the mirror, I saw a
black hooded figure. There was nothing even remotely that color in that room,
and it scared me to death. I also got cold spots in the house in 90 degree
weather,(and we had no A/C, and no door open at this time, or fan on. I stood
in the cold spot and felt like someone came up behind me and poked me in both
sides with ice cold fingers. I don't think that my friend or my Dad would have
scared me, but maybe they were doing the little funny things, (ex: teddy bear,
misplacing items) to let me know they were looking out for me, and maybe
protecting me. My Dad brought us up Catholic, and I*'m sure he's in a good
place, so was my best friend. I now went back to going to Church every Sunday,
and hope that my Faith will protect us from further dark spirits. My Daughter
(now 13) and I moved out of that house, and my ex-boyfriend, would never admit
if he DID hear anything, or see anything, he's one of those "if I can't
see or touch it, I don't believe in it", type of people. I hope he never
does, either, he's got a high blood pressure problem. So far, I've not
experienced anything in my new place, and I hope I never will either.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>True Story: The Running Girl</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By: [store05@utrecht.com </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I only have one ghost story in my life, but I still think
about it often. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>About 12 years ago I
lived in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Westland</st1:City>, <st1:State w:st="on">MI</st1:State></st1:place>, where I was born and lived until I was
32.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Westland</st1:place></st1:City> is as boring a suburb as you can
imagine, and my encounter was about the only thing interesting to relate from
my neighborhood.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I was driving home late one night in late December.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anyone who has spent a winter in <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Michigan</st1:place></st1:State> can tell you
that it gets very very cold, and the night in question was one of the coldest I
remember&#8230;it was hard to even breathe when you were out in the bitter wind.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>It was probably just after midnight, and I had just spent a
few hours with one of my college friends working on a graphic design project
that was due shortly after our return from a short holiday break.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was only about a block from my house and
was driving very carefully because the streets were icy and narrow, any swerve
would cause me to collide with the cars parked along the residential street.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>All of a sudden, I became aware of a flash of white in my
peripheral vision, off to my right.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
looked very quickly and saw a girl in white running down the sidewalk, a
flowing white nightdress trailing behind her.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She was pale and had long black hair, which also blew wildly in the
harsh wind.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was obviously not
dressed for a <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Michigan</st1:place></st1:State>
December and I remember distinctly noting that she was BAREFOOT!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She had a red ribbon tying her hair at her
neck in a loose pony-tail.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I still remember that there was a strange quality to the
vision, as if I was seeing an old memory, there was some strange &#8220;otherness&#8221; to
it that I can only attempt to describe:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>she seemed to move at a slightly slower speed than normal, but not quite
as slow as you may describe as &#8220;slow motion&#8221;&#8230;also, I have no recollection of
any sound at all during that brief moment, not even the sound around me, like
the car engine or the wind gusting&#8230;</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I looked back and saw her again, her pace now leaving her
almost behind me, I had turn my head to spot her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, I couldn&#8217;t look for long without
risking an accident, so I slowed the car down and tried to spot her a third
time.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>She was gone.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I did not see any doors closing on any of the nearby houses
or any other persons in the immediate vicinity.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I stopped the car near the corner and, after pondering for a
few seconds, got out to investigate.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I went to the area where I had seen her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It had been snowing pretty steadily since
sunset and the sidewalks were covered with about 3 inches of fresh snow.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>There were absolutely no tracks, either on the sidewalk or
the lawns nearby.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I stood there for a minute and then walked around the perimeter
in a circle covering about 40 feet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
was definitely the spot I had seen her, but there was no tracks but my own.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>In the weeks and months after this first happened, I tried
to write the experience off as a trick of my mind, but I have never had any
other &#8220;visions&#8221; since, and I have now accepted that this was a ghost.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I didn&#8217;t know the people on that street and
never investigated who this girl might have been.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thanks for listening.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>A Voice Calling My Name</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By: Blusuzz@aol.com</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I was having a normal day untill... I stayed up until around
1 Am. I was tired, but stayed on the web-site I was on and answering mails. I
was scared, because it get's so cold in the computer room at the time when no
one is in there with me... as I was typing in stuff on my profile, I felt a
chill threw my whole body. So, I was so scared to go out in the living room to
get a blanket, but I did any way. It felt like there was a spirit watching what
you were doing in that room.... all the other rooms feel that way too. My whole
house feels that way.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, as I was
typing more on my profile, something said my name "Michala...." I got
freaked out, and stayed on the computer. And I always see things in the mirror,
when I am brushing my hair. I see me, but much much sadder, and brighter blue
eyes, and a modern time like. I always draw pictures of 'me' but let's just
call that person... Isabella... but now, I have scratches on my hands, and you
can see my vains! I didn't even do anything to get them scratched! But... me
and my friend are doing research. She said this spirit she talks to at this
haunted house wants to kill me because I remind him of 'Isabella' But I don't
know why he does.... I see him in my dreams telling me "I will kill
you" But he is a blonde boy, my age. It's creepy!!!!!!!! </big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>for years, me and my friend halley were best friends. like
we were inseperable. our parents would even let us have sleepovers together,
since we literally treated<span style="">&nbsp; </span>each other
like a sibling, but with less argueing (not that we didn't have our disputes.)
so we've known each other since we were six. now we are both sixteen, and i was
starting to develop a crush on her. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>but anyways. we both were always firm believers of the
supernatural. there has always been this stretch behind some houses in our
neighborhood. no kids would DARE go into the ravine, because there was this
neighborhood story that some bodies were found there, and that crazy stuff
happened there when kids walked through. one kid even claimed he saw the devil,
but we never believed him.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>so one night, we were walking home, and i was working up the
guts to tell her how i felt. then she tugged my sleeve and whispered 'what in
the world is that?!' and pointed. the ravine usually is fairly well lit at
night from the house lights, but it seemed pitch black. there was a sort of
sillouhette<span style="">&nbsp; </span>of a man, but he had... the
best way to describe them were spikes protruding from him. it had a menacing
aura, and everybody i know will admit that i seem to pick up vibes better than
anyone else they know; i've gotten us out of all kinds of crap. so, without
even relizing it, halley ended up telling me, but i walked between halley and
it and got out my knife. now, i do remember being scared as all get out, but somehow
calm. i wasn't comforted much by my loose, dull, two inch blade. but then it
seemed to envelop me; i couldn't breathe or think,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>i just remember thinking about how here was
NO WAY in hell i was going to let anything happen to halley, and it was off of
me, and was almost repelled by us, and then like the flick of a switch, it was
gone. this all took place in a matter of maybe two minutes, but according to
Halley, I was yelling at it, and was bigger in stature than usual.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>since then, i have been noticing the finer things in the
occult ( noticing figures, shapes, ethereal movement) and we have been an
inseparable couple.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Ghost Experience</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By: maderar@mail.com</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>First I want to tell you about myself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I've been seeing ghost since I was a little
boy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am not the type of person that
every noise or every shadow that I see it is paranormal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is the first time that I'm going to tell
my story.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I never told my experiences to
anyone because I was afraid that people would think that I was strange or a liar.
I speak Spanish so please forgive me for their mistake in my writing. So here
is my story:</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>a.. This story was in 1970, I was 11 years old.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sometime when I used to go to the store was a
girl that was so cute that I got a crush on her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I didn't know where she lives.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One night I went to my best friend house and
we was at the front porch talking and to my surprise that girl was in the
living room, so I asked my friend about her and he said she was his sister best
friend and they was going to school tonight to see a movie about child
birth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So I told him about my crush and
if we walk them to school so I can know her.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>So we did and we talked for a little bit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We arrive at school and the girl and my
friend&#8217;s sister went inside the home room to watch the movie.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Five minutes later this girl came out and
said that she can not see the movie because she don't have her parents
signature. So to make a long story short she and I were walking around school
talking.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We end up on the back of the
school next to the fence on the ground was an old tree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Behind the fence the ground goes down about 5
feet and after that, is an open field with tree and very tall grass.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We sit on the old tree with our back touching
the fence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were talking and around 10
minutes later she gets the shills.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
looks to her left and right and then she keep talking.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A couple of minutes later I was talking and
she gets the shills so she looks to her left and right again and then she keep
listening to me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I did not ask her
what's wrong because I didn't want her to feel uncomfortable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So I keep talking and in a couple minutes
later she gets the shills but at the same time I get the shills too.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again she looks left and right and then she
continue looking at me but then she looked behind her and what she saw she got
so scare that she went to scream but she couldn't, her eyes was wide open and
her mouth too but no sound. Next she takes me my arm and put her face on my
shoulder so I look back and I saw a woman coming to us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was floating on top of the grass.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I saw her I got up so quick that I
became loose from the girl.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I looked at
this woman and her face looks like she was very angry and very hateful.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was wearing a very or fashion dress.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The color of the dress was purple and blue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The material of the dress was like silk but
of a very heavy material.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I kept looking
at that woman and she kept getting closer to us. I don't know if she was
looking at the girl, at me or the two of us.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They expression on her face was so hateful that until this day I never
forgot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So I was looking at this woman
and then I looked at the girl and she was paralyzed of fear looking at me, so
I'd look back to the woman and she was getting closer and closer and the same
time I was feeling shill on my back and I fell that my stomach was
burning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I believe that we had a
guardian angel watching over us because with out hesitation or thinking I
grabbed the girl arm and pulled her up and ran away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We did not stop running until we reach the
parking lot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When we stop at a parking
lot the girl started<span style="">&nbsp; </span>crying, my friend
show up and asked me what happened and because was other people around I told
him that she's not feeling well and she probably is getting the flue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I took a girl home and to my surprise her mom
knows very well my mom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I told her mom
that she is not feeling very well. I didn't say what really happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her mom put her hand on her forehead and said
that she was very cold.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So I went
home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Two days later I stopped at her
house to see how she was doing and she said she was feeling better.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I didn't mention anything of what happened at
school so after a couple of minutes later she said to me &#8220;Tony, did you really
see that woman that was coming to us?"<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Because I didn't say anything about a man or woman I know that we did
see the same thing.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">&nbsp; </span>b.. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">&nbsp; </span>c.. I don't know if
any of you had the same experience that I did and if you did I would like to
know about it. After that experience, this girl and I lost contact with each
other because her family move and then my family move. If she read this story
she will know and maybe she can get in touch whit me.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This is one of many others experience than
I had with ghost.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Many off my experience
with ghost I was lucky to have somebody with me so I</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>My Grandparents Basement</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By: outlaw.brigade@gmail.com</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I'm not really sure where to begin; I have many awful
accounts and a lot of background to base them on. Well, ever since I was a
little girl, I have always enjoyed staying at my grandparent's house. They live
two states away, so it was a big treat to get to see them and enjoy their house
for a few weeks. While my grandparents still lived in the house, a baby died in
their home with the parent's present, but that is the only explanation for
these occurrences.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>They are delightful
people and I love them dearly, but their basement is definitely haunted by a
negative energy. I often have to sleep in the extra bed located downstairs. I
stay in that basement annually and every visit I get very, very sick. I am a
relatively healthy eighteen year old that never gets sick enough to even vomit,
but each time I sleep in that basement I acquire strep throat or stomach flu
and if not either of those, something makes me vomit no matter what. This
negative energy is simply named, "Fred" and is considered a joke by
both my grandparents and also my great grandma who has a room in the basement
where she lives. Fred used to do simple things like turn lights on and off
before I was born. He has always kept a close watch on me, though. At night I
would stay up until 4am because I felt his presence watching from behind and I
was afraid to turn off the lights and go to sleep. I could definitely feel
something watching me whenever I was in the basement; it was just more
frightening at night when everyone was asleep. One night I went upstairs to get
something to eat and I caught sight of the shadow of a head and shoulders
passing across a beam of light on the wall. My heart jumped and then I rationed
that it must have been my own shadow, until I took a step forward and
recognized my own messy hair and facial structure in the new shadow. Later, I
lay in bed with the lights on at 3am trying to decide if I should go to sleep.
Finally, I turn the lights out and lay my head on the pillow. As soon as I do
my bed starts to shake violently. I am so scared my mouth goes dry and I am
unable to move. In a burst of courage, I jump up and turn on the light. The
shaking stops and there is no visible culprit. The family cat refuses to step
foot in the basement and my uncle, my brother and my mother feel the unpleasant
ghost lurking there. One day while only my great grandma and my grandparents
are staying in the home, they are discussing Fred and how ludicrous the idea of
him existing is. My great grandma goes to descend the staircase and yells in
spite, "I'm coming down stairs, Fred!" Suddenly, the round glass
light fixture at the bottom of the stairs bursts into a million pieces.
Recently, my grandparents have replaced their ancient furnace located downstairs
and the ghostly happenings have stopped. I am still wary of the basement, and I
am still frightened by the memories that were created there.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>When I was Young</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By: ozhighlander2@sbcglobal.net</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I was only 10 or 11 when I actually saw something I couldn't
explain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I was 4, I remember
hangers moving in my closet one night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
was to young to know about ghosts and such. The boogie man was more my frame of
mind. But other than that I can't say I had any other experiences until then.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>My parents seemed to enjoy buying old houses and restoring
them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We would spend a few years on a
farm house and then they would sell when they found something new. I suppose
this is where I learned to enjoy old things as well.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This particular house was a bit more
primitive than the ones before.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It had
no plumbing and was pretty much the same I believe from the time it was
built.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was the 70's and the people
we purchased the house from were the original owners and their family built the
house and barns.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I often marveled at the
prospect of using the outhouse in the middle of winter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>From the moment I entered this house I felt uneasy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The house seemed dark and not homey.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was more comfortable outside in the old
barn than I was in the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As work
began in the late summer we lived in a travel trailer because there were no
modern conveniences.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was fine with
this arrangement, we worked on the house when dad came home from work and on
weekends.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Eventually the seasons changed
and winter was coming.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dad managed to get
the new windows in, insulated and sheetrock.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The plumbing was in and we finally had a real bathroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>My story really begins here.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This house had only two bedrooms that were upstairs and they had the
slanted ceilings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We later added on,
adding two new bedrooms and a bath.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I can still feel the odd feeling of presence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At 10, I'm sure I didn't know that, but now I
do.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before the room was finished for me
and my two sisters we would play up there when the weather didn't allow us
outside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sometimes I would stop at the
doorway and feel very uneasy about going in alone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I remember my sisters looking at me strange
and bursting into the room without hesitation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My oldest sister asked me why I looked that way, the only thing I
remember saying is that a baby died here.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I guess she thought I was trying to scare her.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>She just looked at me and said I was stupid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Weeks later the room was ready for us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was exciting to move out of the trailer
and have some real space but I still wouldn't go upstairs without someone with
me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I would make a point of going to bed
when my sister did. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>One Night my sister went to baby-sit for our neighbors down
the road.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I knew I was going to be alone
in the room and tried everything to stay up until she came home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mom and Dad made<span style="">&nbsp; </span>was sure I went to bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was a long night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I stayed awake with my covers up around my
neck.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Around 11:30 I heard my sister
come home. I was relieved to say the least. Up to this time I was scared.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Don't know why really just didn't feel right
about this room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I saw my sis get
into bed I felt safe and fell to sleep.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I don't know what time is was or even how long I had been asleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Something woke me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My covers were falling off my bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I remember pulling them back up around me and
being almost mad that they weren't staying up.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I guess I was half asleep because I had just readjusted the covers again
when they slowly began to pull away from me.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At this point I opened my eyes and at the foot of my bed was a figure of
a lady with a long full skirt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
looked misty but diffidently a human shape.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Her dress seemed pink in the moonlight.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She stood there and stared at me.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I couldn't move.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I wanted to
scream or run but couldn't move.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
remember trying to yell to my sister but nothing was coming out of my mouth.
Finally I just made the decision to run and jumped off my bed and ran through
her to my sisters bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I looked
back the figure was gone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sis didn't
know what was going on. I told her what I had just seen and I just wanted to
stay with her tonight.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She knew I was
scared because I never ask to sleep in her bed, ever.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>The next day I tried to recall everything I'd seen the night
before.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sis said she thought she had
seen something too, but she was more asleep than awake.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She said she thought she saw a misty cloud in
front of my bed and then me running over to her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have never tried to find out any history of
the house, we moved a year or so later and it didn't seem to matter anymore.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since then I have had several
experiences.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Most of these involve
dreams that come true.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I still have
those feelings of uneasiness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Usually
when I enter a home I've never been in before I can kind of sense if the house
is OK or not.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It's like I critique the
home before I will enter again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sometimes
I want to know more and sometimes I don't!</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Experiences in My Birth House</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By: frm@tiscali.nl </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Things happened when I was a very little boy.At the age of 4
it started and already felt,that our house had something particular.Before I
knew about the existance of monsters or ghosts I already was scared in the
house.Until my 10th year I always slept with my mother in the same room,but I
never asked for that and I never told about my fear,such things go by
themselves.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>One night at about 3pm a big painting fell from the wall
with a loud bang.My father couldn't believe it but yet it happened.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>In the dark I spotted,that the ceiling corners of the room
we slept in,were not always the same;in 1 of the 4 corners once I spotted
s.thing having the shape of a human head with a cap.Other times in that same
corner it was not quite there an sometmes I couls perceive a faint light
there,if I concentrated painstakingly on that.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Another time I couldn't find my mother in the house,although
she was there(my father was at work)Seemingly she was nowhere to be seen,until
I heard st.in the kitchen,and yes,one of the little doors of the sink unit was
fingerthick opened,I walked towards,opened the door and....there she was
sitting, completely hunched together underneath the sink drain!!We'll never
know,what had happened there,the only thing my mother cryingly said she had
bumped her head,growing older I thought to myself:hadn't there been another
explanation?But you know as well,such things are taboo to talk about!</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>After darkfall I sometimes could hear faint noises on te
stairs and on the upper gangway.And some months later again after twilight,a
thunder was coming up.There was a huge lightning strike,right in front of the
house(10 meters distance)with an undescribable loud blow!Which made my promptly
dive into the bed in the room I was.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Later we moved out of the house and now I'm 61 having been
returned to my birth place and I heard that the same house had been standing
twice vacant for a long time and the folks moving in,didn't stay for long,a
brokerdid confirm this to me,after telling him.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>The odd thing is,my fondest wish is to return into that
hose,but I can't get a mortgage.After moving out of that house all things in my
life went wrong(nothing but prevations and hardships,no job,no partner efc!!!!)</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I think,I've arrived at the following conclusion:The ghosts
in the house we harmless,quite in the contrary,they had been trying to warn
me,NOT to leave the house</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Lost Little Girl</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By: h.miller@acs.kent.sch.uk</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>My name is Helen, and I'm a rational wife and mother of two.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I have experienced psychic phenomenon ever since anybody can
remember, "seeing" things almost before I could talk.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>This is my most recent experience, We moved to our house in
1991, From the moment we moved in I felt a presence. Occasionally I would hear
footsteps upstairs, light ones like a child running. My mother when she was
alone in the house would also hear them. After the birth of my first child, a
daughter this increased. When my daughter started to talk she would come in the
night or cryout, that Jamie had woken her up to play ( Jamie is my niece, so to
evie any girl of about 3/4years with blonde hair was Jamie at that time)</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I wondered at this but since she was not afraid I didn't
worry.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>When I was heavily pregnant with my son, I was resting in
the evening, Daughter was asleep, Hubby was out house was empty, Then I heard
her wake up get out of bed, run along the landing, jump on to the top step and
call "mama",</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Thinking it was Evie I replied "I'm in here dear"
expecting her to come in for a cuddle. There was no sound or movement so I
heaved myself off the bed and went to see her. There was nobody there, I looked
in her room, she was tucked up in bed and fast asleep. This happened to me
quite often after this I would hear the little girl calling her mama. I went to
see a medium and told her, she said the child was lost and next time I should
go to the bottom of the stairs and tell her she needed to go into the light to
find her mum, and then I should recite the lords prayer. So next time I did
this, since then no more footsteps but I still occasionally feel like I'm being
watched. I hope the child found her mum and is at peace now.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I write
this,12-9-07, My event took place about 2-3 weeks ago.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I rent a room in a 2-story house upstairs in the <st1:City w:st="on">san fernando</st1:City> <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType w:st="on">valley</st1:PlaceType>
 of <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">CA USA</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I was dreaming
quite comfortably (I don't remember the dream) and I heard the sound of my
keyboard keys being quickly typed on, IN MY DREAM. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Mind you the desktop pc is only about 10 whole feet from my
head. This sound woke me up and I looked towards the keyboard and continued to
hear the rapid typing noise. I did not feel uncomfortable, scared, or
threatened in any way. I have very bad vision and turned to put my eyeglasses
on to verify what I was obviously (now fully awake) hearing. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I put them on, trying not to startle whatever it was that I
could not see (there was plenty light to see with) as I really wanted a
verification that the keys were actually moving. As I turned back to look at
the keyboard I saw a last couple of keys move and then it </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>stopped. I never saw a presence or even felt one of any
kind.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>chair, of course, was right in front of the keyboard &amp;
it never moved.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I got up and walked the couple steps to the desk and punched
a few keys myself to , again, verify that I actually heard and saw this take
place. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>As if I did not know what my keyboard sounds like.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I then stated out
loud that I did not know who or what it was but that I did not like people
messing with my pc and that whatever it was it should go.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Afterwards, I
thought maybe it was a guide or friend of some sort and simply wanted to make
it's presence known. I have no idea. I did leave akelpad open a couple nights in
a row but there was no activity. I have since replaced the keyboard as it was
old and dirty &amp; I didn't really like it anyways. But not because of this
incidence.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I read a Sylvia
Brown book recently-'Exploring the Levels of Creation' ( I think after this
took place), and she states that everyone has AT LEAST one spirit guide with
them at all times.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I am sure this is
the case, but since I don't know this person nor have they made any contact
directly with me in my entire 41+ years of life, do I even care.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I mainly want to leave my body. I don't like sleeping OR
mundane BS dreaming. But, generally speaking it is an alarming process which
usually takes me by surprise and which is generally accompanied by unknown
presences. Apparently I just need more practice and concentration.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I did it very well
at the tender age of 7 but without any specific direction or input on the
matter it was a failed enterprise. What<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>a shame! As my light body or maybe it was the guide's, lit the living
room up through the door of my room as I was standing in an out of body state.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In any case that
is my story as paltry as it sounds.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I can't wait to face a real haunting-boo hoo</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Singing to Ghosts </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By: bsanders38104@hotmail.com</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>My tale is a bit convoluted, but I&#8217;ll try my best to be as
concise as possible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>About 5 years ago I
was living in a small two bedroom apartment in one of the older areas of the
city with my six year old son.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Most nights
after putting him to bed, I would play music to sing and dance to (a great
stress reliever for me).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On several
occasions my son would shout out to me asking if I could play the music
louder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thinking it to be a bit of an
odd request, I asked him why.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All he
would say was that it would help him sleep.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Well, I figured if he wanted it louder, why not&#8230;I&#8217;ll play it
louder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also, on several occasions,
while I was singing I would get the strangest feeling that there was a presence
in the room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not a good or bad feeling,
just an eerie &#8220;knowing&#8221; that someone/something was in the room with me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Out of nowhere I got this urge to sing
towards my couch in the living room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
felt silly at first, but at the same time it made me feel better.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All of this became a regular custom but not
something I gave any thought to.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>A few months after moving out of these apartments, I was
visiting a friend that still lived in the building.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were looking through some pictures he had
just developed and came across one that caught my attention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was a picture of me and my boyfriend in my
old apartment and right behind us was a white shadowy (kind of like fog) figure
standing behind us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I mentioned the
peculiar shape to the group one of my other neighbors stated, &#8220;Well, you know,
the person who moved in after you only lived there a month.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She said the place was haunted.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Just then my son walked in from outside and
he said, &#8220;Haunted?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Are you talking about
the old lady in our apartment?&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To say
the least, this threw me off a bit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
asked him what he meant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He says all
nonchalant and with a straight face, &#8220;Oh, you know, the old lady that used to
stand at the foot of my bed at night.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Remember, how I asked you to play your music louder?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well, that&#8217;s because it would make her leave
my room.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had completely forgotten
about his requests to play my music louder and my strange urge to sing to my
couch.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, looking back it made
sense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also, that couch was up against
the wall that was shared by my son&#8217;s bedroom.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Not sure if that means anything, just another interesting tidbit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Either way, we were all wide eyed and gaping
to his revelation but it didn&#8217;t seem to bother him a bit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He just grabbed a drink and went back out to
play.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Sunday Night Sighting</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>About 4 years ago, my then boyfriend and I went biking on a
Sunday.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We're distance cyclers so 55
miles later, it was getting dark and we were hungry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We had never been to this restaurant
together, but we'd both been to the Harmony Inn, in Harmony, PA - and agreed it
would be a great place to stop along the way home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The place is old, and is reputed to be
haunted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>When we arrived, the dining room was closed but the bar was
open, and still serving food.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was
almost no one in the place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We sat down
and ordered drinks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I then excused
myself to go to the restroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I exited
the bar to the entryway (the building appears to have been a house at one
time).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The dining room was across the
entryway, and the doors were closed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
bathrooms and a staircase to a 2nd floor were on my right.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As I looked around for the bathroom, my
attention was drawn up the stairs.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There, I saw a woman, who appeared to be wearing an old-fashioned high
collar dress, and an apron.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I couldn't
see all of her, especially because I was looking up.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>She seemed to glance down at me, and then she walked through
a closed door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I wasn't scared, but excited.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I went back to our table and told Dan that I
saw the ghost!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I described her, and he
told me, "No - the ghost haunting this place is a man, everyone knows
that."</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Now - four years later - I want to take my son to the
restaurant, as he is very sensitive, and interested in the paranormal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To gather information about sightings there,
I've been looking up haunted places.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Come to find out - that although the restaurant is famous for its male
ghost, employees often see a woman near the entryway and staircase - mainly
before closing time.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Something Quite Odd</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By: solar_reflective@yahoo.com</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I have been experiencing something quite odd on and off for
the last seven years. I don't know how to feel about it. It is something that
happens when I lay down for the evening. I begin experiencing this tingly
sensation in my temples. It begins in the temple that isn't in contact with the
pillow. IF I allow it, it will spread to encompass my entire body. It is not the
normal, I am so comfortable tingle. I know the difference. It feels quite
UNcomfortable actually, as if I am letting something in that I should not. I
usually start to panic and drive it out. The reason I panic is the sensation
increases in intensity in my groin area. No nice way to say it so I just put it
out there. I am a rational person...I KNOW this sounds like lunacy. I honestly
do.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I know the exact time this started occurring. It wasn't a
gradual thing. It was the summer of 2000. We lived in a very disturbing house
that had a nasty presence inside it. What it was, I don't presume to know. I
never saw it. I wish I could say the same for my 3 year old daughter. We lived
near a military base, <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Ft.</st1:PlaceType>
 <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Bragg</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>, to be exact. We
were close enough to the training area that we could feel the artillery
explosions they used during mock battles. So when my young daughter came to me
to tell that a bad man was in her room that would pick up her bed and drop it.
I assumed she just felt shaking from artillery. I did not take her seriously.
To this day, I deeply regret that. I told her it was just a big butterfly
flapping its wings outside her window.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Early one morning I was putting away laundry. My daughter
was at my mothers for the day, perfect time to catch up on housework. I went
into her room with a full basket of laundry, only to find her bed clear on the
other side of the room. Fear shot my heart straight into my stomach, I knew at
that moment, she was telling the truth. I RAN out of her room. I had a feeling
if I would have looked over my shoulder at that moment, I would have seen
something. But I was not brave enough to test the theory. There is NO WAY she
could have moved the bed herself. After a few minutes of basically hiding, I am
ashamed to admit, I got angry. Angry as hell. Something was in there and it was
bothering my daughter.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>When I picked her up from my mothers, I began to ask her
about the bad man. Her response still has the power to give my the chills to
this day. She told me he comes into her room at night and tells her that I
don't love her. I asked her what the bad man looked like and she said: "a
scary dinosaur". She was three at the time. Too young to intelligently lie
about something of that nature. I felt sick to my stomach. I didn't know who to
go to for help. I ended up going into a forum for the paranormal on the
Internet. I was told by some other individuals to say The Lord's Prayer. I am
not particularly religious, so I had to look it up.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>At the time, I am sitting in broad daylight in the middle of
the afternoon. In fact, I was sitting in direct sunlight because I was beside
the window. I didn't even say it out loud really. I was basically mumbling it
to myself as I am reading through it. I didn't even FINISH it before I was
attacked. Something jumped onto me. I could not see what it was. It just
basically felt like pressure, like being underwater. My ears even popped in. My
vision was distorted as well. wavy as if you were looking over a hot grill. I
did not experience a temperature change. My groin area was tingling like crazy.
I was terrified. It was not my intent to confront the thing in that moment, I
was merely researching. It lasted for what seemed like ages, but in reality.
was probably only a few seconds.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>That was the start of hell inside my house. No longer did it
confine itself to my daughters room. You could hear it walking thought the
hallway at times. That's when I began to have the sensations at night as if
something were putting a tingling pressure on my temples. In that house, nearly
every night this would occur. My husband is Roman Catholic, and a critic. He
would not call me a liar, but it's hard for him to understand my fear when he
is not experiencing anything other than uneasy feelings. I was going through
hell. I was terrified to the point where we decided to move.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>On our last night in the house. I heard it coming down the
hallway. I poked my husband and asked him if he could hear. He crankily told me
to go back to sleep, we have a long day of moving tomorrow. Then he said the
one thing that whatever it was, did not like. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>"There's nothing there anyway, your mind is playing
tricks on you because you're tired."</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Immediately the dryer in the hallway turns on, by itself. He
became so still. I asked him very sarcastically if my mind knows how to turn on
the dryer, think of all the years I wasted turning it on by hand. Then I asked
him what should we do. And quickly he replies NOTHING I'm going back to sleep.
It should be noted that those who helped us move, ALL experienced something in
that house. In the interests of time, and not writing TOO much of a novel here,
I'll spare you the details.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Once we moved, things were better. However from time to
time, I still experience the tingly pressure on my temples. I cannot find any
other story on the web, or from people I have talked to, who have experienced
this same thing. Is there any significance to the temples? I have never figured
out if it was something trying to protect me from the thing in my house, or the
thing itself.</big></p>

address as I am open to hear suggestions and comments from the other readers of
