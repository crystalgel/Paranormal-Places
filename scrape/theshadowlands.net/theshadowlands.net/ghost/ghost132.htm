<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Hello my name is Ashley Bosse' I have lived in three diffrent houses
in</b>
<br><b>my life and at each of them I have had experences.&nbsp; I know
I sound</b>
<br><b>almost parinoid but I trully belive that I am not. first I belive
that</b>
<br><b>there are spirits around us every where.&nbsp; And second humans
on average</b>
<br><b>only use 10% of our brains I belive we have the capabilities to
feel</b>
<br><b>spirits and we have pychic abilities. My most recent experences
are in</b>
<br><b>the house I currently live in.&nbsp; The house is only about 5 years
old but</b>
<br><b>i know spirits dwell here.&nbsp; There are 2 that is sense.&nbsp;
A female who</b>
<br><b>only appers in the hallway late at night. The other is a man who</b>
<br><b>appersin my room and in the spare room.&nbsp; I have had a majority
of my</b>
<br><b>experences with the male spirit.&nbsp; I first felt a presence about
a month</b>
<br><b>after I moved in and every thing was settled in.&nbsp; I felt like
I was</b>
<br><b>being watched but I dismissed it as jitters in a new home. Then
it</b>
<br><b>happened more frequently.&nbsp; Then one morning after a friend
had spent the</b>
<br><b>night.&nbsp; When we awoke we taked for awhile and then as I went
to my</b>
<br><b>closet to get a book when I turned around her face had a very scared</b>
<br><b>look on it she told me when I had my back turned she saw my full
length</b>
<br><b>mioor move and a figure atanding in it she perfectly explaned the
man</b>
<br><b>who I had seen a few weeks earlier.This is about the extant of the</b>
<br><b>ghostly phnomens I have experenced in this house hold. But another
thing</b>
<br><b>I just thought about my animals won't go down there unless I am
w/ them</b>
<br><b>I have 3 cats and 3 dogs they act very parinoyed down there when
I feel</b>
<br><b>perfectly comfortable.&nbsp; Please write me back with your thoughts.

<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Right before Xmas of 1999, I had what I can only call a wierd</b>
<br><b>experience.&nbsp; i am a firm believer in ghosts and the supernatural
and</b>
<br><b>have been told I am psychic as well as experienced unusual things.</b>
<br><b>however, I had never seen anything until that night.&nbsp; for whatever</b>
<br><b>reason, I woke up around 3:00 am to see a man in my bedroom doorway.&nbsp;
I</b>
<br><b>live alone and my 2 cats were asleep on my bed.&nbsp; My first thought
was an</b>
<br><b>intruder and I remember quickly screaming and reaching with one
hand for</b>
<br><b>my phone and the other for the reading lamp on my bed's headboard.&nbsp;
The</b>
<br><b>man was rather large and was wearing jeans and a green plaid shirt.</b>
<br><b>Just as quickly as I saw him, he turned around and silently walked
out</b>
<br><b>of my room.&nbsp; After a minute, I got out of bed with my phone
and walked</b>
<br><b>around my apartment.&nbsp; No one was there and there were no unlocked
doors</b>
<br><b>or windows.&nbsp; What is so unususl is, if it was a true stranger
my cats</b>
<br><b>would of darted under my bed because they are not used to strange
men.</b>
<br><b>Maybe it was a dream but I doubt it.&nbsp; This was too real and
scary.</b>
<br><b>Since then I have seen nothing though my apartment gets very cold
in</b>
<br><b>certain spots during the evening hours.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Hi my name is Lorie. I have my own story to share. It's not so spooky
or</b>
<br><b>scary. More like it's a nice thing. I take after my father's side
of the</b>
<br><b>family. We have an old name. His roots all hailed from West Virginia.
Well</b>
<br><b>one day I visited by not one, but two of my relatives. (long deceased)
One</b>
<br><b>day, while on my grandad's farm, mind you this farm has been in
the family</b>
<br><b>since around the mid 1800's. I was 16 years old. I am now 26. Well,
my mom,</b>
<br><b>dad, and me, were visiting my grandad. (deceased for about 3 yrs)
Well me and</b>
<br><b>grandad were always close. there was this old log cabin that was
built around</b>
<br><b>roughly i think around 1860's. not quite sure, how many generations
were born</b>
<br><b>and died there. i only know stories, from what my grandad has told
me. One</b>
<br><b>day, i was out, wandering around on the acres, and decided to check
out the</b>
<br><b>log cabin. Well, I walked by it, and swore up and down, i had seen
a pioneer</b>
<br><b>like lady. her hair was in a bun. apron, long dress. she was smiling
at me,</b>
<br><b>through the window. i was shocked. Didn't know if I was seeing things.
Mind</b>
<br><b>you, I was the major tomboy, here. okay, no make up, baggy clothes,
short</b>
<br><b>bobbed hair. I heard something call me, but not by my name. She
said,</b>
<br><b>"Samual, come here. Boy get in here." I looked around. Knowing I
am no</b>
<br><b>Samual." I wasn't scared, more like surprised. Well, what I had
done, was I</b>
<br><b>went in there. Opened the door, and a gush of cold, cold, damp air,
flew</b>
<br><b>right past me. Mind you this is summer, humidity and all of that.
Hottest</b>
<br><b>month of the year in 1990. July. Well, I went in there. And I didn't
see her.</b>
<br><b>I was kind of sad. I decided to investigate. I found, an old trunk.
I opened</b>
<br><b>it and found a photo album of all pictures. Actual tin type or whatever
they</b>
<br><b>were. And I seen this boy. That stood out. From all of them. I could
barely</b>
<br><b>read the name. He was in a uniform. Civil war kind of uniform. I
brought it</b>
<br><b>to my grandad. I showed it to him. He just smiled. I pointed to
the picture.</b>
<br><b>And I asked him. "Grandad who is this boy?"&nbsp; He couldn't read
it very well.</b>
<br><b>But, he had anouther photo book. That he kept in the house. He pulled
it,</b>
<br><b>nonchalantly, like it was nothing and looked through it. Together
me and him</b>
<br><b>found some names, and some more pictures. Sure enough, His name
was "Samual</b>
<br><b>James Pringle" He looked at me and said. "Where did you find this,
sis?" I</b>
<br><b>said, "In the log cabin Grandad." He said, "Ohh." then he smiled.
"Did you</b>
<br><b>see her?"&nbsp; I looked at him.&nbsp; "Yes."&nbsp; "That was his
momma. She is my</b>
<br><b>great-great grandmother. Her name was Hilda Sue. I named your Aunt,
Ronnie's</b>
<br><b>sister after her (Ron is my dad). Another person whom i was close
with, was</b>
<br><b>my Aunt Sue (Tragically killed 3 years ago. 2 weeks after she settled
my late</b>
<br><b>grandad's affairs) So i had asked him. If I was imagining it. He
said, no.</b>
<br><b>They're your family, your ancestors. They watch over me. I have
known they</b>
<br><b>were always here. For years and years. Of course the scary thing
was. I could</b>
<br><b>have been Samual's twin sister. Paternal twins i guess. I swear
before God.</b>
<br><b>That he and I, were twins. Dare I say, yes, tomboy yes, but still
very</b>
<br><b>feminine. As was he. In an adrogynous kind of way. Very beautiful
and</b>
<br><b>handsome boy he was. He was killed in action. Don't know where,
when or what</b>
<br><b>year. But, he was in the Civil War. I looked for archives. But,
a lot of</b>
<br><b>stuff, has either been destroyed or buried over the years. In regards
to our</b>
<br><b>family name. And to think, I always had a fascination with the name.
Samual,</b>
<br><b>Samson, Derek, as well as Eric. My grandad said, he may be buried
on the</b>
<br><b>acres. Or in an unmarked grave. Course now, i can't go back to the
farm.</b>
<br><b>Cause, there are present owners there now. Who were family friends.
That take</b>
<br><b>care of grandad's farm. None of whom, or perhaps know anymore than
I do. Or</b>
<br><b>what grandad always told me in secret. Not even my father knows
about our</b>
<br><b>ancestors. All I know, is that my dad, was born, in that log cabin.
Along</b>
<br><b>with my late Aunt Sue. She was the oldest. First child Joana died
of</b>
<br><b>pneumonia 4 years old. My aunt sue, was the only daughter. I never
saw my</b>
<br><b>"mother" of that time anymore.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Second one. I'll make short and brief. Was my uncle Roger. He had
drowned.</b>
<br><b>When my dad was in the Vietnam war. Uncle Roger was 17 when he died.
Dad had</b>
<br><b>to come back for that. Then leave back for Nam. I was in the Shed
this time.</b>
<br><b>And found a bunch of Uncle Roger's things. Including a picture.
This was the</b>
<br><b>same visit by the way. 90 july. Well, i felt a cold chill, once
again. I</b>
<br><b>heard a sobbing. A young man. I looked at the picture. And said
aloud. "Oh</b>
<br><b>that's my uncle Roger."&nbsp; I knew of that name, from what my
dad said. The</b>
<br><b>sobbing stopped. I knew it was him. "Go to the light Uncle Roger."&nbsp;
i felt</b>
<br><b>his hand on my face. He was sobbing. I knew it was him. I just knew
it and i</b>
<br><b>felt it. I wasn't scared at all. I heard his voice, faintly say,
"please</b>
<br><b>don't go near the water. Drown 17."&nbsp; I was like "Yes Uncle
Roger."&nbsp; Then it</b>
<br><b>was gone.</b><b></b>
<p><b>After we left. I took the photo book home. With Samual's pictures
as well as</b>
<br><b>recent ones of Uncle Roger and so forth. I had to start school in
Sep. I</b>
<br><b>turned 17 in Nov 90.&nbsp; Around May 91. Month before I graduated.
Some</b>
<br><b>Neanderthal pushed me in the pool. I nearly drowned myself. I felt
a strong</b>
<br><b>uplift. And I was pushed out of the water. Funny thing was. No other
students</b>
<br><b>were in that pool. Cause everyone had to get in. And a teacher pulled
me up</b>
<br><b>from the water by my hands. I went home. Told my dad what had happened.
He</b>
<br><b>looked at me. And said. "Sis, so many years ago, to this date. Was
when your</b>
<br><b>Uncle Roger had drowned. Same age, as my younger brother." My dad
turned</b>
<br><b>white as a ghost. As had I am certain.</b><b></b>
<p><b>That night. I overheard my dad. He was looking at the photo album.
And he</b>
<br><b>said. "Roger, thank you baby brother. For saving my baby, your niece.
From</b>
<br><b>the very same fate. That cruelly took you away from me. Forever
I am</b>
<br><b>grateful."</b><b></b>
<p><b>I was always deathly afraid of pools, and water, like ponds and rivers.
If I</b>
<br><b>couldn't see the bottom No way in hell. Would I go near it, or even
in it.</b>
<br><b>When I turned 18. I took swimming lessons.</b><b></b>

<br><b><font size=+1>At Mom's House</font></b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: advanced@nidlink.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>I was visiting my family in Moorpark, California around three years</b>
<br><b>ago.&nbsp; I was sleeping in the living room downstairs.&nbsp; The
living room is</b>
<br><b>situated towards the front of the house.&nbsp; To the right of the
front</b>
<br><b>entry there is a staircase and on the top of the staircase there
is an</b>
<br><b>open hall going left and back to the 2 bedrooms and bath.&nbsp;
My twin</b>
<br><b>brothers who were about 12 then shared the second bedroom at the
end of</b>
<br><b>the hall.&nbsp; My Mom and Dad's bedroom was straight at the top
of the</b>
<br><b>stairs.&nbsp; My Mom and I were watching movies until really late.&nbsp;
My Mom</b>
<br><b>was asleep on one end of the couch and I was just ready to fall
alseep</b>
<br><b>on the other end.&nbsp; The 2nd floor is open, the hallway and bedroom
and</b>
<br><b>bath doors are visible from the couch in the living room.&nbsp;
I was laying</b>
<br><b>down, and I heard a running noise, I looked up and saw a boy (who
I</b>
<br><b>thought was one of my twin brothers) dressed in a white hooded zip-up</b>
<br><b>style sweatshirt, run up the stairs from the family room/t.v. area
and</b>
<br><b>down the hall back towards the twins room.&nbsp; The boy was going
so fast</b>
<br><b>wind was making his sweatshirt flare out on the sides.&nbsp; I was
worried</b>
<br><b>and thought something was wrong with one of my brothers (It was
around 3</b>
<br><b>in the morning and they would have no reason to be running around),
even</b>
<br><b>though it was bothering me I saved it until the next day.&nbsp;
I asked my</b>
<br><b>brothers which one of them was running around last night - they
both</b>
<br><b>looked at me like I was crazy and swore it wasn't them.&nbsp; When
I</b>
<br><b>described what the boy was wearing, they both said they didn't have
a</b>
<br><b>white hooded sweatshirt.&nbsp; When my Mom overheard this she confirmed
that,</b>
<br><b>and became very upset.&nbsp; One of the boys friends always came
over to my</b>
<br><b>Mom's house and he ALWAYS wore a white hooded sweatshirt.&nbsp;
He died only</b>
<br><b>a little while before that night.&nbsp; He drowned on the way home
from</b>
<br><b>school in an arroyo near the route home.&nbsp; Since I had been
living in</b>
<br><b>Idaho shorlty after my family moved back to California I had never
met</b>
<br><b>the boy who drowned.</b><b></b>
<p><b>That night scares me sometimes only because it was so real.&nbsp;
It could</b>
<br><b>not have been mistaken for anything else.</b><b></b>

<p><b><font size=+1>Creepy Feeling</font></b><b></b>
<p><b>By: trottier@viptx.net</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I was just reading through your site, and felt that I just had to
write.&nbsp; I no my story doesn't really compare to those that I have
read, but thought you might like to hear it.&nbsp; My family and I were
renting a small house a few years ago and some strange things happened
while we were there.&nbsp; The house was old it was built around world
war I or II whichever one that had the prison camps for Japanese citizens,
anyway the story we got was that this house was the commandants house of
a prison camp. By the way this was in Wyoming so I know at least that there
were prison camps there.The first night I ever stayed in the house I was
by myself, all we had were boxes in the house. Anyway that first night
I was very restless and just had a very strange feeling that I was not
alone. I had told my wife about it later and had made the comment , as
a joke, "maybe we are living in a haunted house" which I would later come
to regret.Now I must add that before this I was never a believer in GHOSTS
or anything like that, but what would happen over the next few months changed
my thinking. The first thing that both my wife and I had witnessed together
happened the first night that we all stayed in the house. We were laying
in bed just dozing off when we heard a loud banging on the wall outside,
which scared the hell out of us. Anyway we lived</b>
<br><b>right by the interstate and really didn't know who could be banging
on our house, so I went outside to check and found nothing, I must add
that there was snow on the ground but no footprints or anything. We just
blew it off.</b>
<br><b>The next thing that happened was one morning while I was on my way
out the door for work I noticed a dining room chair in the middle of our
living room. Since I went to bed before my wife I had just assumed she
was changing a light bulb and had left the chair there. The next thing
I know a couple hours later while I was at work I get a frantic phone call
from my wife wanting to know if I left the chair there.There are other
things like pictures being turned upside down, chairs rocking by themselves,
the dogs barking at the attic, doors slamming and locking, and just that
creepy feeling&nbsp; that you are not alone.</b>

<p><b>Yorktown - Colonial Parkway, Yorktown, VA.&nbsp; 1970.&nbsp; It's
been years. Nothing before or since have we experienced like that foggy
evening on the Parkway.&nbsp; I don't believe in an afterlife.&nbsp; But
the shared experience of a calm, detailed "hysteria" leaves us talking
even today. That 3 people today continue to describe the uniforms, the
hollow sunken faces, the slumped shoulders and the look of complete and
total submission to an eternity of dread, that wrapped around each soldier.
We were lost on the Parkway in that very small town - around the</b>
<br><b>Battlefield. I hadn't had my Driver's License that long: that created
anxiety.&nbsp; The two people with me were concerned about lack of turning
room on the 2-land well maintained road and the fog kept getting heavier
&amp; heavier.&nbsp; The headlights picked up soldier after soldier walking
toward us on either side of the road; not even looking at us but straight
ahead with such exhaustion.&nbsp; I mentioned their unusual gray uniforms.&nbsp;
The uniforms were no!t well kept and that struck me as being unusual.&nbsp;
I've been around the military all my life.&nbsp; These were not current
issue uniforms.&nbsp; It never occurred to us that these men fit the description
of ghosts.&nbsp; Except for their facial expressions.&nbsp; Their complexions
were gray with exhaustion.&nbsp; We all agreed that when I got the car
turned around without getting stuck somehow - maybe we should give these
guys a lift.&nbsp; I found that place to turn around and the headlights
abruptly focused on a man dressed in gray uniform with a yellow sash -
and why</b>
<br><b>I think this must be a shared hysteria - a tri-corner hat.&nbsp;
We all remarked that the uniform must have been a strange mixture of colonial
and civil war staging.&nbsp; But the night was so cold and why would so
many men go to so much trouble for a part of the Parkway that wasn'tbeing
travelled that night.&nbsp; The three of us have tried to figure out who
started the conversation of ghosts - we didn't discuss ghosts then because
none of us believed in!</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;them.&nbsp; But somehow, we were able to share a feeling that
we, or one of us, transferred into a very large, very real shared mirage
of dynamic proportion.&nbsp; And that's what haunts us today.&nbsp; What
in the human mind could project such images to other people.&nbsp; How
could we have seen, simultanously, in such detail these solders who looked
so "dead".&nbsp; Maybe that was the key word for our "hysteria". We tested
each other.&nbsp; "What did the soldier in the turnaround look like?"&nbsp;
I knew.&nbsp; I only had to hear it from the other two.&nbsp; And so, if
this was</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;a prank, congratulations guys.&nbsp; You've held our interest
for years.&nbsp; But was it really worth the expense and makeup for one
lost car on an empty, 2-lane, foggy parkway</b><b></b>

<br><b><font size=+1>Old Hospital in Hangtown</font></b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: Blondecali@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>Back in about 1982,&nbsp; I became resident manager of an old rooming
house in</b>
<br><b>Placerville,&nbsp; California (better known as Hangtown).&nbsp;
Placerville is just a</b>
<br><b>few miles from Coloma where the Gold Rush took place at Sutter's
Fort on the</b>
<br><b>American River.</b>
<br><b>The rooming house,&nbsp; during the Gold Rush era,&nbsp; was the
only hospital in the</b>
<br><b>area.&nbsp; it consisted of 42 rentable rooms and several miscellaneous
rooms that</b>
<br><b>were used by residents for laundry,&nbsp; storage,&nbsp; vending
machines,&nbsp; a t.v.</b>
<br><b>room,&nbsp; community kitchen, diningroom and my office.&nbsp; I
had been manager for</b>
<br><b>about 6 months before the chaos started.&nbsp; I have always been
sensitive,</b>
<br><b>having had several experiences all through childhood and adulthood.</b>
<br><b>One cold,&nbsp; Winter night,&nbsp; a bad storm had moved in and
the main Highway to</b>
<br><b>South Lake Tahoe had to close, trapping several skiers and gamblers
halfway</b>
<br><b>up the hills.&nbsp; It didn't take long before the motels and hotels
filled up.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>got a call from the Police Department asking me if I could accomodate
the</b>
<br><b>stranded travelers.&nbsp; I let them know that I had about 10 or
12 vacancies,</b>
<br><b>but to let them know that our power had failed due to the storm.&nbsp;
All street</b>
<br><b>lights were out and there was total blackness everywhere.&nbsp;
There were several</b>
<br><b>steps leading up to the entry door and I was afraid that in the
darkness,</b>
<br><b>someone might get hurt.&nbsp; All of the tenants helped out.&nbsp;
We gathered up</b>
<br><b>candles and put them out on the steps.&nbsp; We dug up some old
coffee percolaters</b>
<br><b>and made coffee the old way and set out to greet our guests.</b>
<br><b>They didn't come in one at a time.&nbsp; They came in about 10 at
a time.&nbsp; I paid</b>
<br><b>some volunteer residents to get rooms ready while I checked the
people in.</b>
<br><b>There was a group of the younger residents there at the stairs with</b>
<br><b>flashlights ready to take the new guests up the long flight of stairs
to the</b>
<br><b>upper rooms.&nbsp; As the guests would arrive,&nbsp; these men would
chant,&nbsp; "welcome</b>
<br><b>to the Hotel California.&nbsp; You can check out any time you like,&nbsp;
but you can</b>
<br><b>never leave".</b>
<br><b>All went well, and the next morning everyone thanked and said that
they had a</b>
<br><b>wonderful stay and really enjoyed the off-the-wall hospitality.</b>
<br><b>Shortly thereafter we had a tenants meeting.&nbsp; During the meeting,&nbsp;
these men</b>
<br><b>were chanting the words to the song,&nbsp; "Hotel California"&nbsp;
and called my</b>
<br><b>attention to several verses.&nbsp; During the storm,&nbsp; I had
lit the candles to</b>
<br><b>show the guests the way.</b>
<br><b>At one time,&nbsp; the community kitchen had been the manager's
residence kitchen.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;In the day of the hospital it had been the emergency room.&nbsp;
In the masters</b>
<br><b>chambers they gather for the fiest.&nbsp; Other verses fit also.</b>
<br><b>Everytime the song would come on a radio anywhere in the roominghouse,&nbsp;
the</b>
<br><b>volume would be cranked.&nbsp; Then one night as I sat figuring
up the next day's</b>
<br><b>bank deposit,&nbsp; I heard screaming.&nbsp; It was the young girl
down the hall on the</b>
<br><b>first floor who was living there with her small Son.&nbsp; She told
me that there</b>
<br><b>was the face of a man on her wall.&nbsp; My Husband went and checked
it out and</b>
<br><b>yes,&nbsp; it was there.&nbsp; Later that night about 2 a.m.&nbsp;
she came to my office</b>
<br><b>again and said that she kept hearing a whistle (like a bamboo whistle)&nbsp;
and a</b>
<br><b>child's voice calling "Mommy"&nbsp; outside her room.&nbsp; I went
down there and heard</b>
<br><b>the same thing.&nbsp; One of the young men who was still up watching
t.v.,&nbsp; went</b>
<br><b>outside to check it out.&nbsp; He said the sound was coming from
every direction</b>
<br><b>he walked.&nbsp; He would hear it from the South,&nbsp; North, East
and West as he</b>
<br><b>walked.</b>
<br><b>By now,&nbsp; the commotion had woke just about everyone in the
rooming house.</b>
<br><b>The t.v. room filled up with people telling me of the experiences
that they</b>
<br><b>had been having but were too afraid to talk about until this night.&nbsp;
About 4</b>
<br><b>a.m.&nbsp; everyone went back to bed.&nbsp; I stayed up along with
two of the younger,</b>
<br><b>more brave men.&nbsp; As we sat in the t.v. room talking,&nbsp;
we heard loud stomping</b>
<br><b>coming from somewhere in the back part of the lower story.&nbsp;
At the end of the</b>
<br><b>main entry hall,&nbsp; there was a swinging door that led to the
laundry area.</b>
<br><b>Beyond that,&nbsp; the garbage room,&nbsp; beyond the garbage room
there were other</b>
<br><b>empty rooms that I was told later,&nbsp; was the hospital morgue.</b>
<br><b>As we passed the community kitchen and started to approach the swinging
door,</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;the footsteps got louder.&nbsp; We all looked through the
window at the top of</b>
<br><b>the swinging door and saw no one.&nbsp; Just then,&nbsp; the door
swung open and stayed</b>
<br><b>open as though someone were holding it.&nbsp; Needless to say,&nbsp;
me and these brave</b>
<br><b>men backed up quickly.&nbsp; No one was standing there at the door,&nbsp;
but it</b>
<br><b>remained open for several seconds and then swung shut.&nbsp; It
was a quiet, still</b>
<br><b>night so the theory of a breeze or wind is out.&nbsp; In a few minutes,&nbsp;
the</b>
<br><b>footsteps started again,&nbsp; just as loud as the first time.&nbsp;
We looked down the</b>
<br><b>hall and the swinging door was opening and shutting continuously
and with a</b>
<br><b>lot of force.&nbsp; We were all speechless.&nbsp; All the time this
was happening,&nbsp; we</b>
<br><b>were still hearing the whistle and the child's voice calling "Mommy".</b>
<br><b>In the nights to follow,&nbsp; there were several incidents and
some residents</b>
<br><b>that had been there for years,&nbsp; moved out.&nbsp; Within a matter
of a few months,</b>
<br><b>I was gone.</b>
<br><b>I have never gone back there,&nbsp; but I wonder to this day,&nbsp;
if there are still</b>
<br><b>occurances at that place.&nbsp; Every time I hear that song,&nbsp;
it brings that place</b>
<br><b>to mind and when it does,&nbsp; I get a cold chill and every detail
is just as</b>
<br><b>visible in my mind as it was that very night.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Though I am only 12 years old,I have had more encounters with spirits
and ghosts than most people do in a life time.Hauntings run in my family.My
father was born in Ireland,in a haunted castle.My mother's home as a child
was made over a cemetery used only for murderers.I,however,live in a home
made over an anthill.If I were to tell you my life story,it would take
pages and pages.So I will tell you only parts.The first encounter I can
remember(I've had them since I was born)was when I was 4 years old.I was
up in my grandmothers attic,when I felt extremely cold.When I looked up,there
was a woman in a wedding gown standing in front of me.I was young,so I
asked her what her name was and why she was in my grandma's attic.She looked
at me in a stare I will never forget,then dissapeared.I found out later
who she was.This is her story:Ann Ashman was born in 1773 in Castlebar,Ireland.She
met a man named Mark O'Connely,and soon after became engaged to him.On
the</b>
<br><b>night before their wedding,Mark became possessed by a demon or spirit.To
this day,no one knows what it is.Mark,while possessed,took an ax,took Ann
into the middle of the woods,and brutally chopped off all her body parts,till
it didn't even look like a human.He then chopped off his on head.Police
went looking for them the next morning when neither had come home or gone
to their wedding.They found Ann and Mark in the</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;woods.My great grandma told me this story not too long a go,because
she never explained it when it happened.She says that Ann haunts many peoples
attics,looking for Mark.My gg says Ann wants to forgive him.They say Mark
does the same.So be on the look out,and know that if you ever see a red
head with a wedding dress on,or a headless man in a tux,you know it's them.</b><b></b>

<br><b><font size=+1>A Haunted House</font></b><b></b>
<p><b>By: HoneyRose6329372@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>My best friend Kay just moved out of a house that is most definitely
haunted.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;This house is in Dayton Idaho, a small town of about 200 people
about 10</b>
<br><b>miles north of the Utah Idaho border. Its sits on Dayton's main
street across</b>
<br><b>from the city park. Its a large old house that has been divided
into a two</b>
<br><b>family dwelling.&nbsp; My friend lived in the front part of the
house while</b>
<br><b>another family lived in the back. Kay told me that she and her three
kids</b>
<br><b>never liked the house from the beginning, but she had taken a new
job in</b>
<br><b>Preston and needed to find a house to live in. After spending days
looking</b>
<br><b>for a place to live she was told about this house and went out to
look at it.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;She said when she saw the house it looked dark even though
the sun was</b>
<br><b>shining. When she went inside she said the house was even darker
inside and</b>
<br><b>there was a heavy feeling in the house she just couldn't shake.
She really</b>
<br><b>didn't like the house but it was all that she could find so she
took it.</b>
<br><b>>From the beginning she and kids disliked living there. Her fourteen
year old</b>
<br><b>daughter hated staying by herself in the house and would do anything
to avoid</b>
<br><b>being alone. She said that she always felt like someone was watching
her. One</b>
<br><b>afternoon when she was alone she saw the dark shadow of man looking
through</b>
<br><b>the hall window at her. This really scared her.&nbsp; The Hall window
is high off</b>
<br><b>the ground and you would need a ladder to see in the window. When
you pass</b>
<br><b>the hall window, the hall turns and goes past the stairs and ends
in the</b>
<br><b>master bedroom. This part of the hall at the base of the stairs
is always</b>
<br><b>frigid. My friend had found a new home to rent and was eager to
get out of</b>
<br><b>this house. I was helping her pack and I had mentioned to her how
cold that</b>
<br><b>hallway was by&nbsp; the stairs.&nbsp; It was like walking into
a freezer. She said</b>
<br><b>that it was always like that. Even in the summer when it was 90
degrees</b>
<br><b>outside, she said that hall was freezing cold. I thought&nbsp; at
first it was</b>
<br><b>cold because the storm windows had been left open. So I closed them.
Then it</b>
<br><b>dawned on me that it wasn't that cold outside because we have been
having</b>
<br><b>such a mild winter. It also felt like a cold wind was blowing across
the hall</b>
<br><b>even though there were no drafts anywhere.&nbsp; The cold spot never
moved. As</b>
<br><b>soon as you went into the bedroom or upstairs or into the bathroom
or kitchen</b>
<br><b>it was warm but as soon as you stepped into that hall you froze.
Her eight</b>
<br><b>year twin boys would never go to bed alone.&nbsp; Kay told me that
they were</b>
<br><b>scared to sleep without each other being there. Mac told me that
he and his</b>
<br><b>brother Jed never went to bed alone.&nbsp; That it was too scary
up there.&nbsp; Until</b>
<br><b>they moved into this house they had never been afraid to sleep alone.
Kay and</b>
<br><b>her kids finally got moved into their new house. The Other family
that lived</b>
<br><b>in the back moved out two days before Kay did.&nbsp; Renters never
stay long in</b>
<br><b>that house. Their new house is bright and cheerful, a stark contrast
to the</b>
<br><b>old house.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have experienced alot of these kinds of
things all my life..</b>
<br><b>but this was the first time I had ever experienced psychic cold
or cold</b>
<br><b>spots.&nbsp; I get cold just thinking about it!!</b>
