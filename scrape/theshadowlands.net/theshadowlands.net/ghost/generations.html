<font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><b>While most families have
one or two supernatural experiences happen to their family in a
lifetime, some families are prone down thru generations to witness
experience after experience.&nbsp; This is not common but it does
happen.&nbsp; There are stories on the Shadowlands that state my mother
could see spirits or my grandparents lived in a haunted home. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Is this because we live in the same houses as previous family members
so we are seeing the same spirits as seen before by the passed
generations? Or is it because there is something in our genetic make-up
that attracts spirit energy to us.&nbsp; Both theories are probably
true.&nbsp; A haunted house is a haunted house and unless something and
unless something changes and the spirit crosses over, then the property
will remain haunted.&nbsp; The spirit may become dormant or get the
notion to move on by themselves.&nbsp; If the haunting is residual than
it might not ever change but continue to play out the same scene over
and over again down through many different owners. &nbsp;<br>
If a spirit is attached to the house or property in a different way a
haunting could change just by the emotional change in a home.&nbsp; One
example of this could be&#8230;<br>
<br>
The 1st generation owns the house, they sense cold spots, and feel like
something is watching them.&nbsp; It is not a bad feeling. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
2nd generation inherits the home and decides to remodel the
kitchen.&nbsp; The haunting then changes, items start disappearing and
noises are heard throughout the house. The feeling of being watched
intensifies with the added emotion of disapproval. <br>
<br>
3rd Generation inherits the house.&nbsp; These new house owners are
unorganized and very untidy.&nbsp; The haunting gets worse.&nbsp; Bad
odors are smelled throughout the home. Doors open and close, lights go
off and on and apparitions are felt and seen.&nbsp; Uneasiness is felt
throughout the house. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
4th generation moves into the house.&nbsp; They restore it to its
original condition; they love the house and put their love into keeping
the home happy and clean.&nbsp; The spirit settles down to just the
cold spots and watching over the family.&nbsp; This would be a haunting
of a house or property where the spirit was very attached to the home
and wanted things to stay the same with no compromise. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Another scenario<br>
<br>
1st Generation- a loved ones dies with the promise that they will
always look after the family.&nbsp; After the funeral, family notices
feelings of being watched and protected.<br>
<br>
2nd generation- Woken by some unknown noise that disturbs the whole
house.&nbsp; After looking for the source of the noise it is discovered
there is a gas leak or some other danger present that might have been
dangerous had the family not been woken in the night.<br>
<br>
3rd generation awakened by knocks on the wall only to discover an
intruder in the home. And so on down through the generations.&nbsp;
This would be a family being haunted by a loved one who has promised to
look after their families.&nbsp; This has also been called a guardian
or protector spirit. &nbsp;<br>
Here is another situation&#8230; <br>
<br>
1st generation sees entities hears them and lives in numerous locations
throughout their entire lives with spirit so frequent they become
commonplace.&nbsp; Never or rarely the same entity twice to their
knowledge.&nbsp; 2nd generation being taught from a very early age that
spirits do exist and if treated with respect, are nothing to be fearful
of.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
<br>
This sensitivity to the spirit world seems to be passed on down family
member, after family member.&nbsp; This family seems to have something
about them that allows them to experience the afterlife generation
after generation.&nbsp; Maybe it is because of their open mindedness to
the supernatural, or maybe it is hereditary.&nbsp; Then again maybe it
is the spirits that sense something about certain families that they
don&#8217;t even know about themselves.&nbsp; Until more is known about the
spirit world all we can do is speculate why some families just seem to
be haunted. &nbsp;<br>
