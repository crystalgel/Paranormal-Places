Ghost Story<br>
<br>
By: blackironrose1001@yahoo.com <br>
<br>
I have read many of the stories on this site, believe that they are
entirely real, and finally feel comfortable sharing my own. My name is
Kay, and I have had some very striking experiences. I have found that I
am clairvoyant, and when I was eleven years old I had my first
premonition. It was a bit ironic, because it was a premonition that I
would start seeing spirits and, well...having more premonitions. One
thing that confuses me is that, even though I had never really "seen"
things per se, I knew when I woke up that morning that I was
"different", and was not concerned by it at all. I was raised
Christian, and my parents only told me about demons and angels. My
mother frowned upon me having any sort of dealings with the paranormal,
as the thought that it wasn't "safe". My father, however, has had many
experiences; he's had spirits walking behind him, step for step, seen
prescences shove his mother out the door and into the yard, felt
entities grab him, etc. Therefore, I felt a little more comfortable
telling him, as I progressed through my twelfth year, that I was having
more dreams of things that would occur a week or so later. All he
really said was that God was probably going to use me for something
later in life. While I found my premonitions and deja-vu's of deja-vu's
of deja-vu's interesting, I didn't really put much thought or energy
into them. <br>
Later, during the summer of my thirteenth year, something...changed
somehow. Not only did I continue to have prophetic dreams (which were
truly terrifying when interspersed with nightmares, as I didn't know
how to distinguish the two from one another), I started seeing,
hearing, sensing, and being touched by very unnatural entities. None of
these things helped with my teenage insecurities and consequent
faltering mental stability. Hearing evil, mocking laughter wake you up
in the middle of the night when you already dislike yourself and
suspect that you're losing your mind is NOT comforting in the least. At
thirteen, and then fourteen years of age, I was very emotional and felt
estranged from my parents and everyone else, save my friend Jeff. My
terrifying experiences with the paranormal finally drove me to a
deathwish.<br>
It is a little difficult to share this, but I do so with the hope of
being an encouragement to others... After many, many attempts to end my
own life in ways that did not work (due, yet again, to supernatural
forces), I went out and hanged myself. As I was losing consciousness
and slipping away, I became aware of a presence enveloping me. It was a
great, dark shadow, exceptionally beautiful on some deep, subconscious
level- I say dark, but it was not in any way evil. I felt this cool,
stale, smoky shadow of a prescence wrapping itself around me- like an
embrace, only more enveloping. I knew in that moment (without knowing
how I knew) that I was lingering on the edge, about to die, and that my
visitor was the Angel of Death (referred to in the Bible as such, and
also as the Holy Spirit or Holy Ghost). I panicked, was miraculously
able to undo the rope, and passed out on the ground. What struck me the
most vividly was the emotion of the entity- he was unbelieveably sad.
It was as if he was holding me gently, enfolding me against his body,
and telling me "Please, don't do this...it isn't right. It isn't your
time." I remember that my friend Jeff was very shaken by the story, and
that that was the beginning of the end of the most awful period of my
life. I found out that Jeff also had had very vivid, striking
experiences with the supernatural, and we began to share with one
another and embrace our abilities. My experiences also begain to become
more vivid from then on. <br>
Long since the rougher parts of my life, I have grown to love life, the
spirit realm, and my old friend; Jeff and I are now happily engaged. I
have discovered, over time, that he is considerably more clairvoyant
than I; therefore he sees and experiences more. One of his more recent
experiences was very intriguing, and happened while he was on the phone
with me late at night. He was sitting in his father's mechanic shop,
which is a few hundred feet from his house. On the desk he was sitting
at were an old telephone and a desktop computer, both unplugged. I
heard him inhale sharply and then become very quiet. I asked him what
was the matter, and he informed me that the unplugged phone had beeped
and started making static noises, and that the "on" light on the
unplugged computor monitor was blinking. He felt the presence very
clearly, and told me that it was female. Then, he realized that the
blinking computer light was morse code. The ghost, through blinking
morse code, told him her name (her last name he recognized as belonging
to a family that lived down the road), and asked him where she could
find his uncle. He tapped morse code on the desk to tell her where to
go, and she touched his hand and left. Jeff has also had seemingly
random experiences where entities will enter his bedroom and touch him
on the hand or shoulder, or linger outside his window and make music
come from nowhere. <br>
My own most vivid experience, besides my encounter with the Angel of
Death, has occurred recently in my own room. One night I was awakened
by a sharp cracking noise. The thought "poltergeist" entered my mind,
however, I have become quite comfortable with most prescences and
figured that I would go back to sleep and check on it in the morning.
When I looked around that morning, I found that a framed drawing of
mine was lying undamaged on the floor about eight feet from where it
would have fallen. I expecially noticed its location because I had not
heard it roll or bounce- it was one, sharp crack. I was slightly
concerned, since its place on the shelf was nowhere near a vent or
anything that could have knocked it down. However, I merely placed it
back on the shelf and passed through a couple of nights with no further
occurrences. However, two or three nights later I heard the same crack
of my picture hitting the floor. I ignored it and went back to sleep. <br>
This evidently irked the entity, because at around six that morning I
was awakened by very loud thumping, knocking, and glass clinking. On my
dresser, I have a painting leaning against the wall at the back, and
lots of candles, glass vessels, little boxes, and curios. Immediately
after I woke to the sound of all my things being moved around, I saw
the painting fly up in the air, flip over, and land on a pile of
laundry on the floor. I let out a surprised yell and began fimly
commanding the prescence to leave my room in the name of God if it was
malicious. The movement stopped, and I turned on the light- however, I
was aware that it hadn't completely "gone away". About two thirds of
all the things on my dresser were scattered on the floor, my top
dresser drawer was open, and I was very irritated. The main cause of my
irritation was that I had had a very delicate wax-adorned bottle on my
dresser that was a gift from my fiancee. I was worried that it had been
damaged, and I couldn't see it either on my dresser or on the floor. I
got out of bed to look for it and found that it, along with my most
fragile candle holder, had been neatly placed, undamaged and out of
harm's way, in a box that I have at the base of my dresser. <br>
When I realized that the entity had some courtesy, I felt bad for
lashing out at it and apologized. I then prayed and asked the Lord to
execute His will- if the prescence was evil, cast it out, and if not,
let it stay. I made sure to leave everything just as it was, so that
later I could make sure that I had not been dreaming. Surely enough,
later in the morning when I woke up again, everything was just as it
had been- strewn over the floor. As I was picking my things up, I
noticed that I could not find one of my white taper-candles. I looked
all over, and finally found it hidden underneath a bag of sewing
supplies on the other side of my dresser. That evening as I was leaving
my room my door, which always swings open unless I latch it, stayed
closed behind me even though it was unlatched. I took note of this, and
also of the fact that when I returned and pushed the door open, there
was slight pressure against the door at first, which had never been
there before. I was overjoyed that the entity had stayed. Over time, I
have gotten the impression that it is a small child, and have named it
Angel. <br>
A few nights ago, I think that I may have seen him/her. (I am confused
as to the gender because, for whatever reason, I cannot feel this
presence like I can feel others- it is extremely subtle and nearly
impossible to sense until it makes a physical manifestation). I had
been making something in the kitchen area that night, and had gone to
my room to get something. What I saw was so fleeting that I would have
dismissed it as my imagination- except I had not even been thinking
about Angel (or anything involving ghosts or the paranormal, for that
matter), and therefore wouldn't have fabricated the sighting in my own
mind. I look at the ground when I walk, so as I got to the door of my
room I saw the legs of a little child, probably between five and seven
years of age. The image was so fleeting that I did not have time to
look up and see the top half of the child. However, what I did see were
old-fashioned white stockings that reached up to the knees; and
unfortunately (Angel seems intent on remaining unspecified in terms of
gender), I did not have time to tell if the legs were clothed with
knickers or a knee-length skirt. I want to say that they were knickers,
(I keep getting the faint impression that Angel is more like a boy than
a girl), but I cannot be sure. Whatever Angel is, he is certainly not
malicious in the least. I am always comforted, knowing that I have
company, and also feel a fondness for the spirit. I am very maternal
and nurturing by nature, and I find this spirit-child's playful habits
to be very endearing. He will sometimes move my things around, as if
trying to see whether or not I will notice or be able to figure out
what he moved. He also makes tiny scratching noises on the wall above
my headboard at times, while I am reading or on the phone. I now think
of him very much like a little brother, nephew, or son. <br>
The general area around my home seems to be haunted by strange
prescences as well. I have had visions of spirit-wolf creatures in
areas down the road. After investigation and psychic communication with
them, I found unusual canine tracks in my dirt driveway that led to the
spot where I had psychically reached out to them. There were also more
canine tracks that appeared out of nowhere, led up to my gate, and then
went down the road that leads to the places that I had had visions of.
The tracks led to the middle of the road and then disappeared. I have
also heard these creatures wailing, howling, shrieking, and moaning-
they have upset several neighbours' dogs and cattle very much. These
sounds, as well as the visions of the wolves, are always the strongest
and clearest at the full moon. I wonder if they are connected to Native
American culture- I know that people of that culture always used to
believe in and encounter spirit-animals. The strange thing is that I
live in Florida, and we do not have any wolves in the area. They are
fairly friendly, with very intelligent faces. They are all grey, and
have black (or extremely dark brown) eyes. I got the distinct feeling
that they saw me, too, and I have felt them nearby, watching me;
however, I do not physically see them. It is as if they are on a
different dimension or similar such thing. The only physical evidence
that I have of them are their tracks, as well as their wailings. I have
also heard one of them growl at me from about ten to twenty feet in the
woods (and believe me when I say that I checked and confirmed that
nothing tangible should have made that sound. There was no animal
there, and no sort of machinery that could have made a sound like a
growl). By all means, let me know if you have any thoughts on what they
could be.<br>

Ghostly Experience<br>
<br>
<br>
By: tigeress848@bigpond.com<br>

<br>
Hi I have afew ghost experience I would like to tell you and hopefully
get some answers from them too.<br>
By the way, great website, I've been fascinated by the spirit world for
a while but I don't believe in trying to contact any spirits and I will
never try so I don't know why this happened to me but here is my
experience.<br>
I was in the house I grew up in, I lived there with the family years
ago with (mum, younger brother and sister) for about 15 years, now have
moved out and they had some other people in there renting the house
then they moved out and I moved in with my boyfriend, and afew times in
the night when me and my boyfriend was in bed I would hear footsteps on
the carpet walking down the passage, and into the bedroom <br>
Also while my Boyfriend was at work, one night I was home by myself
around 11:00pm I got up and went into the kitchen to make myself a
coffee, and I was in the process of making it when I could feel a
tingling behind me I kept putting my hand up behind my head thinking
nothing of it, it kept doing it and again and again I would put my hand
up to feel the spot where it felt strange, then, I looked up on the
wall for some reason, and there on the wall was the shadow of a hand
with slightly pointed fingers the shadow was so solid and so dark
against the brightly lit wall I knew it wasn't my shadow I spun around
to see if anything was behind me, nothing, I looked back at the wall
and the hand was gone, by this time I had my back to the wall I was so
scared a wave of shock or something came over me I went all hot in the
face and was shaking realizing that it wasn't me but something else
really scared me, so I left and went to my mothers as soon as I got
there I cried.<br>
Now I have moved out of the place and am renting somewhere else, I
don't feel afraid but more curious about it now can you give me some
answers? Whether it was evil or not or maybe trying to tell me
something? But what?<br>
Anyway hope to hear back from you.<br>

Hello, my name is kiely. I wanted to add an experience i had for your
post of the maple valley highway in renton. When i was younger i
remember having dreams of places i have never been. I drempt of a place
with a long road. this road elevated at each end of me so i only saw
the small stretch of road i was standing. this road went through dense
woods, and in the distance i could see mountian like hills. I, for some
reason, was always in a vehicle of some kind. I was too young to drive
when i first got these dreams so i know i was not driving but the car
was moving. As i pulled up to and opening on the right, there was a
misty building off to the right hand side of the road. At this point in
my dream the car i was in would come to a stop. This is when i got out.
Now something bad and dark was always coming for me causing me to run.
Most of the time i would run to this circular, tube like piece of
machinery. The bad thing would turn this on, it would rotate and i
would wake up. Sometimes i would run inside the building. It was really
dark, even though i knew it was dark outside, the inside of the
building always seemed too dark. I would wait in a corner in this
verson of the dream and then i would wake feeling as though i was there
all night and not in my dream. Now this is where it gets freaky. Many
years later when i was a softmore in highschool, we moved to the renton
highlands. I drove from here to my school in covington. Usually i took
the freeways, but then my aunt showed me a highway. Then next monday i
woke at 4am and my brother and i took this new highway. I freaked out
when i passed this streatch of road where i saw this mill that produced
some kind of saw dust. This was the place i dremt about so many times.
I drove by that place for three years. not even now will i stop at that
area. it creaps me out. i never saw a women on the side of the road but
i have experienced the old house with the lights turning on and off.
almost in morse code. but mostly i have had double takes where i swear
i see something, but on second look there is nothing there. <br>
thankyou for listening and if you are curious feel free to e-mail me.<br>

Kindred Spirits - a ghost story<br>
<br>
By: lucy@hivesystems.net <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Shortly after moving from London to a 17th century farmhouse in a rural
South Norfolk village, we were visited by a psychic friend. Mike has
communicated with those on "the other side" since he was a child; he
doesn't go looking for them, but it seems they seek him out with
messages for those they've left behind. He sometimes feels he has to go
and ask a stranger in a pub whether they know who "X" is, and whether
some information about "Y"<br>
means anything to them. Inevitably it does and, even if initially
sceptical, people are always amazed and grateful in the end, for the
communication.<br>
I've always been fascinated by ghosts and the supernatural, but nothing
like this had ever happened for me. This hot summer evening, though
after a sudden storm had lit up the fields behind us with wild forks of
lightening and crashes of thunder, Mike gave a slight shudder and said,
"Lucy, there's someone here and he wants to talk to you. "<br>
Over the next forty minutes, Mike relayed what he was hearing from a
man who claimed he had lived in our village, had been accused of a
crime he hadn't committed and had to leave under a cloud around the
year 1945. He was pleased and&nbsp; "tickled" that I had come to live
in this house - which was not a place he had ever lived, though he had
possibly worked here - because he knew I was a writer and researcher.
He wanted me to tell his story and "right the wrong"; clear his name of
the false accusation.<br>
In fact he gave his name quite clearly, and the nickname he was often
known by, and told Mike (though some of the information came in
pictures and feelings as well as words)&nbsp; where he could be found
in the churchyard. But he was much less clear about the incident that
had caused him the trouble.<br>
In response to my questions, Mike was told there were still people
around who would remember him, that people from the church were
involved, there was a definite World War Two feel to his story, but not
much other useful detail.<br>
However, this man had wise words for someone who had moved to the
country with the hope of becoming a fiction writer. He told me I should
move my study from the attic down to a room with a wide bay window
overlooking fields and the church, because this would be my "window on
the world" at which I should write. He told me his story was a gift to
me.<br>
I wasn't too sure what to make of all this - at the time I only had
three abandoned chapters of a London-based novel in a drawer somewhere
and an idea about writing a factual book on moving to the country. The
next day, though, I took the dog for a walk past the village church and
decided to take a look in the graveyard. To my amazement, there was a
small plaque, exactly where he had described it, with the name of my
ghost and dates that showed he would have been a youngish man in the
Second World War.<br>
Despite this somewhat shocking confirmation, finding out any more about
him wasn't straightforward. I couldn't find any older residents of the
village who remembered him, but I eventually found a record of his
daughter attending the village school (where my children go) during the
early 1940s, their address and date of departure in 1946 because they
were "moving to London". I tried to find the daughter, but with no
result. Eventually, having forgotten that he said people connected to
the church would help, I put my ghost story and a request for
information in our parish newsletter - and within a week his son (who
lives abroad and was on a very rare visit<br>
home) and nephew had both rung me, and prompted by her brother, his
daughter wrote to me.<br>
They had all been children in the 1940s, and not aware of any crime or
indiscretion that their father or uncle had committed. But from their
different accounts I pieced together that my man had been a frequent
visitor to the village before the war, staying with his uncle and aunt
at their farm. During these visits he had met the daughter of one of
the village's most prosperous families (they owned a shop, the mill and
much surrounding farmland), they had fallen in love and eventually
married. She already had a son and then they had a daughter themselves.
When he was called up to fight, she and the children went to live with
her mother and helped run the shop.<br>
He moved in with them when the war ended.<br>
His son and daughter remembered my ghost as a great father, loving and
committed husband, but a "failed businessman" - someone who always had
lots of ideas for making money but never managed to bring any to
fruition. His death certificate (which I sent up for), describes his
occupation as a driving instructor - perhaps the last resort of a
failed businessman. They couldn't think of anything he might have been
accused of, though told me that a milestone in their lives was when
their grandfather (his<br>
father-in-law) had unexpectedly died in 1944, leaving no will. A family
row meant they had had to leave their house and go to live in London.
This had been very upsetting to the two children who had been happy at
their schools and their country environment.<br>
The nephew recalled his uncle in slightly different terms: "a wheeler
dealer" and "a spiv"; someone who liked the ladies was how he described
him.<br>
He remembered that when his grandfather had died - intestate - the
estate had been much smaller than expected, money and goods apparently
missing. His own father had been a strange, reclusive man who been in
the RAF, lived apart from his wife and child and didn't think much of
his sister's choice of husband.<br>
That was it - the information trail stopped there. The son and
daughter, polite though they had been to someone claiming to have been
called on by their father's spirit, suggested I should leave well
alone. Mike received no return visit from our man and doesn't "call up"
his visitors.<br>
In a last ditch attempt to find out the facts, I went to a friend who
is also a professional psychic and asked her if she could contact my
man. I gave her his name and the wartime date, but she wanted no more
information.<br>
At first there was no response to her efforts to tap into the spirit
world, but then a charming gentleman in a demob suit and trilby
appeared to her - "I want to call him a spiv," she said - but he said
nothing. As she was about to give up, another man "came through". This
gentleman was in RAF uniform, a very upright, establishment figure who
had taken part in WW2.<br>
The session was taped and this is what she said, verbatim:<br>
"This gentleman has some regrets. This gentleman. there is a lot of
emotion with this gentleman. He said he upset some people. He said it
was never his intention to upset. He was, in his words, he was "rather
a selfish person".<br>
He said also he realises now he was harsher than he should have been.
He realises now that he was difficult. He thinks that people might have
misunderstood him sometimes. He was blunt. He said what he thought, and
often without thinking about others around. But he was very stubborn
and although he knew he had said things wrong, he would not give in.
That was not good. He would like to apologise but it is so late. I feel
this person has... that he did mellow somewhat in his later years, but
it was like he was two people. He says he is sorry, he would like all
that to be gone, but he knows it's not, because he never realised there
would be repercussions and there were so many repercussions."<br>
Sometime during this quite long drawn out set of events, my first novel
was published. "Blood and Water" was set in London's Crystal Palace
district; the present day heroine had a psychic gift that took the
reader back into the history of the place and the palace. As soon as
that book was finished I knew where my second plot would come from. <br>
"Kindred Spirits" combines my experience of moving to the country with
that of a Land Girl who comes to the same farmhouse in 1939. She works
for the Jackson family, whose eldest daughter, Emma, falls for a
charming wheeler dealer who visits the village called Henry Tinker.
Both Londoners find kindred spirits in their new rural environments -
and spirits of the supernatural kind. As it says on the back cover: <br>
"Mo Mozart, with her GP husband Jack and two young children, moves from
Crystal Palace to rural Norfolk in pursuit of the perfectly balanced
lifestyle. Their idyllic farmhouse, though, holds dark family secrets
that date back decades - to when Dottie Hammond moved from London to
become a World War Two Land Girl on a farm surrounded by Norfolk's
RAF/USA Airbases. <br>
Mo's happy country life starts to unravel when Jack is accused of
abusing a young patient, she starts having flashbacks to the 1940s and
her daughter, Lily, develops an imaginary friend from the same era.
With help from both town and country friends, experiences of past and
present, Dottie's wartime diary and a community production of "Hamlet",
Mo uncovers the unresolved events that have haunted the village of
Great Haddeston for seventy years.<br>
In the process she sorts out her own complex family issues that revolve
around Jack's adoption and his glamorous birth mother."<br>
I can only hope that, while the story of "Kindred Spirits" is entirely
a work of fiction based around some historical events, the character of
Henry Tinker captures some of my ghost's spirit - his personality and
charm, and that the unravelling of the plot I have woven around him
goes some way to vindicating him from what he may have been accused of
all those years ago.<br>

Smoke in the Kitchen<br>
<br>
By: alericson@worldnet.att.net<br>
<br>
I wonder if anyone else has had a similar experience. Particularly with
a smoke like ghost. No features of a figure or face. Just a small
column of smoke with a curl like a cigarette smoke would curl.<br>
When I saw it at 8:30 am nearly a foot away from my stove I figured I
had a fire. So I had to quickly pass through the smoke to get to the
stove and found no burners on and no sensation of heat. No people were
in the house. When I turned back to see the smoke it had gone, all
within 15 seconds. There was no smell but possibly a coolness to the
smoke. It is quite unexplainable to me.<br>
My twin had died 10 months to the day, prior to the happening with the
smoke. But what is also very strange is that her daughter delivered her
first baby girl that same day. I feel that my twin could have
reincarnated into her granddaughter and on the way to planet Earth she
stopped by to say Hi to me. <br>
I'm sure this sounds pretty weird to most people but my twin and I were
raised with metaphysical beliefs so I was just curious if there were
other similar examples.<br>
Thank you for listening.<br>

Ellensburg, Washington<br>
<br>
By: sodomojogrl@yahoo.com<br>
&nbsp;<br>
In Ellensburg, before it was torn down the dorm Courson had many
paranormal moments on the 7th floor. In a room that was empty you could
hear the hangers banging in the closet, voices, and knocking. Knocking
on the doors, and nobody was there, shutting the door and then there
would be a loud bang like somebody kicked it, lights would flicker,
tv's would turn off and on, Bedroom lights were on from the outside of
the building and when you got back to your room, the light would be
off. One time two corkboards fell and landed at the same time as if
they had been pushed down. Closet Doors would open and close. Bedroom
doors would also even if the window wasnt open. Whispering and strange
noises in your room, and white orbs could be seen.. Very Very eery! The
only thing we could think of was that the ghost from Kamola was coming
over to visit. One of our grandfathers died that same year as well. <br>

stock in the basement under the restaurant.&nbsp; One night I was down
in the basement counting stock and&nbsp; I saw movement&nbsp; to my
right side.&nbsp; I saw the dark image of a man&nbsp; about&nbsp; 5'
10" tall about med build. The image was one&nbsp; I had seen before in
the attic portion of the building.&nbsp; I was never afraid, but&nbsp;
"he" made me aware that "he" was there. And when all was quiet later at
night while I was closing the business, I could hear footsteps above my
head in the attic portion of the building. One night I went up there to
see what I could see, and I swear in the middle of the summer I could
see my breath. I was never afraid. There was nothing to fear.<br>

when i was about nine years old i was in the woods riding my horse,
indy, and i was going a way i'd never gone before. i came to a creek
that i couldn't get over because my horse was not a jumping horse so i
went back and put my horse away then got my dog and went back into the
woods. when i finally got back to the creek. i was about to jump it
when i saw a girl about 12 floating off the creek about three, four
feet. she had black hair, wearing a night gown that was a old fancy
hight gown, she was holding a teddy ear. i only saw one glance aat her
but i still remember it. then a few weeks later i was at my friends
house down my road and the same woods were in her house to and i was
telling her about it and she said she had a friend over they were
playing 31(game i tought her) and then they went in to the forest and
they came to a creek(same creek as mine) and they saw her,too <br>

Haunted House in Orangevale, ca<br>
<br>
By: terigormley@yahoo.com <br>
<br>
Between 1966-1969 We (my large family of 12) lived in a house that we
had heard was haunted. We actually received a letter (before we bought
it and moved in) from someone who stated that they lived there and it
was diffidently haunted. But my Dad and Mom did not believe in spirits.
The sightings began almost immediately. On several occasions my parents
saw a man and a woman together standing over there bed. On one occasion
they heard a woman scream in our house and ran out to find the front
door open. My sister saw many spirits that she only shared with my
parents. And then one night I woke to a woman dressed in an old fashion
dress covering up my sister with a blanket. It looked like she was
covering her head and I didn't know who she was so I sat up in bed and
she turned around to look and be and disappeared. I told my parents and
my sister and that's when i found out about the spirits. <br>

My Cat's Visit<br>
<br>
By: Pittyting1066@aol.com<br>
<br>
In our former residence, one night I felt a cat jump up on my
bed.&nbsp; This was not unusual as we have had many cats in the past
and had five cats at the time.&nbsp; I felt the cat walk around me and
ending up at the top of the pillow.&nbsp; When I reached up to pet the
cat and&nbsp; to determine which of our pets had decided to grace me
with their presence, I found nothing. I had not heard the cat jump down
and when I turned on the lights, still no cat.&nbsp; I got up and
checked the couch in the den&nbsp; which was their favorite late night
roost. There they all were looking at me with sleep filled eyes,
wondering why I had disturbed their sleep by turning on the
lights.&nbsp; I realized I had just been visited by a former pet and
went back to bed with no fear, just curiosity.&nbsp; <br>

Premonition Message<br>
<br>
<br>

This happened to a group of us about 22 years ago when I was in the Boy
Scouts.&nbsp; One field trip we took was to Wright-Paterson Air Force
Base in Dayton, Ohio.&nbsp; It was the off-season, so there were hardly
any (if any) other visitors so we had the run of the museum (a
collection of various aircraft on display housed in large hangars).<br>
One of the aircraft was JFK's actual Air Force One jet, which you could
enter and walk around.&nbsp; We entered and looked around the plane
then exited and stood on that platform atop those stairs the President
is always shown waving from when he gets off or on.&nbsp; Due to the
vantage point, we could see out over the whole hangar.&nbsp; My eyes
were suddenly drawn to what appeared to be a modern commuter-type craft
(red and white) rolling near the back of the hangar, silently
taxiing.&nbsp; I called for the others to look and said something like,
"look, one of the planes got loose and is going to crash!"&nbsp; We
laughed and went down the stairs and ran down the center aisle where
the plane should have been to see the mess and looked around.&nbsp; No
plane.&nbsp; No open hangar door, and really no room for any sort of
plane to be rolling freely at all.&nbsp; The plane was simply
gone.&nbsp; We all looked at each other in total disbelief.&nbsp; I
still remember the wide eyes and open mouths.&nbsp; This&nbsp; wasn't
funny anymore, but didn't really seem scary.&nbsp; It was just plain
weird and totally unexplained.&nbsp; To date, this is the only
paranormal experience I have ever had.<br>
I told this story to some coworkers recently when the subject of
hauntings came up.&nbsp; One of them said, "maybe JFK was trying to
give you a message about his son."&nbsp; JFK junior was killed almost
11 years ago when his commuter plane went down in the ocean.<br>

Weird science<br>

I have posted here before and as I've said before, I have always been
spiritually sensitive.&nbsp; I posted the lonely little ghost girl post
while I was living in Massachusetts and the trip I had from NY to MD in
a snowstorm and stayed at the Hampton Inn near Elkton, MD.&nbsp; But I
have had many other spiritual experiences in my childhood that by
themselves don't mean much but collectively are kind of
disturbing.&nbsp; <br>
For some reason, all of these started with toys - either of my own or
toys belonging to other kids.&nbsp; They would do weird things when I
was around and everyone - including me - would be totally freaked
out.&nbsp; I was playing ball with another guy down the street, Don,
when I was about<br>
8 years old (this would have been around 1962) and his kid sister had
one of those big beauty parlor dolls that could have her hair washed
and styled as she sat in a swivel chair and put under a hair
dryer.&nbsp; She was up on top of a bookshelf across the room from
me.&nbsp; Her legs were spring-jointed at the knees so she looked real
when she sat in the chair.&nbsp; She was all dressed in prissy pink and
I thought she looked dumb.&nbsp; Even the hair dryer was pink.&nbsp; I
hate pink to this day.&nbsp; Don went upstairs to talk to his dad a
minute.&nbsp; No sooner had I looked at this doll and formed the
thought, "Jeez, what a STUPID doll!" then there was a sharp =BANG= and
both the doll's legs shot out of their sockets and flew across the room
like a pair of flesh-colored missles.&nbsp; Absolutely nothing else
happened other than the doll was now a double amputee.&nbsp; My
explanation of&nbsp; "the doll broke herself" didn't work.&nbsp; I got
my butt kicked by 2 sets of parents.&nbsp; At another kid's house we
were playing Army in his basement and HIS kid sister had a Little Miss
Echo.&nbsp; This one was a big doll that had a "magic bow" at her
throat that you turned one way and talked to her, then you turned the
"magic bow" the other way and she'd repeat what you just said.&nbsp; So
we were having a good ol' time on this rainy day hollering and making
sound effects and explosions while our armies were beating each other
up when Little Miss Echo went 'bleeeeeeep' all by herself on the other
side of the basement.&nbsp; She was standing on the floor facing us and
I got creeped out.&nbsp; "What was that?"<br>
I asked him, staring at the doll.&nbsp; "I dunno," he said.&nbsp; We
kept playing for about 5 minutes and again Little Miss Echo went
'bleeeeeeep' but then started playing back all the things we'd just
been saying and doing while our armies were beating each other
up.&nbsp; Another kid had a huge Remco "Mighty Matilda" aircraft
carrier that would move along the floor, pitching and rolling like it
was on the ocean.&nbsp; It had really cool weaponry, alarm bells,
signal lights and scale modeling.&nbsp; It would seize up and stop
working for no reason when I was around.&nbsp; I had a really cool
diesel locomotive that blew its whistle and had 'bump and go'<br>
action that would work fine for my other 3 brothers, but it would
always turn and come after me!&nbsp; I had a McDonnell-Douglas DC-6
that would idle all 4 turbo-props like it was sitting on the runway; it
would start rolling in a straight line, pivot slowly in a half-circle
as the cabin light lit up and the stewardess came out of the galley and
went down the aisle between the passengers.&nbsp; The cabin light would
shut off, the engines would rev up faster and faster, it would shoot
forward a couple of feet like it was going to take off and start all
over again.&nbsp; But there were times, for no reason at all, it would
just go around in a circle and do nothing else.&nbsp; Then I'd shut it
off and leave it alone until I thought it would work right a day or so
later.&nbsp; <br>
There were other things like this going on with me around toys:&nbsp;
passive toys like puzzles and mechanical toys like an erector set or
clockwork toys that wound up didn't "act up" with me.&nbsp; All the
problems seemed to revolve around toys that worked on batteries.&nbsp;
So I always took them apart (to the exasperation of my parents) to see
what made them work; I'd heard about "bugs" in machinery and wanted to
see if there were any bugs in my toys.&nbsp; I'd also heard about
"gremlins" making things go wrong but I had no idea what a gremlin was
until I saw the Twilight Zone episode with William Shatner - the one
with the gremlin on the wing of the DC-6 he was a passenger on.&nbsp; I
was terrified&nbsp; there might be gremlins doing things to my toys
when I wasn't around.<br>
To this day I still do weird things without trying.&nbsp; I can't wear
digital watches; I "short them out" and they stop working within a
matter of weeks.&nbsp; My cell phone will do really weird things like
chime for no reason when I don't have the alarm set or ring in an
incoming call with no one there.&nbsp; I will receive unexplainable
electrical shocks of some kind under all circumstances, even during
rainstorms and soggy wet weather when static electricity is supposed to
be at its weakest.<br>
My house barely missed getting hit by lightning about 15 years ago and
to this day weird electrical things happen, starting with my daughter's
toys turning on or talking in the middle of the night before a
thunderstorm hits.&nbsp; Lights will turn off and on that didn't do
that before the lightning strike.&nbsp; And all my life I have noticed
things move, fall off shelves or fly across the room when I am
extremely tense or agitated.&nbsp; I was helping a guy do some woodwork
years ago; he was using his battery powered drill and set it
down.&nbsp; It started up all by itself and shut itself off again.<br>

Ghosts<br>

I have had one experience when I was around&nbsp; 20 years old. I was
parked at a graveyard with my future husband. We were smooching lying
in the front seat when we both heard a creaking noise. The weekend
before this, a county sherriff had driven up behind us and told us to
go as there had been drinking going on there. So, our first thought was
this was happening again. I was the first to look behind through our
rear window. I saw an outline of what I thought was a man standing
there. It was a very good moonlit night. My boyfriend also turned to
look as I said yes there is someone there. He put his foot on the brake
and turned th keys to start the car. As he did this I was still looking
at the figure and it disappeared in front of my eyes. This was when I
lost my breath. He drove out of there very fast. We stopped a few miles
later where a drive in burger place still had outdoor lights to look at
the car for handprints. It had looked like the guy had his two hands on
the back of the car and it was a dusty road. There were no handprints
there. We to this day believe we saw something supernatural. We went
back with a friend the next day in day light to see the location. We
wanted to see if a tree branch could of been what we saw. There were no
tree branches that would of been in that view we saw the dark man. It
looked like the outline of a real man that was until he disappeared. We
both described the same thing later to each other as to what we saw.
This was in the late seventies.<br>

My Guardian Angel<br>
<br>
By: rockonprincess@yahoo.com<br>
&nbsp;<br>
OK this is my first time ever emailing you guys, so im little bit
nervous.&nbsp; I've actually been hesitating whether or not i should
send u my story.&nbsp; But n-e-ways...... <br>
And ive lived in my current house for 8 years now.&nbsp; Now this story
might be a little "amatur-ish" becuz its just a little story that isnt
even that drastic.&nbsp; But I thought I'd come on here and share with
you the little ghostly experiances that ive had.&nbsp; So lets get
started.<br>
Ok so like 10 years ago in September of 98 (I was 5), my grandfather
passed away of throat cancer.&nbsp; Now let me tell you, when i was
born, he loved me so much that he wanted 10 of me!&nbsp; I was his
favorite grandchild!&nbsp; Shortly after he died, things started 2
happen.&nbsp; For example, when he was alive, everyday around 2:15p.m.,
he would call my mom and ask her if she needed n-e-thing from the
store.&nbsp; So about a week after he passed away, my mom started
getting these weird phone calls from the number that he use to call her
from.&nbsp; When she would answer the phone, nobody would be on the
other end.&nbsp; She saw it was from my grandfather's house number so
she freaked out and we went over to him and my grandmother's house (The
house that i currently live in)to see if n-e-one was there. So when we
got there, no one was in the house!&nbsp; My grandmother was at work,
my uncle was at work, and my two cuzins didnt have a key to the
house.&nbsp; <br>
Then when christmas time came, another incident occured.&nbsp; And may
I might add that his birthday was on christmas day.&nbsp; So a week or
two before christmas, me and my mom were decorating my grandmothers
christmas tree.&nbsp; And we had christmas music on and
everything.&nbsp; So me and my mom were dancing together to the
christmas music when my mom fell and hit her head on the T.V.&nbsp; She
was ok but when she sat up she just stared at the corner of the little
corridor that leads to the front door.&nbsp; She would not stop staring
so i said "Mommy what are you looking at?".&nbsp; She wouldnt answer,
she just kept staring.&nbsp; So i said it again "Mommy what are you
looking at!".&nbsp; She still didnt answer me.&nbsp; So i shook her and
i yelled "MOMMY!&nbsp; WHATS WRONG!&nbsp; WHAT DO YOU KEEP LOOKING
AT!"&nbsp; Thats when she finally looked up at me and said "Oh my
god.&nbsp; I think I just saw your grandfather."&nbsp; So she got up
and went to my grandmother and told her what happened.&nbsp; She said
she saw like a white outlining of my grandfathers body peeking around
the corner.&nbsp; That scared the "you know what" out of my grandmother
and I.&nbsp; <br>
Make a long story short, me and my mom moved into that house to keep my
grandmother company (Also because my mom and dad got a divorce and we
left my dad). Then a few weeks later, my mom was sleeping in her bed,
which was originally my grandfathers bed.&nbsp; It was early morning
and the sun was already up.&nbsp; She woke up to the sound of my
grandfather yelling "Sylvia!" (Thats my moms name).&nbsp; It sounded as
if something was wrong or like he needed her for something.&nbsp; She
said she heard it so loud that jumped and woke up.&nbsp; When she woke
up, nobody was there in the room.<br>
Shortly after we moved in, things started to happen to me!&nbsp; Let me
first tell you that when ur in the middle of our living room, on your
right is the hallway leading to all of our bedrooms.&nbsp; So all the
time when i would be sitting in the middle of the living room watching
T.V., at the corner of my eye I would see a fuzzy oval shaped dark
cloud standing at the end of the hallway.&nbsp; Sometimes the cloud
would be brown, then it would be black, then it would be gray.&nbsp;
This would go on on a daily basis.&nbsp; My grandmother would see the
same thing, too.&nbsp; She would be sitting on the couch doing her
bills and she would see a white cloud peeking around the kitchen
corner.&nbsp; This went on for a few years.&nbsp; Then it just
stopped.&nbsp; I stopped seeing that fuzzy figure.&nbsp; Or maybe i did
but i just didnt notice.&nbsp; But then just recently, it started up
again.&nbsp; Things started to happen about a year ago. <br>
Last January of 2008, things started to happen.&nbsp; But the weird
thing is that they would only happen to me.&nbsp; No one else would
have these experiances.&nbsp; So one day last January of 2008, i was
home alone.&nbsp; I was in my moms room (Originally my grandfathers
room) just watching T.V. and i had the door closed.&nbsp; As i was
watching T.V., i heard someone outside the room clear their
throat.&nbsp; Then i began to hear things moving around in the kitchen
and in the living room.&nbsp; So i just thought it was my mom and
grandmother coming home from the store.&nbsp; So i thought that my mom
was gonna walk into the room at n-e second.&nbsp; But she didnt and i
thought that was kinda weird so i went to the bedroom door and opened
and i just stood there because i didnt hear n-e-thing n-e-more.&nbsp; I
was just waiting for my mom or grandma to walk by but they didnt.&nbsp;
So i just closed the door and continued watching T.V.&nbsp; But then i
started to hear it again.&nbsp; Once again i started hearing as if
somebody came home.&nbsp; So i muted the T.V. and went to the door and
opened it again.&nbsp; I didnt walk out to check the house like n-e
other stupid fool in the horror movies would, no i just stood there
waiting for my mom or grandma to walk by.&nbsp; Nothing happened.&nbsp;
So i closed the door and just stood there staring at it.&nbsp; Then i
put my ear up to the door to see if i could hear n-e-thing.&nbsp; And
you'll never believe what i heard.&nbsp; I heard someone walk pass the
door 3 times!&nbsp; And you know that sound you make when you walk
across the carpet?&nbsp; It was that sound.&nbsp; Because all we have
is carpet in the house.&nbsp; So yea i didnt hear footsteps, i heard
shuffling as if someone was walking pass the doorway.&nbsp; So i
totally freaked out and ran to the other end of the room, hid under my
grandfathers old desk, and called my friend and told her what had
happened.&nbsp; I was hysterical.&nbsp; Then finally my mom and
grandmother came home for real.&nbsp; I told them all about it.&nbsp;
My mom believed me and said that it was just my grandfather.&nbsp; But
my grandmother was trying to make sense out of it and said that it was
probably jus the air conditioning making all that noise.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
So from that day on, on a daily basis, everyday and everynight, i would
feel as if someone was watching me.&nbsp; Even when i would be alone in
my own room.&nbsp; Like right now as im typing this, i feel my
grandfathers presence.<br>
Make a long story short,&nbsp; 4 months later in May, his twin sister
passed away.&nbsp; And ever since she died,&nbsp; i havent been feeling
his presence that often.&nbsp; I still do but just not as often as i
use to.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now remember earlier in this story, i mentioned
that we would get these weird phone calls?&nbsp; Well a month after his
sister passed away, i got a phone call at 2:15p.m. from an unknown
caller.&nbsp; I picked it up and no one was there.&nbsp; Once again,
that happened when i was home by myself.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
Then just two weeks ago, i think i might have saw him.&nbsp; I was
standing in the kitchen wit my mom and our roommate of 5 months,
Emily.&nbsp; This was at night time.&nbsp; And at night we turn off all
the lights in the living room but we leave one on in the kitchen.&nbsp;
Now from where i was standing, if u looked to your left, you could see
the living room.&nbsp; So i was talking to my mom and Emily.&nbsp; Then
all of a sudden my eyes twitched and i was like blinking really fast
for like two seconds.&nbsp; When this happened, i saw a white flash go
across the living room.&nbsp; Then i looked and nothing was
there.&nbsp; I started freaking out then i started crying.&nbsp; <br>
I dont know.&nbsp; Maybe hes just my gaurian angel.&nbsp; I hope he
stays with me my whole life.&nbsp; Im sure he will.<br>
But n-e-ways, thats my story.&nbsp; These are the things that&nbsp;
have happened in our house over the past 10 years.&nbsp; Thank you so
much for taking the time to read this.<br>

My Great Grandma<br>
<br>
By: smhagedon@aol.com<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<br>
My great grandmother was a great lady, she was very old, I was very
young.&nbsp; We used to sit side by side in her Lazy boy chair and she
would read to me.&nbsp; She made these great cinnamon apples, I loved
them.&nbsp; In 1980 when she was 80yrs old she moved off of the blue
grass &#8220;which was a road her house was on&#8221;, into town.&nbsp; She moved
into one of those senior citizen high rises.&nbsp; You know the kind
that you have to call every morning just to let them know you are still
kicking.&nbsp; They left her alone as long as she called in.&nbsp; One
day she had some light chest pains so she called my Grandpa to come and
take her to the hospital.&nbsp; The doctor said she had a mild cardiac
episode and normally would have just sent her home but being she was
now 98yrs old that he wanted to put her in a nursing home for a couple
of days just to keep and eye on her.&nbsp; She had a sister" I really
don&#8217;t know much about her", just that she lived in a nursing home in
Chicago and had lived there for many years.&nbsp; I think she was
mistreated by the staff or so my Great grandma thought.&nbsp; She told
the Doc that she would not be going to any nursing home.&nbsp; The
doctor told her to sleep on it.&nbsp; My Grandfather was get ting ready
to go home for the night and my Great Grandmother told him good bye and
that she loved him very much.&nbsp; &#8220;she had not told him that in 50yrs
or so&#8221;.&nbsp; I believe she had decided that she had lived a good long
life and at 11:30pm that night she gave up that ghost.&nbsp; That is a
interesting story but what gets me is 700miles away at 11:45pm Great
grandma&#8217;s sister who had been in the nursing home in Chicago
died.&nbsp; I believe Grandma went to Chicago and got her and they went
home together. I loved my great grandma.&nbsp; <br>

Night time encounters<br>
<br>
By: pinkrabbit25@hotmail.com <br>
<br>
For countless nights I have experienced some mild but unexplainable
things.&nbsp; For example, there's a T.V in my room and one night,
while I was talking to my brother about ghosts, it suddenly turned on
by itself.&nbsp; I wasn't really sure if ghosts had anything to do with
it because that kind of thing probably happens to everyone.&nbsp;
Anyway, one of those nights, when I was by myself, I was sleeping when
suddenly I found it hard to breathe;&nbsp; I do not have asthma.&nbsp;
Then I felt as if someone were on top of me.&nbsp; I realized what this
was and began to pray to St. Michael the archangel in my mind.&nbsp;
The weight lifted a bit...then came back down, heavier than
before.&nbsp; Then, I felt as if there were paint brush strokes on my
face and invisible hands were gently stretching out my face, making it
an easier surface to paint on.&nbsp; On other nights, I felt hands near
my feet.&nbsp; When I reached down to brush them away, I could
definately feel that there were hands... a man's hands; one night it
grabbed my ankle.&nbsp; But whenever I felt the hands, it was weird
because it didn't feel solid, but I could feel there was something
there.&nbsp; One night, I felt as if I was being kissed.&nbsp;
Weird.&nbsp; And on rare occasions, while I was having trouble
breathing, I felt my mouth being forced wide open.&nbsp; And then I
began to shake uncontrollably for a few seconds; but I wasn't cold so
they weren't chills and I'm not epileptic.&nbsp; I tried to cry out but
I couldn't make a sound.&nbsp; On another occasion, I felt as if I had
just been whipped in the face with a jacket with a zipper.&nbsp; It
didn't really hurt but it caught me by surprise.&nbsp; And after that,
I felt as if a fist was pushing down on my teeth and gums.&nbsp; The
pressure on my teeth didn't subside till about a minute later.&nbsp; It
happened on two separate occasions.&nbsp; Recently, not much has
happened.&nbsp; Sometimes these things happen for consecutive
nights.&nbsp; I sleep with a crucifix near my head and another one on
top of the T.V but I don't know if that makes a difference..&nbsp;
Although these things don't affect anyone else in my household, I'm not
really frightened by them.&nbsp; Instead, I feel a sense of calm
overwhelm me whenever they occur.&nbsp; However, I still insist that my
door be left ajar.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </big>
