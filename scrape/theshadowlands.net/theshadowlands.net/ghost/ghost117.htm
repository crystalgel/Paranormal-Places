<b>"George"</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: Nanrct@aol.com</b>

<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;My family and I have a ghost that only seems to visit us around
the</b>
<br><b>hoilday season.</b>
<br><b>First, let me tell you, our house was once an old farm house, but
the last</b>
<br><b>family that owned it remodeled and added a back room, by enclosing
part of</b>
<br><b>the drive way.&nbsp; They also added a bedroom, which is where most
of the</b>
<br><b>happenings are. "George", as we call him, isn't in to moving things
or</b>
<br><b>making sounds...he just likes bright, moving lights.</b>
<br><b>We have a picture frame that we bring out only for christmas, it
has many</b>
<br><b>bright lights on it, and it plays a song.."George" LOVES this frame!&nbsp;
Even</b>
<br><b>after the song and lights stop, we can still watch the lights flashing,</b>
<br><b>and sometimes even see a vague shape standing in front of the frame...rocking</b>
<br><b>back and forth, enjoying the lights!</b>
<br><b>Another occurance happened to my daughter.&nbsp; She recieved a
talking "star</b>
<br><b>trek" bank for christmas a few years ago, and "Geroge" seems to
like it,</b>
<br><b>too! A few times, when my daughter has walked into her room, the
bank would off</b>
<br><b>by itself!&nbsp; The first time it happened, my daughter came running
out of her</b>
<br><b>room, scared to death!&nbsp; I just told her that "Geroge" was saying
"hi", and</b>
<br><b>to not worry about it.&nbsp; I think she has gotten used to it..now
she just comes</b>
<br><b>out of her room and says " Geroge" is here......and goes back into
her</b>
<br><b>room! But, one thing that "Geroge" doesn't seem to fond of is loud
music. Many</b>
<br><b>times my daughter will have her radio on too loud, and he'll just
shut it</b>
<br><b>off!&nbsp; It really makes my daughter mad! Well, I just wanted
to share my story.</b>
<br><b>Thanks!</b>

<p><b>The Attic</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: JAMES LANE</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For some reason I have yet to understand, my mother
had a talent for buying the oldest, creepiest house on the block. One that
stood out was in the oldest neighborhood in my hometown. It was at the
base of Lookout Mountain, for all you Civil War buffs. Most of the houses</b>
<br><b>were in excess of 100 years old, most remolded or restored to their
original design.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The house my mother had purchased the house in
the late spring, and we had to wait for central air and heating to be installed,
and the oldheater disconnected. The front door opend into a hallway that
ran straight to the rear of the house. As you walked into the door, there
was a bedroom to the left and one to the right, both with nice fireplaces.
Continuing past the bedroom doors, you went through a walk-thru(?)closet
and entered the formal dining room. The right,rear corner of this room
lead to a doorway into a third bedroom. The rest ofthe house</b>
<br><b>had been remodeled-this was a living room ( to the left of the dining
room), a kitchen (connected to the living room), a utility room and a bath-room.
The original bathroom encompassed the "new" bathroom and the third bathroom.
This room had to have been 15.5 ft by 10.5 ft. The</b>
<br><b>40 gallon clawfoot tub was still in the house.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that
you have the layout, here's the story. We finally moved in to this nice
house, with brand new siding, 10.5 ft by 3 ft windows, and</b>
<br><b>13ft high ceiling. The house was very tall, but as a 15 year old,
you don't catch that quickly. We start moving in, myself grabbing one front
room with a nice mantle over the fireplace. From day one I would hear noises
from the ceiling, but though "old house". The thump in the night</b>
<br><b>was nothing, but as time went by I graduated and went to work in
the early afternoon, getting off around 11pm or 12am. I would sit in my
at night, trying to wind down, and hear distinct footsteps over my head.
From time to time I though I could hear something heavy moving</b>
<br><b>across the roof, but the trees were a good distance from the house.
After awhile I just got used to it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometime later, my mother
decided that it was time to put me to work finishing the renovation/remodeling
of the house. My first room was</b>
<br><b>to be the back, third bedroom. As I removed plaster to put up paneling,
I found a very old fuse box. I was amazed because the breaker box was in
the kitchen, and old ones are usually replaced with the new in the same
location. My next suprise was a hot/cold set of pipes</b>
<br><b>running up the wall to the roof. At this point, I did not think
the house had an attic space, and never saw a door to one.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
After the bedroom, and more months of endless dragging and footsteps, I
went to the walk-thru closet. There had been a cubby hole</b>
<br><b>about 10ft (low ceiling) in the center of the closet. I figured
a storage area and opened up my ladder to move some boxes we had stored
in the back bedroom. I got up in the "cubby hole" and learned a lot about
this house. I had crawled up to the last 4 steps of a stairway.</b>
<br><b>I yelled to my stepfather to bring a flashlight and he came up.
For some reason, during remodeling, a second floor had been sealed off
from the rest of the house. Turn of the century furniture still there in
dusty,but good shape. Over my room, we had found a study/office</b>
<br><b>with a rolltop desk, wood chair, and a bookcase. There was 2 other
bedroom, a bathroom, and a baby's room as well. I could never find out
anything about the house, but atleast I think we were not the only ones
there.</b><b></b>

<br><b>My Ghost Experiences</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: sweetasadevil74@yahoo.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I've lived in Southern California my entire life, Im</b>
<br><b>17 now, I've always been very sensitve to things of</b>
<br><b>the paranormal nature, and I've always been very</b>
<br><b>interested in other peoples experiences, When I was</b>
<br><b>seven, my family moved into this old house, probably</b>
<br><b>built in the early 1940's, it was huge, it had 5</b>
<br><b>bedrooms, it was 3 storys, the previous owners had</b>
<br><b>turned the attic into two bedrooms and a bathroom, my</b>
<br><b>parents slept in the large room upstairs and I slept</b>
<br><b>down the hall in the other room, My two older brothers</b>
<br><b>downstairs. As soon as we moved in I could defintely</b>
<br><b>tell there was something in the house, just a creepy</b>
<br><b>feeling, like someone was watching every move you</b>
<br><b>made, it wasn't until we had lived there a few months</b>
<br><b>before things started to happen, at first it was just</b>
<br><b>me that noticed it, every night at the same time I</b>
<br><b>could hear heavy footsteps coming up the stairs, but</b>
<br><b>what was so weird was that as soon as it got to the</b>
<br><b>top, it would stop, then start over again. Doors</b>
<br><b>opened and closed by themselves, my radio would turn</b>
<br><b>on and off, lights flickered, things would be missing</b>
<br><b>then show up later in weird places. I always saw</b>
<br><b>someone standing by my doorway, or Id see something</b>
<br><b>out the corner of my eye, a few times, I heard someone</b>
<br><b>in my room, walking, moving things, Id sit up turn on</b>
<br><b>my light and there would be no one there, I told them</b>
<br><b>but they laughed at me and told me it was my</b>
<br><b>imagination.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;My Dad had to get up early each morning around 4:30</b>
<br><b>to go to work, around that time my mom had cancer, she</b>
<br><b>had to have surgery, and since their room was upstairs</b>
<br><b>and she was sore, she slept on the couch, my dad slept</b>
<br><b>upstairs, one morning my dad got up like always, took</b>
<br><b>his shower, did his usual, when he came out he noticed</b>
<br><b>a thumping coming from downstairs, he thought it was</b>
<br><b>my mom up moving around, he looked down the stairs and</b>
<br><b>it was pitch black, being as skeptical as he is he</b>
<br><b>just brushed it off as the dog or something, went in</b>
<br><b>his room to finish getting ready, as he went into his</b>
<br><b>room the thumping got louder, he said it sounded like</b>
<br><b>someone was moving furniture around, he went</b>
<br><b>downstairs and went up to the couch where my mom was</b>
<br><b>laying to check on her, she was awake, he asked her if</b>
<br><b>she was making that noise, my mom said that she</b>
<br><b>couldn't sleep, and she hadn't heard any noise, she</b>
<br><b>was too sick to even get up. They tried to figure out</b>
<br><b>what it could've been, it was too loud and clear for</b>
<br><b>him to have imagined it, and all the dogs and cats we</b>
<br><b>had were outside. My brothers and I weren't home, To</b>
<br><b>this day he still doesn't like to talk about it.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;There was another incident that happened while we</b>
<br><b>were living there that still gives me goosebumps</b>
<br><b>thinking about it. We were all downstairs watching tv,</b>
<br><b>my parents room was directly above us, we heard this</b>
<br><b>loud thump, it shook the entire house, my dad and</b>
<br><b>brother thought maybe it was someone trying to brake</b>
<br><b>in and grabbed baseball bats and went up to check it</b>
<br><b>out, I followed, at a safe distance of course, but</b>
<br><b>there was nothing there, they couldnt find anything</b>
<br><b>that could've made such a loud noise, everything was</b>
<br><b>how it had been, nothing moved or broken.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;A few years after, my great grandmother moved in, she</b>
<br><b>was in her late 80's, she wasn't in good condition, so</b>
<br><b>my mom was taking care of her, I remember one</b>
<br><b>incident, she became hysterical, she was screaming,</b>
<br><b>saying there were people in her room, and that all the</b>
<br><b>walls were covered in blood, she said in the hallway</b>
<br><b>there were rattlesnakes, she started crying begging my</b>
<br><b>mom to make them go away. I never saw her like that</b>
<br><b>before or after that, Im not sure what it was about</b>
<br><b>that house, but no one who entered the house could</b>
<br><b>deny it, there was something mean, threatening about</b>
<br><b>it, I would have weird dreams, my friends wouldn't</b>
<br><b>come over, and kids at my school told me stories about</b>
<br><b>it, I hated living there.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Since, I've had a few other run ins with what I</b>
<br><b>believe have been ghosts. Nothing as traumatizing as</b>
<br><b>living in that house, but maybe I'll share it another</b>
<br><b>time. Thank you for reading.</b><b></b>

<p><b>My Guardian, Playmate, and Killer....</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: ladyz_17011@yahoo.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I was three years old when these events occurred but I</b>
<br><b>remember them better than I can remember what I had</b>
<br><b>for breakfast today, I also can remember my brother</b>
<br><b>being a baby, we are two years apart in age.&nbsp; It was a</b>
<br><b>large old two story house, I have later been told that</b>
<br><b>there was an Indian graveyard about a hundred and</b>
<br><b>fifty yards behind the house in the woods.&nbsp; None of</b>
<br><b>our dogs ever stayed for long, my Dad used to hunt so</b>
<br><b>we had lots of hounds, they used to growl and whine at</b>
<br><b>the empty air and many mornings we'd wake up and one</b>
<br><b>or two were gone.&nbsp; This went on until the entire pack</b>
<br><b>was gone.&nbsp; When you drove down the lane to my house</b>
<br><b>there was always this one area that was ice cold, it</b>
<br><b>only lasted for a few seconds and then you were</b>
<br><b>through it.&nbsp; There were three spirits that I could</b>
<br><b>see, they did not have actual features they were more</b>
<br><b>like dark shadows but I remember feeling that they</b>
<br><b>were the genders of a man, a woman, and a boy.&nbsp; Even</b>
<br><b>now I feel that these were their genders and there is</b>
<br><b>no doubt or uncertainty.&nbsp; Each one had a role in my</b>
<br><b>life...the child played with me, the woman protected</b>
<br><b>me, and the man tried to kill me.&nbsp; I know that may</b>
<br><b>sound harsh but just as I am sure of the feeling about</b>
<br><b>their genders I am still just as sure of the feeling</b>
<br><b>that the man wanted to harm me...and as I tell you my</b>
<br><b>story you will see just how often he tried to.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>remember the man would stand at the top of the stairs</b>
<br><b>or in doorways watching me I felt that he hated me but</b>
<br><b>he wouldn't bother me when one of the other spirits</b>
<br><b>were with me.&nbsp; I remember being in the hallways or my</b>
<br><b>bedroom playing with the little boy, which is all I</b>
<br><b>can remember of him.&nbsp; The woman always made me feel</b>
<br><b>loved and protected, she was always around to save me.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;She used to stand at the foot of my bed at night like</b>
<br><b>she was keeping watch.&nbsp; My Mom used to put me in a</b>
<br><b>little tin tub outside the bathroom when she took a</b>
<br><b>bath, she would crack the door so that she could peep</b>
<br><b>out at me.&nbsp; I remember watching the man come down the</b>
<br><b>hall at me, he took the handle of the tub and pulled</b>
<br><b>it to the head of the stairs and left it so that if I</b>
<br><b>had moved around the tub would fall down the stairs.</b>
<br><b>Immediately after he left the woman came and pulled me</b>
<br><b>back towards the bathroom, the tub stopped moving just</b>
<br><b>as my Mom came out&nbsp; of the bathroom door.&nbsp; I don't</b>
<br><b>remember telling my Mom anything then, but in the</b>
<br><b>later incidents I did tell her.&nbsp; As I said the house</b>
<br><b>was in the woods so there were times when snakes</b>
<br><b>showed up in the house, especially in the pantry the</b>
<br><b>ground in there was dirt.&nbsp; I remember I was going down</b>
<br><b>the stairs into the pantry as I went to step off the</b>
<br><b>last step I saw this big black snake, I screamed and</b>
<br><b>fell up the stairs trying to run.&nbsp; Dad came and he</b>
<br><b>searched and never found anything that even resembled</b>
<br><b>a snake, he made sure nothing was ever left on the</b>
<br><b>floor because of the possiblity of running across a</b>
<br><b>snake.&nbsp; Back then we had pot belly stoves in the</b>
<br><b>house, I remember going to walk past it and the man</b>
<br><b>pushed me, I did fall head first into the stove but</b>
<br><b>just as my face hit the woman put her hand there, I</b>
<br><b>remeber feeling the coolness of her touch.&nbsp; My Mom saw</b>
<br><b>me fall into the stove and even she has told people</b>
<br><b>she can't figure out why my face wasn't scarred.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>told her that the man had pushed me and the woman kept</b>
<br><b>me from burning myself.&nbsp; My Mom was really scared</b>
<br><b>because she had noticed that things were always moving</b>
<br><b>and that lights turned off and on in the house.&nbsp; The</b>
<br><b>last two things I remember, one of which caused my</b>
<br><b>Mom, me, and my brother to leave and never go back to</b>
<br><b>the house...I was playing at the bottom of the stairs</b>
<br><b>and I just stopped and stared up the steps.&nbsp; My Mom</b>
<br><b>holding my brother came and stood over me asking me</b>
<br><b>what I was doing and I told her that the man was going</b>
<br><b>to kill me.&nbsp; She couldn't see him so she asked what</b>
<br><b>man and I told her the man at the top of the steps</b>
<br><b>with the gun, she has since told me that when she</b>
<br><b>looked up there was a big ceramic lamp teetering at</b>
<br><b>the top of the stairs that she knew should not have</b>
<br><b>been there.&nbsp; I remember her grabbing me and putting me</b>
<br><b>and my brother in the car, when I looked back at the</b>
<br><b>house from the car I saw the woman and child in one</b>
<br><b>window and I felt them telling me Good-bye, in another</b>
<br><b>window I saw the man and still I felt only hate.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>would have liked to be able to go back to the house as</b>
<br><b>an adult but my Mom told me that it was torn down when</b>
<br><b>I was still young.&nbsp; I often wonder if they are still</b>
<br><b>with me, or if they were tied to the house.</b>

<br><b>A Two-Night Stay at The Myrtles.</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: MissSherie@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;My sister and I have always wanted to take a trip together
and finally</b>
<br><b>got to do so recently..it was middle November and between the holidays.
I have</b>
<br><b>been to Louisiana and one who loves New Orleans and it's history
and the</b>
<br><b>old homes of the south particularly in Louisiana. I had read about
the Myrtles</b>
<br><b>recently around Halloween , had heard of it before as historical
Louisiana</b>
<br><b>nd also for it's cuisine in the carriage house restaurant...perfect
get</b>
<br><b>away for two sisters that wanted to do the chat thing and relax.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Upon our arrival we went to the front of the house and rang
the bell,</b>
<br><b>surprised no one answered then proceeded to the back of the house
to the</b>
<br><b>shop...reservations made there and yes, they knew we were coming...it
was</b>
<br><b>about 4:30 so seems they should have answered the door.. there was
a black</b>
<br><b>woman saying she was waiting for us, they had no other reservations
and</b>
<br><b>gave us two keys, one for the William Winters' room and one for
the first floor</b>
<br><b>suite either at the our same quoted rate.</b>
<br><b>We loved that idea so we took a look at both rooms, by ourselves,
Hester</b>
<br><b>refused to go up with us...at this point we knew so little that
we gladly</b>
<br><b>went alone.</b>
<br><b>After deciding on the William Winters' room, we started to</b>
<br><b>unpack.........and looking back that is when things were beginning
to happen even unbeknownst</b>
<br><b>to us.</b>
<br><b>My mood suddenly shifted drastically, and i was not really aware
that it</b>
<br><b>was or why. I suddenly wondered if we had gotten ripped off and
should we really stay</b>
<br><b>here, no phone or tv. ....even for sisters that could get boring....and</b>
<br><b>besides, i had a mint julep in my mind the moment we got there only
to</b>
<br><b>find there was no bar anywhere except at the restaurant and it was
closed on</b>
<br><b>Tues.&nbsp; Then I began to change clothes and was totally confused,
could not find</b>
<br><b>anything and just really scatter brained....My sister was looking
at me</b>
<br><b>strangely so we left for a restaurant about 8 mi. away.</b>
<br><b>On the ride i was in a trance like state and kept trying to snap
out of</b>
<br><b>it....thought maybe i was hungry or tired or....anything. This lasted
til</b>
<br><b>about the time we sat down to order our food...looking back I had
another</b>
<br><b>experience that created a stress syndrome and that is exactly what
i was</b>
<br><b>in...only for about 30 minutes.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; When we returned to the Myrtles, we found every person gone....not
a</b>
<br><b>soul around, then someone came out of the store (it was closed)...one
of the</b>
<br><b>workers that told us there would be one person on the premises,
back in a</b>
<br><b>small house on the property that lived there....so one would have
to</b>
<br><b>awaken this person only in emergency.</b>
<br><b>we proceeded to the room and could not figure out how to lock the
door,</b>
<br><b>there was a small button to push and since no one showed us anything
we missed</b>
<br><b>it trying to lock with key.......so off I went to the little house,
about</b>
<br><b>7:30, and thinking any mugger could enter and word in a small town
travels fast</b>
<br><b>that hotel guests are alone.</b>
<br><b>When I knocked on the door after crossing the dark grounds and beginning</b>
<br><b>to feel a little uncomfortable, i found no one there.&nbsp; So,
being afraid of</b>
<br><b>snakes and a moldy pond laying near, I began to call at my sister
on the</b>
<br><b>porch.....about that time the car drove up and it was the person
living</b>
<br><b>there, Diane, . She laughed and said she had just gotten in from
work,</b>
<br><b>apologized since she had been told we would be there alone.&nbsp;
I thought</b>
<br><b>that strange, why would they tell her that, ....everyone else leaves
at 4 or</b>
<br><b>430 before sundown, i found out later. So, without going to the
house she told</b>
<br><b>us how to lock the door, and then told us she had never been in
the house,</b>
<br><b>and alot of people leave in the night.....huh.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; When we got upstairs, I had a hard time adjusting to the
silence, that</b>
<br><b>house was silent until it wrapped around you....and i was used to
cell</b>
<br><b>phone, tv and radio all at once. So we proceeded to settle down
for the night and</b>
<br><b>yet did not change because it was chilly ....we went out to see
the</b>
<br><b>meteorites that were suppose to pass in the sky that night and began
to</b>
<br><b>feel odd the only ones there (except for Diane) not a sound...so
then we began</b>
<br><b>to talk of staying there......(oh yes, that afternoon while i was
unpacking</b>
<br><b>and confused my left ear kept closing up and ringing)</b>
<br><b>Even now, when i tell the story , the very things that we experienced
were</b>
<br><b>being warded off in my mind so that i forget to include them....just</b>
<br><b>before we left for dinner and while i was still confused...we heard
right by the</b>
<br><b>window in the Winters room a who - who.....I said oh, that is an
owl....my</b>
<br><b>sister lives in the country with horses and is a great lover of
animals</b>
<br><b>and nature and she said no, that is no owl.....we shrugged it off
and went to</b>
<br><b>dinner.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;The worker came out of the shop, she was decorating the small
bathroom</b>
<br><b>for the other workers and began conversation...........she told
us the story</b>
<br><b>of a slave that got her ear cut off...and that the slaves on the
property hung</b>
<br><b>her later for killing two children and the lady of the house....she
was having</b>
<br><b>an affair with the master of the house.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; We suddenly realized what we had gotten ourselves into.....so
when it</b>
<br><b>was time to go upstairs we were more than a little nervous....so
we kept</b>
<br><b>sweaters and jeans on since being on the patio was chilly anyway.........the</b>
<br><b>deafening silence and it seemed to be getting colder....no way were
we ready to</b>
<br><b>sleep so we talked and tried to settle down.....then about 12:45
my sister</b>
<br><b>decided this was stupid and we should not be paying $175 for a room
with no</b>
<br><b>heat....we went to wake up Diane. Also, my sister was getting pretty</b>
<br><b>nervous.....Diane had no answer for the heat and suggested we take
one of</b>
<br><b>the rooms on the grounds and talk to them in the morning...my sister
quickly</b>
<br><b>said ok, afterall, we had checked the thermostat and reset it about
10 times.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When we were settled in the other room,
we fell asleep and I had a</b>
<br><b>dream about the master of the house he was standing next to a light
colored</b>
<br><b>fireplace and telling me how sad he was about the murders...he didnt
mean</b>
<br><b>to kill the children...AHA</b>
<br><b>i knew in my bones somehow I had connected with the truth and the
truth is</b>
<br><b>and I believe it still, his name was Woodruff and he meant to kill
is wife</b>
<br><b>, he was behind it all and mistakenly also killed the children,
and then</b>
<br><b>Chloe the slave was given the blame...........to me that is why
Chloe still is</b>
<br><b>there, she didnt kill the children...I wanted to tell the whole
world</b>
<br><b>cause suddenly i knew why Chloe could not go on.</b>
<br><b>Anyway, the next morning, we went to the desk and complained and
they</b>
<br><b>apologized and Hester reluctantly went upstairs and the whole time
we were</b>
<br><b>adjusting the wrong thermostat.......but it seemed bone cold to
me.&nbsp; We</b>
<br><b>took the tour of the house and finally heard the story in it's entirety
and low</b>
<br><b>and behold it was the left ear cut off.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; That night we planned to stay in the same room, since we
were told that</b>
<br><b>a couple was going to take the room across from us. And, since the</b>
<br><b>thermostat worked.</b>
<br><b>IN the tour we also learned the story about the girl that died in
the</b>
<br><b>Winters room of typhoid fever..and that one could still hear her
cry.......(not an</b>
<br><b>owl) That afternoon, time to change for dinner at the carriage house,
the</b>
<br><b>grounds were alive and the restaurant full, just as i had imagined
it would have</b>
<br><b>been.&nbsp; Well, we were still nervous in our room, but nothing
going on, so I</b>
<br><b>had to take a bath, Very nervous about that just didnt want</b>
<br><b>to.............Susan (sister) stood right there in the doorway talking
to</b>
<br><b>me cause i was very uncomfortable.....then we heard the door slam
and racket</b>
<br><b>in the stairwell ....here come our new neighbors....we could not
wait to meet</b>
<br><b>them and we finally relaxed....I told her i bet i could pick them
out at</b>
<br><b>the restaurant.&nbsp; We finally had our mint julep and dinner and
then saw</b>
<br><b>the couple open the door to the main hallway..the other door of
the house from where</b>
<br><b>we were. and we laughed as we watched the man trying to figure the
lock. then</b>
<br><b>we thought oh, they are not going to be nex to us, darn, and we
wanted</b>
<br><b>company.....it was not until the next morning, and Susan was aware
then,</b>
<br><b>that if they were staying there why did we hear them checking in
at 5:oo at the</b>
<br><b>other room?</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; Back to the room we went after another watch for meteroites
in the sky</b>
<br><b>(never appeared) like the weatherman said. Nice and cozy, but we
are still</b>
<br><b>uneasy saying we wished the couple was here and not on the other
side of</b>
<br><b>the house....we were in the original house, they were on the added
part. We</b>
<br><b>got into bed exhausted from the night before and yet began feeling
really</b>
<br><b>uneasy...Susan put her head under the pillow and it got hotter and
hotter</b>
<br><b>and hotter...it was so hot..she fell asleep and all of a sudden
i heard "the</b>
<br><b>owl" at the same place , now I knew it was the crying of a child</b>
<br><b>I laid there and susan awoke and said she was sooo hot and she was</b>
<br><b>sweating and she could hear the cry......we tried to lay there and
susan put her</b>
<br><b>head under the pillow, we heard knocking around downstairs and did
not budge. I</b>
<br><b>was on my side and had the gosh awful feeling, but calm, then my
heart</b>
<br><b>began racing on its own, i didnt say a word just kinda told myself
to go to</b>
<br><b>sleep, my heart raced on its own i was not afraid at this moment....like
when one</b>
<br><b>eats too much salt and the blood pressure raises..felt it beating
hard and</b>
<br><b>then it happened............we had left the chandelier on but above
us the</b>
<br><b>light surged a glow that was way beyond light bulbs, and as it surged
( I</b>
<br><b>would say 6 time) it gave a vibrating hum.&nbsp; You have to understand
we did</b>
<br><b>not look, we did not acknowledge to each other....this was about</b>
<br><b>1:30A..............then i awoke about 5:00 ...i was on my back opened
my</b>
<br><b>eyes and looking at the chandelier...................Susan was up
and</b>
<br><b>packing...she was ready to leave....I told her breakfast was not
til 8,</b>
<br><b>there was a calm now no nervous...we were in stealth mode.....but
i got up and</b>
<br><b>began to pack myself and got dressed..then susan said she had a
dream</b>
<br><b>about a meeting....and I remembered I had a dream about a meeting,
i was in charge</b>
<br><b>and I had a plan with another man (another man, i am a woman) and
very</b>
<br><b>important in the dining room ........Susan dreamed she was observing
this</b>
<br><b>meeting and had no part in it.....................(The Master andChloe)</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; We went to breakfast and again i was in a rather trance......we
met the</b>
<br><b>other couple and after polite introductions, they explained that
they did</b>
<br><b>not have dinner at the carriage house, they arrived at 9pm..................we</b>
<br><b>heard them at 5.</b>
<br><b>they had not taken the tour so did not know the stories.....they
heard</b>
<br><b>what sounded like bowling balls in the parlor area..........( that
is where</b>
<br><b>they say you can hear furniture being moved.) and then i explained
about my</b>
<br><b>racing heart and they astounded each other by saying it happened
to them,</b>
<br><b>too....had not told each other.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; We left that morning after taking pictures..we live in Texas
and it was</b>
<br><b>not until halfway back.........I said, maybe this was my imagination,
but i</b>
<br><b>think that light........ Susan finished the sentence "got brighter".......we
both screamed and got chills and were totally terrified in the car..........she
heard the hum.</b>
<br><b>Our question is .........what happened those 3 missing hours...i
dont</b>
<br><b>think we were asleep.</b><b></b>

<br><b>My Friends Grandpa</b><b></b>

<p><b>Not to exciting but this is an encounter I had and I choose not to
believe in the supernatural as I get freaked out easily but after reading
this page I feel more comfortable.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>I was over at my friends house one night and we were getting ready
to go out and she always talks about her grandpa who had died of alcoholism
and she also drinks very heavily and one night while she was upstairs (this
is a townhouse and you can stand in the kitchen and see into the bathroom
mirror) so I was standing in the kitchen to see how I looked and then all
of a sudden it got cold and I could see in the mirror an older man and
he looked just like her grandpa (I had seen pictures of him) and he stood
there for a moment behind me and then when I turned around he was gone.&nbsp;
Of course I screamed and did not tell my friend what happened thinking
I had one to many cocktails but to this day I believe it was her grandpa.&nbsp;&nbsp;
My mom has seen and talked to ghosts ever since she was a little girl and
she said I used to have a spirit that watched over me as a child when we
lived in this one house.</b>

<p><b>It started the night of labor day.&nbsp; We'd lived here almost a
year with only one minimal occurance.&nbsp; That occurance was when my
husband fell asleep in his armcahair downstairs and was awakened by someone
tapping his arm and telling him to go to bed.&nbsp; He asked me when he
got to bed if I had done it, which I hadn't.</b>
<br><b>On the night of labor day I awakened several times in the night
to the sound of someone running up my stairs in hard soled shoes. Not down
only up. Each time this would be about to occur my cats who sleep on me
jumped up and looked and my doorway for a moment then scatter in different
directions.&nbsp; I didn't pay to much attention to it until my alarm went
off at 5:40am. I lay awake tring to get up when it did it twice again.&nbsp;
Then two weeks later my 14 year old daughter woke me up telling me that
she was hearing it.&nbsp; I got up to investigate.&nbsp; She told me that
my cordless phone which she had hung up in my room before going to bed
was back in her room beeping like someone was hitting page find. And it
was because it was still doing it when I went to her room.&nbsp; I took
the phone and put it back in my room, I had found it in the corner of her
room under her vanity.&nbsp; Then I put her to bed in my sons room.&nbsp;
The next morning when we got up I went to shut off the hall light and noticed
that her vanity seat was riped apart. The wooden frame was torn off and
so were the legs.&nbsp; There was still particles of wood under the screws.&nbsp;
Nothing had happened since then until sunday Nov. 26th.&nbsp; My son had
stayed all night with my mom and my daughter had stayed all night with
a friend.&nbsp; She got home the next morning first and found her glasses
broke intwo at the nose piece.</b>

<p><b>USS Sulivans</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Hunter0768@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;I live just outside Buffalo, New York. I had always wanted
to visit a</b>
<br><b>small inactice militay naval yard. One day, my girlfriend at the
time and myself</b>
<br><b>decided to visit. The ship we wanted to visit the most was called
the USS</b>
<br><b>Sullivans because it was haunted. The ship was named after 5 Sullivan</b>
<br><b>brothers. The ship is haunted by George Sullivan who died in action
and</b>
<br><b>was unfortunately left to die when his ship he was on was hit by
a torpedo. My</b>
<br><b>girlfriend at the time and myself were the only two people on the</b>
<br><b>ship...in the park at that. The only other people were workers.
One at the building</b>
<br><b>where you first enter to pay and the other was a woman at the gift
shop.</b>
<br><b>We were looking around on the boat and came across an unlocked room.
It was</b>
<br><b>the stragedies room. Perhaps another 15 minutes went by when we
came across</b>
<br><b>another unlocked room. This room was the captains room. It contained</b>
<br><b>documents about who was working what position and when while the
ship was</b>
<br><b>in service. We were thumbing through these books when all of a sudden
I heard</b>
<br><b>"psssst!!" right over my right shoulder. We put the books back and
looked</b>
<br><b>in the hall and there was nobody to be seen. It didn't spook us
too much but</b>
<br><b>we didn't stick around too much longer. After we got off of the
ship we went</b>
<br><b>into the gift shop and talked to an older woman working in there.
I asked</b>
<br><b>her about hauntings on the ship and she said that the most activity
happens on</b>
<br><b>any Friday the 13th. She also said that overnight security is constantly</b>
<br><b>relocking doors on the boat the the had just locked an hour before.
She</b>
<br><b>said that they will hear chains and yelling all the time coming
from the boat</b>
<br><b>and that the overnight security guards usually don't last too long
there! I</b>
<br><b>can't wait to go back there on a Friday the 13th!</b>

<p><b>Beautiful Ghost Story</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Elannah</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;One day while I was living in Southern Japan, I got to attend
the funeral</b>
<br><b>of a friend's mother. On the night of the funeral after I had changed
my</b>
<br><b>clothes, and she was cremated earlier that day, my boyfriend (soon
to be</b>
<br><b>husband) and I were sitting in our living room enjoying some quiet
time</b>
<br><b>together. We both looked at the window and smelled the strong scent
of</b>
<br><b>incense. No one really knew why but all of a sudden we felt the
old</b>
<br><b>woman's presence in the room for that instance. And then it was
gone.</b>
<br><b>I spoke to the family the following day to tell them the experience
we had</b>
<br><b>both had that night and they told me oh she slept in her own bed
last</b>
<br><b>night as the family had heard her own toilet flush in the night.
No one wanted</b>
<br><b>to go near that room for a long time, therefore no one would have
used that</b>
<br><b>bathroom that night. Seems that she wasn't ready to leave this world.
It</b>
<br><b>is Japanese custom to bring home the dead body once creamated for
49 days</b>
<br><b>(four is a homonym for death and nine is a homonym for pain and
suffering). So</b>
<br><b>they would have kept her body at home for that period of time and
everyday</b>
<br><b>the told me they could feel her presence until the 50th day when
she went</b>
<br><b>to the family plot. Every year the people in the country celebrate
the dead,</b>
<br><b>newly and ancient. They prepare a feast of the person's favorite
foods as</b>
<br><b>well as offering to God, Buddah. Then a priest makes a visit and
prayers</b>
<br><b>are said for all the dead relatives. This goes on for three days
and then the</b>
<br><b>family takes the spirits back to the cemetary and says we will await
your</b>
<br><b>arrival next summer. Everyone in Japan understands the season of
the dead</b>
<br><b>known in Japanese as Obon. The first season after a family member
has died</b>
<br><b>is especially important. The family must display a huge feast (bigger
than</b>
<br><b>normal), display brightly lit lanterns in a room and have more offerings</b>
<br><b>for the gods prepared. On the 14th of August, day three of the celebration,</b>
<br><b>the family burns the lanterns as they are made of rice paper and
the spirits</b>
<br><b>are set free.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Ghost in Our House (or I guess we are in the ghost's house)</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: david mccoy</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>The house I live in once belonged to the grandparents of my stepfather.&nbsp;
His mother's name is Jayne and she had an identical twin sister named Jean.
Jean died long before I was a part of this family, so I never met her.
The house is a big two-story Victorian style house. We used Jean's original
bedroom as a guest room.&nbsp; There were many times that my husband and
I would be downstairs and we would hear noises coming from the direction
of that room: door shutting, banging, etc. We had two small dogs that would
not even go in that room; they would stand at the door and whimper.</b>
<br><b>Jayne lived with my parents during the time my first daughter was
born, and my mother took care of my daughter while I worked from the time
she was 6 months old until she was one, so she knew Jayne as Nana Jayne.
When my daughter was about a year and a half old, I moved her from the
nursery to Jean's old room. One day we were sitting on her bed putting
her shoes on and she looked straight at the doorway and said, "Hi. Hi,
Nana Jayne."&nbsp; I looked up and there was nothing there.&nbsp; If she
had seen Jean, she would assume it was Jayne since they were identical
twins.</b>
<br><b>There were several times when she was a baby that I would wake up
and the baby monitor would be turned off.&nbsp; It was usually when I had
been extremely exhausted and we think maybe Jean turned it off and was
watching over her so I could rest.&nbsp; We also would hear things over
the monitor and when we would go in the nursery to see what it was, there
was never anything out of the ordinary.&nbsp; We think that Jean still
lives there and that she watches over us.&nbsp; Sometimes if we're in one
of the upstairs rooms, there will be movement out on the landing like someone
walking around, but you always see it out of your side vision and there's
never anything there, although you could swear you saw someone walk by.</b><b></b>

<br><b>ALVIN - The Upstairs Ghost</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: angler@kwic.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Since my (not using real names here) Aunt "Belinda" lives on the</b>
<br><b>family farm, and my Mom works on that farm, I go to her</b>
<br><b>house at least once a week, sometimes twice.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Half of my Aunt's house is over 100 years old, while the other</b>
<br><b>part, which was added on to the old part by my Grandpa is new.</b>
<br><b>The house has been renevated or has undergone important changes</b>
<br><b>at least six times (and these are only counting the ones that I</b>
<br><b>am aware of).</b><b></b>
<p><b>About 3 weeks back, every time I would go upstairs (the oldest</b>
<br><b>part of the house) I would get the feeling that something was</b>
<br><b>telling me to get out, and go back downstairs. To stay away from</b>
<br><b>the entire upstairs area. After a couple days, the feeling</b>
<br><b>became a bit stronger, and I was too frightened to go upstairs</b>
<br><b>at all- so I didn't. I could only make it half way up the</b>
<br><b>stairs, and I couldn't bring myself to go any further.</b><b></b>
<p><b>I was positive that it was a spirit, perhaps the spirit of my</b>
<br><b>Grandpa, or of his son Alvin, who was killed by being hit by a</b>
<br><b>car on the road infront of the house.</b><b></b>
<p><b>One night, I went downstairs where my cousin "Ann" was</b>
<br><b>downstairs with the CD player on really loud. I went down to</b>
<br><b>turn the volume down, but when I was halfway into the room I</b>
<br><b>heard something in the furnace room fall. I asked Ann if she had
been</b>
<br><b>in that room, and she said no. Then I hadthe same feeling that I
had</b>
<br><b>been getting upstairs except much MUCH stronger. It only lasted
1</b>
<br><b>second (maybe not even that) but</b>
<br><b>it was very strong, and I'll never forget it. I felt like the</b>
<br><b>spirit (if there was one) was telling me to get out (this time,</b>
<br><b>out of the basement). I felt like it was right next to me- too</b>
<br><b>close. I ran upstairs (since I was in the basement, upstairs</b>
<br><b>this time is the main level of the house) and the feeling was</b>
<br><b>gone.</b><b></b>
<p><b>The next day I made my Aunt borrow my dream/spirit catcher, and hung
it</b>
<br><b>up in my kitchen. Even though I was he only one that had the</b>
<br><b>feelings, and she thought that I was kidding about the ghost,</b>
<br><b>she let me put it up. I hung it from her kitchen light, above</b>
<br><b>the kitchen table.</b><b></b>
<p><b>After only one day of it hanging up, I felt like the spirit was</b>
<br><b>gone, and I still do. So I took it down. However, that same day</b>
<br><b>I found something that resembled the word "Alvin" scratched into
the</b>
<br><b>under side of the railing of the stairs that goes to the top level</b>
<br><b>(where I had the feelings). The feeling was -and still is-</b>
<br><b>practiclly gone, but I was I little spooked about seeing the</b>
<br><b>name Alvin- the son of my Grandpa, who had been hit by a car and</b>
<br><b>died- sketched into the railing of the upstairs- where I had the</b>
<br><b>feelings.</b><b></b>
<p><b>(years ago, when my Mom lived in that house, she thouse she</b>
<br><b>heard someone whisper her name when she was in bed. She says she</b>
<br><b>can't remember whether it was before or after Alvin's death, but</b>
<br><b>it's still spooky)</b>
