<P><B>I don't what it is but in my house weird things happen.Like this clock
the </B>
<P><B>part that swings got broke like 7 or 8 years ago then when I was getting
</B>
<P><B>close to my graduation we had one of those hat we wear for graduation
and </B>
<P><B>put it by the clock and the arm started to swing and my mom tells me
its my </B>
<P><B>great grandmother who passed away about 5 years ago is the reason it
started to </B>
<P><B>swing. Now i don't know if its true I want to think that but I'm not
sure what </B>
<P><B>to make out of it.</B>

<P><B>By: Anonymous</B>
<P><B>I have an eerie story to tell. I don't </B>
<P><B>want my name posted, because I would prefer not to.&amp;nbsp; Maybe
in 1988 or 89 (I </B>
<P><B>was probably 15-16 at the time) I went to a party at one of my girlfriend's
</B>
<P><B>homes in my hometown, a western suburb of Chicago. I still remember
this </B>
<P><B>rather vividly. Let me start off that I had not been feeling well,
so I had not </B>
<P><B>drank any alcohol, smoked anything illegal, or been around anyone who
was </B>
<P><B>smoking, so it cannot even be written off as a residual high. Late
in the </B>
<P><B>evening everyone was getting tired, so we started looking for a place
to </B>
<P><B>crash. The girl who's house it was, Marie, another friend of ours,
and I </B>
<P><B>all lay down in Marie's room in her large bed. Our friend lay against
the </B>
<P><B>wall, with Marie in the center, and I was on the outside edge. I had
</B>
<P><B>trouble sleeping, and facing outward, closed my eyes. It seemed like
</B>
<P><B>almost immediately, I felt almost a cold light breeze hit my face.
I </B>
<P><B>opened my eyes, and there was a man standing directly in front of me.
I </B>
<P><B>remember he had very pretty hands, because they were nearest to my
face, they </B>
<P><B>reminded me of doves for some strange reason, very thin and long and
fair </B>
<P><B>complected. He was wearing all dark clothing, seemed like a long either
</B>
<P><B>trench coat or a duster, and a dark hat. I don't remember the type
of hat, </B>
<P><B>but the brim seemed not as rigid as that of a top hat, more like a
hat that was </B>
<P><B>popular during the Al Capone era (I was looking up.). His face was
very </B>
<P><B>non-descript, I remember only very fair skin and piercing black eyes,
like those </B>
<P><B>of a bird. I jumped back and almost crushed my friends together. </B>
<P><B>When Marie asked what was wrong, I told her nothing, thinking I must
have been </B>
<P><B>crazy, and tried to go back to bed. The rest of the night was </B>
<P><B>uneventful. The next morning, Marie asked me again why I had jumped.</B>
<P><B>I told her that I thought I had seen something, and she pressed me
for </B>
<P><B>what. I told her then about the man and her face paled. It seemed </B>
<P><B>that a short time before, another couple of her friends had been sitting
on her </B>
<P><B>rooftop, drinking beer, and had described seeing the same man walk
across the </B>
<P><B>top of the roof and step off the edge. They said when they looked down,
</B>
<P><B>there was no one there, but she had written it off as drunkenness.
I then </B>
<P><B>became convinced that I had seen a ghost. I have lost touch with her
and </B>
<P><B>her family moved out of the house shortly after, so I am unsure if
there have </B>
<P><B>been any more sightings.</B>

<P><B>Two Experiences</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: gryan@cancom.net</B>
<P><B>Hello, I`m an eleven-year-old girl and my sister and I would </B>
<P><B>like to share our experiances. They are not very serious experiances,but
they deserve some </B>
<P><B>credit.Here is my, CalvinKlein_97`s experiance,one stary night I saw
some airplanes in the sky, so I went </B>
<P><B>downstairs to hang up my winter clothes (it was winter) I heard my
dad shout out </B>
<P><B>my name and whistle, but my dad was at work that night, then about
a week later, </B>
<P><B>I saw my cat in the bathroom and in my room at the same time! (my room
is right </B>
<P><B>next to the bathroom. At night, sometimes I`ll look up to my window
and I`ll see a </B>
<P><B>faint silhouette of a human figure and feel like something is watching
me,but </B>
<P><B>noone will&amp;nbsp; be there.Here is my , Screwdle_Noodle2`s
experiance,</B>
<P><B>I`m thirteen-years-old and am pretty smart. I skipped a grade </B>
<P><B>and have recently graduated grade eight. I will be going into high-school
this </B>
<P><B>fall. My sister and I live in an average-sized house that is fairly
new. </B>
<P><B>Although I have the brains in my family (I have three sisters and two
</B>
<P><B>parents) I can`t seem to avoid trouble. I`m sent to my room almost
on a daily </B>
<P><B>basis and have spent hours alone there with the door shut all by myself.
My bed </B>
<P><B>is right across from my door and my closet is in the far top left corner
</B>
<P><B>from my bed. I have come to hate my closet and fear it! It is the kind
of closet </B>
<P><B>that has two doors that slide from side to side and it doesn`t close
all the </B>
<P><B>way. ONLY at night it will regularly creek FOR NO REASON and it is
not a soft, </B>
<P><B>quiet creek. It is loud and can even wake heavy sleepers like me. I
always think </B>
<P><B>that something is IN my closet or likes to make it creek. I`ve never
seen </B>
<P><B>anything come or go into my closet, but I get REALLY BAD VIBES from
</B>
<P><B>it. I`m an unofficial insomniac and have mager trouble sleeping </B>
<P><B>and 9 out of 10 nights will wake uo in the middle of the night and
look out my </B>
<P><B>door and into the hall (I ALWAYS keep my door open.) and have the feeling
that </B>
<P><B>something is going to come down the hall and get me! I`ve never seen
anything </B>
<P><B>come down the hall, but when I don`t wake up in the middle of the night,
MY door </B>
<P><B>is mysteriously shut tight.The last thing I will say is that I sometimes
have really </B>
<P><B>weird dreams. Like once, I was 12 at the time and dream that I was
a little girl </B>
<P><B>about 7, or 8 years old, she had light brown hair and a night gown
on I`d </B>
<P><B>never seen before. She had a face that wasn`t mine when I was her age
and I </B>
<P><B>think maybe green or blue eyes or maybe the same color as mine (mine
are hazel). </B>
<P><B>My bed faced the window and I, the little girl, was sleeping on my
back(I always </B>
<P><B>sleep on my stomach) and I suddenly woke up for no reason. Some one,I
think it </B>
<P><B>was my mom, was in the kitchen and the light from the kitchen lit up
my room a </B>
<P><B>bit so it was only partially dark.I suddenly woke up and looked straight
up and out my </B>
<P><B>window. I have this dog, a husky/sheperd mix and a dog just like him
came </B>
<P><B>through the window! It was see-through whitish and was NOT my dog!
MY dog looks </B>
<P><B>ALOT like a wolf, everybody says so, but the dog that floated through
my window </B>
<P><B>was EVIL and I think actually WAS a wolf! I don`t even think it was
my room, It </B>
<P><B>was more like a room I had when I was younger in the same house.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Similiar Experience</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: psaylor@nilfisk-advance.com</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>When I read what happened to you, all the hairs went up on the back
of</B>
<P><B>my neck. You see, I too was visited by a stranger in the night when
I</B>
<P><B>was young. And just like you, it looked like a little person with a
big,</B>
<P><B>swollen head. </B>
<P><B>One night when I was about twelve or so, I woke to the feeling of</B>
<P><B>someone watching me. The first thing that I thought was that it was
my</B>
<P><B>twin brother Paul. Paul used to sleepwalk and sometimes I would find
him</B>
<P><B>in my room. Now, waking up to ANYONE standing by your bed staring at
you</B>
<P><B>is frightening in itself, but when your brother does it all the time
in</B>
<P><B>his sleep, you kind of get used to it.</B>
<P><B>Anyway, I woke up in total blackness to the feeling that someone was</B>
<P><B>staring at me from the corner of the room. When I sat up and adjusted
my</B>
<P><B>eyes, I could make out a slight figure standing in the corner. I said</B>
<P><B>"Paul, go back to bed!" But the visitor was *not* my brother, after
all.</B>
<P><B>It slowly moved to the foot of my bed, and in one quick movement
jumped</B>
<P><B>up on the bed and sat on my chest! It was a horrible looking thing,
with</B>
<P><B>a small, baby-like body with a big, unnatural-sized bald head. The
face</B>
<P><B>was distorted - I can't quite explain it, but the features weren't</B>
<P><B>right. Almost like it was trying to look human, but wasn't quite
getting</B>
<P><B>it right. It was clearly female, and it started talking to me. I was
so</B>
<P><B>scared I tried to jump out of my bed, but I couldn't move. I don't
know</B>
<P><B>if that's because if this *thing* or because I was so frightened.
It's</B>
<P><B>lips were moving, but I couldn't understand what it was trying to
say.</B>
<P><B>Even though it was small, the gibberish coming out of it's mouth was</B>
<P><B>very deep and resonating. Anyway, the only other things I remember
of</B>
<P><B>that night was a blue light coming from my window by my bed as it sat
on</B>
<P><B>me. I DO remember at some later time in the night running to the
kitchen</B>
<P><B>and writing down my experience on paper. </B>
<P>
<P><B>The next morning I was apparently the first up, so I ran to the
kitchen</B>
<P><B>to the spot where I hid the papers (ten pages in all I remember - so
a</B>
<P><B>lot more must of happened that I don't remember) and they were gone!
I</B>
<P><B>asked everyone if they've seen them, but to this day either my
parents</B>
<P><B>are lying to me (which IS possible, they are devout Christians and
maybe</B>
<P><B>they thought it best to dispose of them) But I can't understand to
this</B>
<P><B>day what they would be doing digging around where I hid the papers</B>
<P><B>before six in the morning.</B>
<P>
<P><B>After this event I became more and more interested in trying to find
out</B>
<P><B>what it was that came to me that night. I knew it wasn't a dream
because</B>
<P><B>dreams fade. I was never so sure of anything in my life as this event</B>
<P><B>was to me. So by the age of sixteen I decided to make my own weijie</B>
<P><B>board to try to communicate with whatever it was that might be there</B>
<P><B>lurking in my house. This I would later reflect on was a VERY bad
idea.</B>
<P><B>Immediately things started happening to me. First, the swollen headed</B>
<P><B>creature returned to me, but it was getting more sinister. It's face</B>
<P><B>would take the face of people I knew. First it took the face of my</B>
<P><B>girlfriend Lisa, then other people in my family and occasionally it</B>
<P><B>would appear as itself. Every time was the events were the same - I'd</B>
<P><B>wake up with a creepy feeling that I was being watched, suddenly the</B>
<P><B>thing would jump on my bed and pin me down, I'd see a blue light from</B>
<P><B>somewhere, and then I would awaken scared to death.</B>
<P><B>I decided to get my friends involved. One of them named Frank was</B>
<P><B>delving into meditation and out-of-body experiences and such, so I
asked</B>
<P><B>him to come over. Immediately things started going from bad to worse.</B>
<P><B>When we used the board, we contacted *something* right away. It said
it</B>
<P><B>was the spirit of my dead grandfather. I told it to show itself, and
it</B>
<P><B>spelled out "look behind you". I turned, and my cat was there,
staring</B>
<P><B>at me - swaying back and forth. It was the creepiest thing. It had
a</B>
<P><B>dead look in it's eyes. I know how hard this must be to digest, but
I</B>
<P><B>got the feeling *something* was inhabiting my cat at that time. After</B>
<P><B>several attempts to "shew" the cat away, I finally picked up the
board</B>
<P><B>and threw it against the wall. The cat then seemed to come to it's</B>
<P><B>senses and ran back upstairs.</B>
<P><B>Frank and I grabbed the board again and told it to stop scaring us.
We</B>
<P><B>asked it a lot of questions, and it always gave an answer. It would
also</B>
<P><B>perform tricks for us. Like spelling out "lights" and then the lights</B>
<P><B>would go out for a couple of seconds and then come on. It would spell</B>
<P><B>out "phone" and the phone would ring just once. We played around with
it</B>
<P><B>for about a week or so.</B>
<P>
<P><B>One night when my parents were away we decided to move to the next
level</B>
<P><B>and have a s&eacute;ance in my kitchen. We turned all the lights out
and lit a</B>
<P><B>black candle and placed it in the center of the table. We then joined</B>
<P><B>hands and started chanting "spirit, come. Spirit, come." Suddenly,
a</B>
<P><B>&gt;moth flew out of nowhere and dove right into the candle flame,
killing</B>
<P><B>itself! That's the last thing I remember, because something very
bizarre</B>
<P><B>happened next which I don't remember, but my friends will definitely
not</B>
<P><B>forget. </B>
<P>
<P><B>After seeing the moth burn up, my next recollection is lying on the</B>
<P><B>couch in my living room with all my friends standing around me
looking</B>
<P><B>down at me. I asked them what was wrong, and they told me that right</B>
<P><B>after the moth burned up they watched my eyes roll into the back of
my</B>
<P><B>head, my head went back and I screamed something in a different
language</B>
<P><B>and then I collapsed. They then moved me over to the couch, where I
laid</B>
<P><B>for about five minutes before I woke.</B>
<P><B>Right after this happened, Frank was still muttering the phrase I</B>
<P><B>blurted out over and over to himself, trying to figure out where he</B>
<P><B>heard that phrase before. Suddenly he ran out to his car and grabbed
a</B>
<P><B>black book and brought it into the living room. He told us it was the</B>
<P><B>satanic bible. I immediately told him to get it the hell out of my
house</B>
<P><B>(after all I *was* raised in a Christian home). He turned to the back
of</B>
<P><B>the book feverishly scanning the pages and then said "Oh my God...".
We</B>
<P><B>all were looking at him when he raised his head and quoted the phrase
I</B>
<P><B>blurted out, apparently reading it right out of the book! According
to</B>
<P><B>the satanic bible, it was an ancient Sanskrit language that I spoke,
and</B>
<P><B>the phrase I spoke was translated to say "In the name of Satan, I</B>
<P><B>leave!"</B>
<P>
<P><B>After that event, we stopped playing around - but whatever was in my</B>
<P><B>house , although no longer appearing in physical form, was still
messing</B>
<P><B>around with me. One night I was home alone, talking to my girlfriend</B>
<P><B>Lisa on the phone, when I heard footsteps on our basement staircase.
The</B>
<P><B>staircase squeaked something awful whenever anyone went up or down
it,</B>
<P><B>so I knew someone was on the stairs. I told Lisa to hold on and
walked</B>
<P><B>to the top of the staircase, looking down into the basement and saw</B>
<P><B>noone. But slowly, the steps were creaking closer and closer up to
me,</B>
<P><B>as if someone WAS walking up them. I was scared silly. When it
reached</B>
<P><B>the top of the stairs, the creaking stopped and then suddenly started</B>
<P><B>again, but this time down my hallway and into my bedroom. I hung up
the</B>
<P><B>phone and ran outside, where my parents found me three hours later
when</B>
<P><B>they came home. It was cold out there - only in the 40's, but better
to</B>
<P><B>be cold outside then to be warm and freaked-out inside. I told them
I</B>
<P><B>locked myself out - which didn't make any sense, because my father</B>
<P><B>walked right up to the door and it was not locked. But to this day
they</B>
<P><B>don't ask me why I was really outside.</B>
<P>
<P><B>After this I began to pray to God to rid my house of this evil. I
began</B>
<P><B>to go back to church, much to the chagrin of my friends, and it</B>
<P><B>eventually went away.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Years later, I was talking to my twin brother about some of the
things</B>
<P><B>we did together those nights, like hide things in one room, run to
the</B>
<P><B>basement and tell the board to move the item, run back upstairs and
the</B>
<P><B>item was gone - only to reappear later in strange places. We talked</B>
<P><B>about the night we were about nine years old and walked into our dark</B>
<P><B>bedroom in the middle of a thunderstorm to find a huge, cat-like face</B>
<P><B>staring at us through our window (he remembered THAT quite clearly)
and</B>
<P><B>many other strange events.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I don't like to talk about them anymore, because I guess I'm afraid
that</B>
<P><B>talking about it will bring it back.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Anyway, I thought you should know that you're not alone in some of
the</B>
<P><B>details of your tale.</B>

<P><B>Old Air Force Base</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: dowell_69@yahoo.com</B>
<P>
<P><B> Hi, my name is Sandy and I live in an old air force base in
Ontario.We</B>
<P><B>live in townhouses that where once family quarters.At one point we</B>
<P><B>lived in #12 which is where my experiences happened.There was several</B>
<P><B>times that different things would happen, like the toilet flushing
on</B>
<P><B>it's own or the taps coming on by themselves.One night I was kissing
my</B>
<P><B>husband good-night and I looked down toward the end of our bed,</B>
<P><B>standing there was a black man dressed like he had been out in the</B>
<P><B>fields many years ago.I wasn't quite sure what to do so I just went
to</B>
<P><B>sleep.Alot of the time in the house I'd catch someone out of the
corner</B>
<P><B>of my eye but when I turned to look at them, they'd be gone.My young</B>
<P><B>daughter complained about a man with big teeth, that dressed in jeans</B>
<P><B>and a t-shirt.When we moved from the unit she never mentioned him</B>
<P><B>again.I figure he was the one that wouldn't let me see him.</B>
<P>
<P><B>A Simple Hello</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: pamela@ees.eesc.com</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B> I have encountered very strange things in </B>
<P><B>my home. I will keep it simple, The one most frightening experience
I've </B>
<P><B>had was brief, but terrifying. My daughter was about maybe 4 months
</B>
<P><B>old. I was awake in our bedroom which is next to our daughters room,
It </B>
<P><B>was approx. 2 or 3 am, I couldnt sleep for some reason. My daughter
</B>
<P><B>started crying real loud  I went to check on her when I entered the
doorway </B>
<P><B>of her room I was greeted with Hello that was all it said. It was </B>
<P><B>off to the left of me and I could feel it. (My daughters crib was on
that side </B>
<P><B>of the wall) I heard it  I felt it. I was not in a slumber,I was wide
</B>
<P><B>awake. As I entered the Hello was eerie as hell. It was </B>
<P><B>a mans voice, it was a familiar voice but I could not place it, it
was also </B>
<P><B>friendly but freaky. I pretended none of this happened.(imagine </B>
<P><B>that). I WAS FREAKED OUT !!! I picked up my screaming baby with all
the </B>
<P><B>hair on my body raised acting like nothing happened, walked her down
the hallway </B>
<P><B> sat in a chair comforting her. I had full view of the hallway with
</B>
<P><B>the light on of course, still freaked out but comforting my baby. Nothing
</B>
<P><B>happened after that but what I had encountered that night still affects
</B>
<P><B>me. It was just a hello, but a damn frightening hello, I still </B>
<P><B>remember the tone of the voice, familiar, friendly  </B>
<P><B>terrifying.</B>
<P>
<P><B>New Hampshire</B>
<P><B>					</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: Tlwtn@aol.com</B>
<P><B> 			</B>
<P><B>I grew up in an old victorian house in Dover, New Hampshire. I lived
there </B>
<P><B>from 1966 to 1981 at which time I left home to pursue my career. My
family </B>
<P><B>owned the house for a few more years and eventually sold it {I believe
in </B>
<P><B>1984.} During the years I lived in that house I had some experiences
which </B>
<P><B>still trouble me. I wonder often if the present inhabitants have been
as </B>
<P><B>uncomfortable as I was there.					I was three </B>
<P><B>years old when we moved into the house at 4 hough St. I am the sixth
of seven </B>
<P><B>children and we all took rooms on the second floor. The oldest kids
got the </B>
<P><B>bigger rooms and the younger kids crowded together in the smaller ones.
As we </B>
<P><B>grew up the older kids married and moved out and the younger ones graduated
</B>
<P><B>to better bedrooms. For many years I experienced an uncomfortable feeling
in </B>
<P><B>various parts of the house and avoided them. The basement stands in
my memory </B>
<P><B>as a particularly disquieting place. When I was about thirteen I moved
into a </B>
<P><B>room that had been used by two of my sisters before me. It was at this
time </B>
<P><B>that I became truely frightened of the house. 					</B>
<P><B>									Let </B>
<P><B>me preface this by saying that my sisters never felt uncomfortable
in this </B>
<P><B>room. I have questioned them both and they have no idea what I am refering
</B>
<P><B>to. Neither do any of my other six brothers or sisters have any similar
</B>
<P><B>stories.				One day after I had moved into what </B>
<P><B>had been my sister's room I went to an unoccupied space in the attic
and sat </B>
<P><B>in the closet. I felt like I had "glossed over," that I wasn't unconcious
but </B>
<P><B>not completely in touch with what I was doing. In the dark I began
feeling </B>
<P><B>the texture of the walls. I dug with my fingers into the plaster until
I </B>
<P><B>found an arrowhead buried about two inches deep. I suddenly realized
that I </B>
<P><B>was sitting in a closet doing something odd and ran back downstairs.	
</B>
<P><B>			Aside from this, on many occassions I felt that </B>
<P><B>someone was with me in that bedroom. I began waking in the middle of
the </B>
<P><B>night certain that someone was watching me. Eventually I would wake
up </B>
<P><B>feeling that I was parylized and that something was smothering me.
I was </B>
<P><B>afraid to even go to sleep. I kept the lights on all night. After some
months </B>
<P><B>it became too frightening and I moved to another room. I tried to avoid
going </B>
<P><B>into that room after that and to avoid the parts of the house that
I had </B>
<P><B>found to be hot spots." I lived in that house until I graduated from
high </B>
<P><B>school and then moved south to Massachussettes.					</B>
<P><B>						I do not discount the </B>
<P><B>possibility that I may have imagined this. I think it would be easier
to </B>
<P><B>believe that I was crazy. But if anyone has lived in this houseand
had a </B>
<P><B>similar experience I would love to talk to them. 				</B>
<P><B>						I don't know what I am </B>
<P><B>expecting from this. I am 36 years old and I haven't lived in New Hampshire
</B>
