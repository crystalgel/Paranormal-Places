<p><b>Ghost Story</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: theblondey@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I've always been one to believe in ghosts and spirits...both good
and bad. I'm thankful that I've never had a really scarey experience but
I have had a few 'wierd' experiences and one some what scary experience.</b>
<br><b>I'll start with my odd, unexplainable experiences. When I was younger
and living w/ my parents I used to have to do chores around the house.
Now it's important to know that my parents house was previously occupied
by my grandmother who died in the early 90's. One day while I was dusting
the mantal over the fire place I was dusting one end and something on the
other end fell off. It was ceramic but it landed on the carpet so it didn't
break. I didn't think anything of this other than the mantal must have
been slick from the dust polish. I was just happy the nicknack didn't break.
The following week the same exact thing happened, only this time the ceramic
nicknack hit the brick part of the fire place then bounced on to the carpet..even
though it hit brick, pretty hard too, it didn't break. I thought this was
odd but just chalked it up to luck. The following week two things fell
off the mantal, before I had polished that side, both hit the brick and
bounced and neither broke. I just got the feeling my grandma was haunting
me a little. Over the years several things fell off that mantal but never
broke.</b>
<br><b>Now I'll tell about the scarey one. When I was 16 I had a boyfriend
that stayed w/ some friends of his b/c he didn't get along w/ his dad.
He and his friends always told me these stories about the house. Apparently
the house had been built on the old site of the county court house. The
mother of his friend told me how she walked into the living room and in
the hall way she saw stairs w/ people walking up and down them...kind of
transparent like. They all revealed stories of how the sterio would turn
on as loud as possible in the middle of the night and all three bedroom
doors would open at once when everyone ran out to see who turned on the
radio. I thought all these stories were cool but for a house that was so
haunted I wondered why I never experienced anything. They all said the
ghosts were shy and wouldn't present themselves to new people. Well after
about 6 months I started to not believe b/c I still had no experiences.
Then one day I had my experience. My boyfriend and I were sitting down
stairs. The house was split level. The floor above this room was hardwood.
The stairs coming down were carpeted. They came about half way down, then
there was a landing and then the stair case turned and came the rest of
the way down. Well, we were the only two home. They had two dogs, one dog
was at my feet and the other was right outside the door taking a nap in
the sun. I was getting ready to leave but I had decided to stay for another
20 minutes or so. All of a sudden I heard loud footsteps come across the
floor upstairs and walk down the first set of stairs and stop at the landing.
No one was there. The dog at my feet stood up and looked and all the hair
stood up on her back. I decided that was my cue to leave. What was so scarey
was that the foot steps sounded angry. You know, like someone was stomping
across the floor. I went over several more times and never had another
experience but that one experience was enough to make me believe w/out
a doubt. I hope you use this story...I know it's not the scariest or the
oddest...but it's true none the less</b>

<p><b>Sensitive</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: wild_flower_river@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Well, I've always been a bit sensetive to the supernatural. I am
17 years old.&nbsp; As a child I used to see things, people walking in
rooms, but when I'd go and look in them, no one was there.&nbsp; Well,
it was late last year, and I was asleep. I remember waking up, but still
being asleep and calling for my mom and waking her up. I told her there
was a ghost in my closet that wouldn't leave me alone.&nbsp; I asked my
mom if you ask a ghost to leave you alone or if you tell it to leave you
alone.&nbsp; I remember her getting a little shook up and she told me to
tell the ghost to just go away. I remember the most clearly saying, Go
AWAY, and then falling back to sleep.&nbsp; The next day my mom was visiting
with our neighbor and he told her that his wife had died that night...the
same I night I told the ghost to leave.&nbsp; I just thought I'd tell my
story, because maybe others will find it interesting, or have similliar
experiences. Don't laugh, or think I'm crazy or anything, please, because
what I'm telling you is the honest truth.&nbsp; Thank you very much.</b>

<p><b>The Bathroom Door</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: iamiib@msn.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Let me start buy saying that read this sight quite frequently and
I am a firm believer in "strange happenings". I have only had one occurance
in my life and it is the one I am about to share. Let me just say for the
record that I am 23 years old and this story happened about 9 years ago
so I was of an age to remember what happened clearly. My family lived in
a house that was rather old, I mean it had a dirt basement with no light.
We lived in this house until I was 14. Well when I was little I had an
over-riding fear of the dark, and this house always made it worse for some
reason that I couldn't figure out. I didnt like to be alone at anytime
in this house, ever. My room was in the back of the house and I would hear
things. I know that old houses still makes sounds from the foundation settling
but I know the difference between that and the sounds I would hear. Anyway
let me get to the point of this story. My room was at the end the back
hallway. If you stood at the end of this hallway you would be looking directly
into the bathroom. My room was directly to the right of the bathroom. My
room had no door but of course the bathroom did. Well my fear of the dark
led to a strange ritual for me. I did not like being in my room after dark
so I would turn on the bathroom light then turn of my light. I would then
go into the bathroom hit the switch and take off running to escape that
dark hallway. Well of course I would have to go to sleep so this was the
ritual for returning to my room. I would run down the hallway until I made
it to the bathroom, once there I would turn on the light and then enter
my room to turn on the light. No this next bit of informationis key. Before
I would leave my room before dark I would make absolute sure that the bathroom
door was open. One night when I was about 13 I was home alone watching
tv in my living room when I realized that I needed my homework out of my
room. I did not want to go back and get it but I worked up enough courage
to go. As by the ritual I took off running down the hallway to reach the
bathroom. Well instead of reaching to bathroom I ran directly into a CLOSED
BATHROOM DOOR! I am not talking about just slightly closed I am talking
about closed all the way. No windows were open, it was winter so there
was no chance of the wind doing it and I was home alone all night so of
course the bathroom door was open. Well needless to say when I hit the
closed bathroom door at full force I broke my nose. I was so scared by
what had happened that without missing a beat I turned and ran back to
the living room broken nose and all. I never told my family about that
night and I tried to reset my nose myself (my nose has a rather large growthplate
on it now because of this). I don't really know how the door got closed
or what closed it but all I know is to this day I get chills remembering
that night. Thanks for listening.</b>

<p><b>Many Experiences</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: chickychick27@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I might be younger than some of you, but I have had a lot of experiences.
I am 13 years old right now. About a week after my 10th birthday my uncle
had killed himself&nbsp; in my grandparents house, the one Im living in
now. After his death I would not go down into the basement ( where it happened.)
The reason for that is I would hear noises and it would only happen when
everyone was in bed and when I was home alone.And when I did go down there
I wonted do it alone. Then about 6 months&nbsp; after my uncles death ,
my 17 year old cousin had died in a car wreck.</b>
<br><b>One night I was so upset over the deaths that I had stumbled down
there. Baling my eyes out thinking about how much I missed them. I was
sitting on the couch thinking about taking my own life so I could be with
them. When I was about to I felt a hand on my shoulder, and I know instanly
that it was my uncle. And sometimes when I walk around the house I can
feel something watching and fowling&nbsp; me, but its not always my uncle
sometimes it feels like something evil .</b>
<br><b>It wasnt to long ago that me and my 21 year old cousin&nbsp; went
to go see her dad. Now this is the cousin that was in the wreck&nbsp; with
the one that passed away. Jean ( 21 yold cousin) had told me that she had
felt her sisters spirit there with her before. And while we were up late
at night talking about her.We suddenly felt her with us , it was like she
was sitting there listening to us.</b>
<br><b>Then not to long ago I was over at a friends going to stay the night.
We were in her room talking about how she thought that maybe she had a
ghost living in her house. And of course Im sitting there nodding my head.
Then I felt something grab my necklace that I was wearing . So we got freaked
out and ran to the living room and checked out my neck. From what ever
had touched me left a great big red check mark on&nbsp; my neck. Then about
5 to 10 min. later it felt like something was grabbing my legs. So I pulled
up my pant legs and I had red marks all over my legs. So me and my friend
decided to get out of the house and go bowling. Over at the bowling alley
the marks had turned white and disappeared. Well when we got back to her
house the marks returned. And I kept feeling things grabbing me and fowling
us everywhere we went, but the&nbsp; weird thing is that nothing was happening
to her and she told me that nothing like this has happened to one of her
other friends before. So we deiced to go to bed well while we were laying
there , it felt like someone had come up and sat down on the bed between
us. So I looked over and no one was there.</b>
<br><b>I havent been over there since. But the only thing I could think
of was that it was an Guarding Angel or it was a ghost that was trying
to protect her from me , because it know of my past or it just didnt like
for some reason.</b>

<p><b>A friend sent me this and suggested that I tell my stories...so hear
is one</b>
<br><b>of them I hope that you enjoy it. I have more if you'd like to hear
more.....</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp; I live in Clinton, Illinois. Which is a small town. We have
a lake and</b>
<br><b>that is about all here. One night I was out joyriding in the country
with a</b>
<br><b>friend as I like to do from time to time and I had to go to the
restroom. So,</b>
<br><b>I went to this access area that is out in the country. I went to
the rest</b>
<br><b>room and then walked thru the pavilion to look at the lake. I then
came back</b>
<br><b>to my car and crawled into the drivers seat. I looked up and there
was this</b>
<br><b>little boy ducking behind a garbage can. He had red eyes that glowed
like a</b>
<br><b>demons and teeth that were jagged and white. A black figure that
looked like</b>
<br><b>a medium sized dog was beside him and it was black all that you
could see was</b>
<br><b>its red eyes..They both stared at us in the car and I felt fear
overwhelm me.</b>
<br><b>I quickly started the car and left. The next day I told my Mom about
it</b>
<br><b>...she grew up in the area and she said that they often had Satan
worshippers</b>
<br><b>out there and that were rumors that a little boy was drown and used
as a</b>
<br><b>sacrifice many years ago. My aunt...says that the little boy was
evil and</b>
<br><b>there fore was put to death in that spot.&nbsp; I have tried to
research this but</b>
<br><b>there are no records of any murder of a child taking place in this
area. But</b>
<br><b>I will NEVER go there a gain....night or day.</b>

<br><b>Grand Island Holiday Inn</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: jpavio@wflboces.org</b><b></b>
<p><b>I read your story on the Shadowlands Web page. Have you stayed at
the Holiday Inn? You should....</b>
<br><b>In&nbsp; early July of 1999, I spend a work week there for a regional
curriculum camp. I had originally be slated to share a room with other
teachers on the first floor. However, the room was a smoking room, and
the odor was causing my asthma to flare up, so I was transferred to a room--dum,
dum, dum, on the fourth floor. (Buggered if I can remember the room number.)
When I retired on Monday night, I had not yet heard of the ghost or any
legends. I was awoken three times during the night by the phone ringing;
I was really ticked because no one was ever there. I vowed to speak with
someone at the front desk about it. In the morning I learned about "Tonya",
the ghost. We all laughed at the story, thinking it was something to amuse
tourists. Being WNY natives, we weren't going to be suckered by any such
nonsense. I forgot to talk to anyone about the phone and decided not to
bother.</b>
<br><b>I fell asleep very quickly that night. I was awakened that night
by the sensation that someone was staring at me from the left side of the
bed. (I have small children. My son often wakes me using the stare method.)Now,
I might have thought the ghost story was crap, but I wasn't going to test
the theory by looking to see what was next to me. I said, "Go away; I'm&nbsp;
not going to look at you. I need my sleep". The sensation immediately left
me, and I slept the rest of the night quite peacefully. I awoke and went
to my morning sessions without anything remarkable happening. However,
I had to return to my room mid-morning to fetch some papers I needed for
the next session. The curtains were open on the doors leading out to my
balcony, which was not unusual; housekeeping always opened the drapes after
cleaning. What was unusual was the number of small, sticky hand prints
all over the OUTSIDE of the doors. These were no higher than my waist.
I shook my head at the poor cleaning job. I was sure that the previous
guests must have had children with them and that the maid had failed to
clean the prints off the glass. I wondered how hard it was to open the
doors and give the glass a good cleaning, and then I hustled off to make
my session.</b>
<br><b>As the day progressed, I heard more tales of Tanya, like how she
throws the poolside chairs into the pool during the night, etc. We giggled
amongst ourselves like good campers should when hearing ghost stories.
None of was going to admit we believed any of it, especially when our principals
were listening! So, I was half joking when I was in my room getting ready
for bed and said out loud," Listen Tanya, I don't know how old you are,
but I think you'll enjoy the books in the Falls Room.[I think that's the
correct conference room name.] If you can read, you'll really like them.
Even if you can't, lots of them are full of beautiful pictures that I bet
you'll like to look at. Go there instead of bugging me." I slept like a
log without any interruptions that night.</b>
<br><b>When I went to breakfast the next morning, I told a colleague about
my "chat" with Tanya. I mentioned that it must have worked because I'd
slept so well. I stopped talking when I saw my colleague's jaw drop and
her face go white. I asked her what the matter was, and she took me over
to the professor who was leading the session in the Falls room. My colleague
said to the professor, "Tell us what you found in the room this morning."
I listened in stunned silence as the professor described what a mess the
room was. Books were thrown all over the place. The display table was in
shambles, and her boxes of supplies had been unpacked and poorly repacked.
In her own words, she said, "it looks like a little kid went through everything
and tried to put things back together but couldn't manage". The professor
had questioned the hotel staff about who had access to the room, etc, and
all swore that no-one had been in the room after we left and that the door
had been locked until the staff let the professor in the morning. I apologized
when she finished and explained that I had probably caused the mess by
inviting Tanya to go there. We all laughed uneasily at that. Some other
teachers on the 4th floor admitted to strange things, like the ringing
phone(no caller) and the sensation of being watched. Suddenly we weren't
so sure the story was something just to amuse the tourists.</b>
<br><b>Were the phone calls, staring sensations, sticky finger prints,
and trashed conference room related? There could be logical explanations
like incorrectly routed calls, poor cleaning, and staff mischief. Maybe
Tanya was drawn to all us warm, female, motherly type teachers. (No male
teachers that I know of on that floor, and yes, all of us are Moms too.)
One thing is for sure, I am far less skeptical of the paranormal than I
was before, and I will admit (even to my principal) that something odd
happened in that hotel.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;If you really want to check out the paranormal, then you have
to go the Grand Island Holiday Inn - you can pretend you came to see Niagara
Falls!</b>

<br><b>My Nana</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: mpdsmom@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;Love the site!&nbsp; Keep up the great work!</b>
<br><b>I wanted to share my own personal experience with you</b>
<br><b>regarding my beloved nana (she passed away in 1984).</b>
<br><b>I took her death very hard, and would go to visit her</b>
<br><b>grave often.</b>
<br><b>After my now ex-husband and I married (in 1998), I</b>
<br><b>became pregnant within the year.&nbsp; Since I knew that my</b>
<br><b>ex and I would not stay together for the long term,</b>
<br><b>and since our marriage was so troubled, I found myself</b>
<br><b>up at nana's grave many times, sometimes just to talk</b>
<br><b>to her and ask her to guide me, and to watch over</b>
<br><b>myself and the baby.</b>
<br><b>The first time I went to see her grave (I hadn't been</b>
<br><b>there for nearly two years at the time), I was pretty</b>
<br><b>certain of what row her stone was in, but not</b>
<br><b>completely sure.&nbsp; I asked her out loud to help me find</b>
<br><b>her, and so help me God if I'm lying, I ended parking</b>
<br><b>directly in front of her row!&nbsp; I thanked her, and</b>
<br><b>walked over to her grave, placing a single rose on it,</b>
<br><b>and crying.&nbsp; I was about six months pregnant with my</b>
<br><b>daughter at the time, and I was very certain that her</b>
<br><b>love for us would get us through the rough months</b>
<br><b>ahead.</b>
<br><b>Shortly after our daughter was born, my ex-husband and</b>
<br><b>I were having major problems, major fights, and it was</b>
<br><b>obvious to both of us that we would eventually split</b>
<br><b>up permanently.&nbsp; We separated when my daughter was</b>
<br><b>three months old, and I moved into an apartment with</b>
<br><b>my infant.</b>
<br><b>Shortly after, I could "feel" my nana's prescence.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>never saw anything (I always asked her not to appear</b>
<br><b>to me, as she knew I would be afraid), but her</b>
<br><b>presence was unmistakable, especially in my daughter's</b>
<br><b>nursery.&nbsp; It never frightened me-conversely, I felt</b>
<br><b>very comforted and protected.</b>
<br><b>As a new mother, I took many photos of my infant those</b>
<br><b>first few months.&nbsp; I never noticed until a friend</b>
<br><b>pointed out to me, that in one of them, which was a</b>
<br><b>picture of the nursery, there is a vortex on the</b>
<br><b>right, like a solid bar of white light, and to the</b>
<br><b>left of that, an arched mist that almost looks like</b>
<br><b>the shape of a rainbow, but you can see the wall right</b>
<br><b>through it.&nbsp; Also, the picture of the room came out as</b>
<br><b>if I had taken it from on the floor, or close to the</b>
<br><b>floor, and pointed the camera up.&nbsp; I would have never</b>
<br><b>taken a picture from that angle, and I know I didn't.</b>
<br><b>I cried when I realized that the vortex and the light</b>
<br><b>are my nana, watching over her great-granddaughter and</b>
<br><b>me. I don't think it's a coincidence, either, that the</b>
<br><b>photo is focused on the rocking chair and the mist is</b>
<br><b>right across it.</b>
<br><b>I should also mention that shortly after my nana</b>
<br><b>passed away in the 80's, and my brother and I still</b>
<br><b>lived at home with my parents, that one night I was up</b>
<br><b>reading in bed, and walked out into the kitchen.&nbsp; My</b>
<br><b>brother was sitting at the kitchen table, shaking and</b>
<br><b>white as a sheet, almost crying.&nbsp; A second later, my</b>
<br><b>mother walked out of her bedroom, and she was crying.</b>
<br><b>They both professed, at exactly the same moment, that</b>
<br><b>they had seen nana appear to them, and tell them not</b>
<br><b>to worry and that she was all right.&nbsp; I might add that</b>
<br><b>their bedrooms were on opposite sides of the house!</b>
<br><b>My mother also had a separate incident where she saw</b>
<br><b>my nana at the end of her bed.&nbsp; She wasn't at all</b>
<br><b>afraid, just comforted.</b>
<br><b>I still visit my nana, just to say hello, and it</b>
<br><b>comforts me to know that someday I will meet her</b>
<br><b>again.&nbsp; In the meantime, it helps when life gets rough</b>
<br><b>to feel her loving prescence.&nbsp; Thanks for letting me</b>
<br><b>share this experience.</b>

<p><b>Ghosts and Hauntings Story</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Damia433@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I've had many experiences with ghosts and hauntings, all beginning
around age</b>
<br><b>3.&nbsp; I am now 28 and my connections to ghosts and spirits has
only grown</b>
<br><b>stronger with time.&nbsp; I suppose I should start with&nbsp; my
earliest haunting.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>was around 10 years of age, my parents had just divorced, and I
was feeling</b>
<br><b>very alone and angry.</b>
<br><b>I don't like to sleep with my bedroom door open.&nbsp; When I did,
I felt I was</b>
<br><b>being watched.&nbsp; One summer night, the air was hot and humid,
and I had no</b>
<br><b>choice but to sleep with my door open to get a cool cross breeze.&nbsp;
I remember</b>
<br><b>waking up sometime around midnight or shortly thereafter, feeling
I was being</b>
<br><b>watched.&nbsp; When I looked out my bedroom door, I saw a frightening
sight.&nbsp; A</b>
<br><b>figure, with pure black skin, bright yellow eyes and a cloak of
red, white</b>
<br><b>and black harlequin-like design was staring at me, it's hands on
the door</b>
<br><b>jam, about to enter the threshold of my room.&nbsp; I screamed,
saw it's eyes</b>
<br><b>widen in shock, possibly, and flee down the hall adjacent to my
room.&nbsp; I saw</b>
<br><b>it's robes fluttering after it as it fled.&nbsp; My scream woke
my family who</b>
<br><b>searched the house for the thing (lack of a better word),&nbsp;
but found nothing.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;All the doors were locked, no windows were broken.&nbsp; I
shut my door, put up</b>
<br><b>with the heat, and it hasn't returned since.&nbsp; I've been told
that the</b>
<br><b>creature was a demon.&nbsp; I also found out I was depressed at
the time, and may</b>
<br><b>have been drawing it to me.&nbsp; I can still feel it's presence
when I think</b>
<br><b>about it feel very frightened just remembering the experience.</b>

<p><b>My Story</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:DS4794@prodigy.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>This is one of the first experiences I have had. I hope this site
is serious and it looks as though it is. I live in Kenosha, Wisconsin which
is on the shore of Lake Michigan. I can't remember how old I was probably
7-9 yrs. old. My Dad had taken me down to Southport which is a park by
the lake. I can still remember after all this time. I am now 34. IIt was
a stormy day out, not raining yet but very overcast and a little foggy.
My dad was standing nearby and I went down by the water. I looked out over
the lake and if I had not seen it I would not have believed it. There was
an old-day ship in the water. It was all wood and on the deck of the ship
I saw two men. One man was standing by a mast and the other man was hanging
over the edge of the ship on top of what appeared to me a net of sorts
only it was made of thick rope and the spaces inbetween the weaves was
to great to catch fish so I don't know what exactly it was. It was hanging
over the edge of the ship as well. The man that was hanging over the side
had what looked like a knife in his back. I know it sounds crazy. Let me
just say that as a child I was frightened by what I saw and ran back to
my dad. I told him what I saw and told him to look but he said he did not
see anything. I have tried to do some investigating on ghost ships of lake
michigan but cannot locate anything specific. I have even looked at the
schooner pictures I have found but truthfully I have to say that the ship
was older than that it was for lack of a better words a ship like you see
on the documentaries on tv regarding Christopher Columbus etc. ships of
that kind.It even had the sails up. I am not sure if ships like that made
it this far inland but that is what I saw.</b>
<br><b>Another experience I had was one that affected me many times. I
was very close to the same age and my great grandmother whom I was close
to had died. Soon after (please I am not crazy) I began waking up at night
to a voice whispering my name. Not Dan or Danny but Daniel my full name.
Going into my parents room when scared was not an option so I would go
into our bathroom where the light was always kept on. Believe me I would
stay in there and fall asleep again. I dont think my parents ever asked
me why I did that and I never even to this day told them. This would happen
almost nightly. My parents went on vacation and left me with my grandparents
for the two weeks they were gone. They lived in kenosha as well. I was
relieved as I did not have to worry about the voice waking me(I never saw
an image or ghost etc. just the voice). I was wrong. I woke up one evening
to the voice again. I had never snuck into bed with my grandpa ever accept
this time I was really scared. I grabbed my blanket and went to my grandfathers
room. I opened then closed the door and layed down on the floor next to
his bed. He was a very no nonsense guy who would have let the sparks fly
if I woke him. After I closed the door I settled in to go to sleep figuring
the voice wouldn't follow me. I had just put my head down when the door
opened and I felt a "breeze" go down the length of the bed ruffling the
dust cover of the bed. I think after that I finally fell asleep as I would
absolutely not wake my grandfather.</b>
<br><b>Another experience... My dad owned a very old 2 flat house. My wife,
children and I lived upstairs. I work third shift so at that time on the
weekends I was usually up late, very late. All the lights were turned off
which is how I liked it. All except for me were well asleep. There was
a food pantry adjacent to the kitchen. There was a certain way you had
to shut the door to the pantry or it would not close. I went into the kitchen
and sat at the kitchen table. I remember starting to think about how old
the house was and about the people who had lived there throughout the years.
I don't know why I thought of this I just did. I began thinking about ghosts
and how it has been reported that they can appear as they want. I kept
thinking to myself that if there were any ghosts in the house that if they
chose to show themselves it would be in human form and not some hideous
creature. As I was sitting at the table the pantry door slowly opened.
I did not see anything but I cannot explain how scared I was. I knew that
the door could not open by itself, it was impossible. Despite being scared
I stayed there, okay maybe to scared to move. I then had thoughts of the
people that used to live in the house. These are those thoughts... the
family that lived there(when I don't know) were excited about a fair that
was the big thing in Kenosha. Everyone and everybody would be there. One
girl from the family did not want to go, I think perhaps she was to rondevou
with her boyfriend although I am not quite sure. Anyway while her family
was at the fair someone broke into the house thinking everyone would be
at the fair. Unfortuneately they were not. The girl was raped then murdered.
Again I did not see anything like apparations but I just thought through
this. I did not want to see a ghost (especially after the door opened)
These are my stories and I hope this site is a serious site. There are
a few experiences that I have not wrote about but I will save them for
later, Thank you for listening.</b>

<br><b>A Tale for the List</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: ElfaWylde@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;My Mom</b>
<br><b>My mother had been very ill for quite a while and i had given up
my job to</b>
<br><b>take care of her.&nbsp; we lived in a trailer then and often i was
doing laundry</b>
<br><b>or house work at the other end form her room.&nbsp; So in order
to call me she'd</b>
<br><b>whistle.&nbsp; a kind of "hey you!" sound.</b>
<br><b>My Mother died in February of 1999.&nbsp; by March I had moved out
of my parent's</b>
<br><b>house and in with my grandmother.&nbsp; by the end of October 1999,
i had met and</b>
<br><b>moved in with my now husband and we had just moved into our own
home and</b>
<br><b>planned to be married.&nbsp; We had just moved into the new house
and i was beat</b>
<br><b>after unpacking most of the morning.&nbsp; I decided to take a nice
hot bubble</b>
<br><b>bath.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I was relaxing in the tub... kind of daydreaming, when i heard
the familiar</b>
<br><b>whistle.</b>
<br><b>I was out of the tub, wrapped in a towel and half way through my
new living</b>
<br><b>room when it dawned on me that my mother was dead, I was in my own
home...</b>
<br><b>and that I had Been asleep in the tub!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I said
out loud "thanks Mom!" and</b>

<p><b>My Brother</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:jenny_fer69@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>This happened when my brother was around five years old.&nbsp; It
was around 2am</b>
<br><b>and he went into my parents room to get in bed with my mom.&nbsp;
My moms bed was</b>
<br><b>right by one of the the bathroom doors.&nbsp; The door on the other
end of the</b>
<br><b>bathroom led to where the back door was and the stairs to the basement.&nbsp;
He</b>
<br><b>got in bed and was facing the bathroom.&nbsp; He got scared and
woke up my mom</b>
<br><b>and asked who the little girl in the bathroom was.&nbsp; He said
he had never</b>
<br><b>seen her before.&nbsp; He told my mom that she was just standing
there staring at</b>
<br><b>him.&nbsp; My mom said the way he was talking, like there was really
someone</b>
<br><b>there, it really scared her.&nbsp; She said she just rolled over
and shut her</b>
<br><b>eyes.&nbsp; She was too scare to even look.&nbsp; I don't think
a 5 year old imagines</b>
<br><b>things like that.&nbsp; While we were in the same house, my moms
cousin was</b>
<br><b>hunting in the mountains and accidentally fell on his gun and killed</b>
<br><b>himself.&nbsp; The family thinks he came back to say bye, because
it was such a</b>
<br><b>sudden death.&nbsp; A few days after he died when we were all in
bed, the light</b>
<br><b>in the hallway bathroom would click on and off.&nbsp; It was an
older house, so</b>
<br><b>the switch made a really loud click when you turned it on and off.&nbsp;
My mom</b>
<br><b>would be sitting on the couch late at night ...with her back facing
the</b>
<br><b>hallway.&nbsp; You can sometimes feel when someone is behind you...
and She said</b>
<br><b>she heard me breathing hard and walking up the hallway.&nbsp; She
called my name</b>
<br><b>and turned around and no one was there.&nbsp; At the same time at
her cousins</b>
<br><b>parents and sisters house similar things were happening.&nbsp;&nbsp;
His old toys from</b>
<br><b>when he was younger were stored in the basement of his parents house.&nbsp;
One</b>
<br><b>night his electric train turned on and was going around the track.&nbsp;
No one</b>
<br><b>knew this was happening to other family members until my mom called
his</b>
<br><b>parents and told them what was happening to her.&nbsp; The next
day they went</b>
<br><b>somewhere and tried to contact him.&nbsp; They all said they loved
him and it was</b>
<br><b>time for him to move on.&nbsp; They think he was trying to contact

<br><b>A B&amp;B Experience</b>
<br><b>By: fredrik_ahlstrand@swipnet.se</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>The following happened back in July 1995.Me and a friend travelled
round UK by train.It was about 4p.m then we checked in at a bed and breakfast
in Manchester.All double room was occupied,so we got 2 single room wich
was located next to each other.We were quite tired after a long day trip
by train so we rest for a moment,later we went out to eat something,had
a beer in the hotel bar and then headed up to the rooms for sleeping.The
time was about 11p.m then I closed the venetian blind,turn off the light
and almost immediately fall asleep.The room was pitch-dark.Then,after about
2 hours I woke up and find the room bathed in light,the light almost blinded
me.I had a strong emotion that walk to the window,just like I was enforced
to do so and then I went up I heard voices and music,like old folklore
or something.The voices was only like murmur so I actually couldn&acute;t
here what it says.It was like being in a full up restaurant or a pub or
something.I was not actually scared but it was a uneasy and confusing experience.Then
I reach the window and opened the venetian blind,everything turned to normal
again,quiet and pitch-dark.I went back to bed again and to my surprise
I fall asleep after only about 10 minutes.The morning after we met up and
headed down the stairs for breakfast.Afraid of being regarded as a fool
or jackass I told him it was only a dream.Then,I almost drop the coffee
pot then he told me that exactly the same happens to him.He has always
been quite sceptical to the paranormal things,but I think this experience
have changed his mind a bit.</b>
<br><b>I would be very glad if you could give me your opinion,apprehension
about what really happened that night.I know I was full awakened and it
can&acute;t be my imagination &acute;cos the same happened to him.As I
said in previous mail I&acute;m not so good in english,so I hope you understand
me.You may publish my story if you want,but you better circumscribe it

<p><b>Haunted Dreams</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: radiant17@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I may only be 10 (well almost 11) but i know what i saw.Throughout
my life i have seen ghosts or even something else.I will tell you my stories.Please
don't laugh they weren't funny.It all started when i was 4 years old.I
was sitting in bed and i was really upset because my sister was being mean.I
hid under the covers, which i always did sense i was born, and waited.I
heard my door open and i peeked out of my covers and there wasn't anything
there.Then when i heard footsteps i sat up and saw a figure...from about
the 1960's.She has curly hair and was staring at me.I started shaking.She
smiled at me and disapeared.The next morning i woke up and went downstairs
where my mom was putting up a picture.I looked at the picture and it was
of the figure i saw during the night.I asked my mom who she was.My mom
said she was her mom who died when she was 4 of cancer.The following 3
years i saw the same figure on the date of her death.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Starting when I was 6 years old i had a
shelf on my wall with dolls on it.I don't know if this is a ghost storie...but
it's paranormal!Every night i would try to go to sleep and i would see
either a dolls head move or the eyes would blink.I would tell my mom and
dad and they would tell me that couldn't happen.So one night i looked out
and saw my dolls hand up in the air.I just hid under the covers and cried.When
i got to sleep i had a dream i will never forget.The dream was:</b>
<br><b>My parents in i went on a trip and i wanted to bring all my dolls.We
stayed in a cabin with a loft.My sister and i would sleep on the couch.The
dolls were in the loft.One day my parents and sister were outside talking
to the nextdoor visitors.I was inside.The clock made a ding...it was 12:00.The
dolls started marching down the stairs with knives.My family came in and
were all dead the second they stepped in the room.The leader of the dolls
came up to me and jumped on me.She stabbed me in the back.I died.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; I woke up about a minute later .My back hurt in the
same spot as in the dream where she stabbed me.I looked at the doll who
stabbed me.She had always had a face w/ a frown.Now it was a smile , a
dirty smile....</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;When i was 9 all of the dreams stopped.The only paranormal
thing was when i saw my dog who died the year i was born.He walked across
the floor.and looked at me...then disapeared.I was wondering if you think
these stories are real.Also is there a way i can bring my dog back? (even
as a ghost).Thanks.Please post these stories on your site.and tell me when
you do.</b>

<br><b>A Few Stories</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: tiggerwoman79@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hello.&nbsp; I just wanted to tell you a couple of my</b>
<br><b>stories.&nbsp; I lived in a house in Decatur, IL with my</b>
<br><b>parents and my sister.&nbsp; Since the day we moved in, I</b>
<br><b>felt as though I was being watched.&nbsp; I hated going</b>
<br><b>into the basement, especially at night and just had a</b>
<br><b>very eerie feeling about the place.&nbsp; Shortly after we</b>
<br><b>moved in my mother complained that she occasionally</b>
<br><b>smelled a bad odor wafting by.&nbsp; She said that it was</b>
<br><b>"like someone with really bad B.O. just walked by</b>
<br><b>her."&nbsp; This continued until my mom, sister and I moved</b>
<br><b>out due to my parents divorce.&nbsp; While we were living</b>
<br><b>in this house we had 2 dogs, a full grown Lab, and a</b>
<br><b>Springer Spaniel puppy that we got while living there.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;As she got older she would act wierd.&nbsp; Several times</b>
<br><b>she would act as if she were tracking something</b>
<br><b>through the house.&nbsp; Springers are hunting dogs and</b>
<br><b>have very keen noses and an instinct to track.&nbsp; A few</b>
<br><b>times she would track this smell through the house and</b>
<br><b>my mom would smell the 'b.o.'&nbsp; There was a crawl space</b>
<br><b>in the basement to get to other parts of the house.</b>
<br><b>Then entrace was covered by a piece of plywood that,</b>
<br><b>in order to open, you had to pull 2 nails out of the</b>
<br><b>way.&nbsp; Well I was downstairs doing laundry one day and</b>
<br><b>looked at that piece of plywood and it was, of course,</b>
<br><b>closed.&nbsp; A short while later I went downstairs to let</b>
<br><b>the dogs in, and looked at the piece of plywood, and</b>
<br><b>it was down.&nbsp; No one had been downstairs because I was</b>
<br><b>where I could see the door to the basement the whole</b>

<p><b>A Few Strange Stories</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: mclarksites@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have been wanting to write about some of my numerous (to say the
least) experiences since discovering your page about a year ago, and figure
that now is as good a time as any. I would like share a few with you, so
I hope this submission isn't too long.</b>
<br><b>Although I don't consider myself "psychic" in the having, visions,
premonitions, or definite impressions about things way, I have a strong
relationship with the paranormal that started- I think- when I was about
three, when I&nbsp; began to have distinct memories of being drawn into
my parents' bedroom alone, lying down on the bed, and suddenly being seized
by a terrifying sense of icy paralysis, accompanied by the feeling that
there was a presence either trying to subdue me or get "into" my body.
This could have been a form of sleep paralysis with scientifically explainable
origins- but I could never get over the memory of this terrible sensation.
Or escape the feeling that I was constantly being watched, even when I
was completely alone. Our house, in rural West Virginia, was built in mid-1920's,
and is situated on a farm that has been owned by our family since pioneer
days. During its hey-day, our house was the epicenter of a busy farm production,
was filled with people- parents, children, and hired hands- and has, probably,
absorbed all kinds of psychic emissions from its inhabitants. To my knowledge,
only one person has ever died on the premises- my father's infant sister,
in the early 1930's. This house has also- to my knowledge- been a happy
place, full of love. However, it is situated next door, and on the same
land as, my great-grandparents' house. This house pre-dates the Civil War,
was home to dozens of people- including dozens of slaves who are buried
in several now unmarked graves around the property. I know that at least
one slave was murdered at this house ( it too, has always been in my family),
and many hired hands and intinerants made brief stays in the house and
even the barn. I don't know whether the house next door is haunted- but
will doubtlessly find out when my sister and I inherit it one day!</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Nonetheless, while I have been at this house, I have been
susceptible to extreme sad moods- to the point of despair, and once heard
a strange voice- almost like something in slow motion- say to me " Let
us out, why don't you please let us out?". I know that sounds like I'm
crazy, but I believe that these feelings may have been some kind of psychic
assault. Also, my sister and I, as well as several friends have mine have
gotten the distinct impression that our house is haunted- by what or whom
we can not say. Several low-key, yet strange, things have happened to us
here- I remember as a small child, being "kissed" on the cheek while i
was in bed; dreaming- half asleep/half awake that there were people in
my room and talking with them; there have been footsteps, slamming doors,
and piano keys being played downstairs at night while everyone was in their
bedrooms, upstairs; my sister was "bitten" by something (like an animal)
on the leg while sleeping in my grandparents' old room; and once, while
I was downstairs doing a watercolor, I suddenly looked up to see the room
filled with snapping, dancing sparks of light-at the time, I thought they
were "fairies", and was exhilarated!</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; Although nothing more dramatic has happened in this house,
there is a definite, mysterious presence here. It is also an ambiguous
presence- at times, I feel like I have been visited by an extremely benevolent,
loving force, and at other times, the atmosphere in our house is very frightening
and- not altogether hostile, but charged. Recently, since I have been home
this summer, I have felt like befriending the spirits- talking to them
and telling them of my good intentions. I get the sense that this has been
very positive- I will now however, tell you of two more stories that have
happened to me at other places- one that was very cool, and the other that
was extremely frightening.</b>
<br><b>I first "saw" a ghost, not at my house, but when I was fifteen years
old- while my parents and I were touring this dilapidated mansion in Virginia.
The place is called "Swannanoa", and since my experience, i have learned
that it is a notoriously haunted place, albeit by a friendly and beautiful
ghost. My memory of the place is this-I remember being impressed and sad
by the state of the house and ground at the time- the house was being opened
for tours- I assume to help generate money- but the signs of years of neglect
were evident. The couple who had owned it were intellectuals and spiritualists
in the 1920's, and the whole place had an intriguing, yet melancholy vibe.
I remember being in this one room, looking at portraits drawn by the husband-
when i "felt" someone come up behind me. I turned to speak to whom I supposed
was my mother, when I saw the wispy, white outline of a woman reaching
towards me. I remember seeing white hair, and long wispy garments- and
she was see-through, the classic "ghost". I wasn't scared at all, just
shocked as she faded into nothing. I immediately went and found my parents
in the foyer, and told them- and of course, they thought I was crazy. :)
And as the years went by, I began to think that I had imagined it! However,
about eight years later, around Halloween, I was exchanging ghost stories
with a former employer when I told them this story. It so happened that
my employer, who was a photographer, had done photo shoots for weddings
held at the house while its Mistress was still alive. He described her
as a beautiful lady, extremely gracious, and who had white hair and had
the eccentric, yet charming habit of dressing all in white. She used to
come out and wave to them from a balcony, while they were photographing
weddings in the main part of the house. I feel sure she was the one I saw
that day- because she had died some time before then. And because of the
things that went on at that house- the spiritualist matters, I feel sure
that she was merely trying to contact me out of friendliness- such was
my feeling, and such was the supporting evidence... :) And I am happy that
she did so.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the bad thing that happened to me-
this happened while i was at college- a small, old, women's college, which
is- I believe, one of THE most haunted places in the United States. It
was my Freshman year, and my friend had a boring work-study job in the
music library- in a really haunted building, and where few people- save
music students with listening assignments- ever went. When I would visit
her while she worked there, sometimes, we would try to communicate with
the ghosts we believe haunted the building. We would make home-made Ouija
boards out of notebook paper and use a ring of scotch tape for the marker-
and once we tried doing this automatic drawing type of thing. It was pretty
much for innocent entertainment. Although one really crazy story involving
a record player and an "invisible operator" happened there, I will skip
to the really weird story, that ended up having negative consequences.
Once, we were trying the automatic drawing thing, where we would both hold
a pencil and ask a ghost to draw&nbsp; a portrait of itself- and although
I am an artist, I made a very deliberate effort not even to hold the pencil-as
a kind of a test to my friend. The pencil, the two of us, and the "ghost"
produced this drawing of a man in what I would call the classic Elizabethan
Jamestown outfit- neck rufflle, puffy pants, and page boy hair. It was
surprising, especially when the pencil began to produce really dark circles
under his eyes, and a straight, grim line for the mouth. When we asked,
"why do you look that way?", the pencil (with our hands on it) moved, and
wrote on the paper next to the drawing. "I am serious." We asked it several
questions, among which, was the name of his wife- which I will never forget,
because it was also the name of a friend who was killed a year later. And
the way the pencil wrote the name was strange because it was made with
the flourishes of an old-fashioned script- which neither of us could figure
out until it was through writing. My friend saved the paper- because it
was so freaky- but the really freaky thing happened to me about a week
later, when I was alone in my dorm room.</b>
<br><b>I was trying to go to sleep, despite the fact of being slightly
afraid because my roommate was gone, when suddenly I felt this "presence"
come down the hall of our dorm, and through the door of our room. I know
that I was awake, because I remember staring at the cinderblock wall as
the "thing" crouched by my bed and whispered, in a raspy, evil masculine
voice, "Stay Awake! Stay Awake! Stay Awake!" I remembered praying to Jesus
Christ- something I rarely did- and then, suddenly, it went away. However,
by that time, I was so scared, that I did just what the spirit wanted me
to do- I was a nervous, wide-awake wreck all night. I turned on the light,
and the television, and was about to drift off again to sleep, somewhere
around 2:00 in the morning, when the "thing" came back, and went to the
corner of the room, this time laughing maliciously at me. I was afraid
to look at it, although i could tell it was a definitely male presence.
Although I am not sure that the spirit doing the drawing was the one that
visited me- I felt like we had gotten the attention of something not very
friendly. That was the clearest time that he came into my room, however,
I could sense him lurking around a lot.&nbsp; A few years later, I found
out from other occupants of that hall, that he had been making the rounds...</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I could write about other miraculous or scary
occurences, but I think that I have taken up enough space already. I will
just say that despite having scary stuff happen, I think that it is really
an extremely comforting thing to have had personally- and to have heard
about so many- ghost visitations. I think that it is undeniable evidence
that humans have energies that survive after death- whether these energies
are the same as the actual person, we will never know. I do however, think
that there are ways for the dead to contact us- in both loving and dreadful
ways. The best bet, I think, is to make friends with ghosts if you get
the sense that they are not malevolent, just "there". But stay away from
open invitations. I don't know why we are scared of ghosts- unless we react
on a spiritual level to trauma or hatred within another spirit. I believe,
however, that having positive thoughts and having a relationship with God-
helps bolster one's psychic shield. I don't think ghosts can hurt you unless
you let them- but some do desperately want to feed off your energy. Please
feel free to email me with any questions- or for more stories. And thanks
for reading.</b><b></b>

<p><b>A Friends Creepy Story</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: sweetiepie354@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>This isn't my story but a friend's. But I will tell it as he did.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Back a couple years ago, he was staying in his grandmother's house
for a week while his family moved. He was trying to sleep one night when
he felt the bed being weighed down by something somewhat heavy. Probably
about 145 pounds. When he turned to look, he saw the faint outline of a
human figure. It was jaunty-looking, but that's all he could really make
out. He fell asleep soon after that, thinking that it was probably only
his imagination. Two nights later ( it was a Saturday) he and his sister
were staying up late watching Nick at Nite. He got up to go to the bathroom
during commercial break. While he was washing his hands, he heard a tapping
at the window and looked towards it to see a face peering in at him. From
what he told me, it was a young man of about twenty-something with a blond
crew cut and gigantic dark eyes. He could see and see through it at the
same time and he got out of there as quick as he could. He saw the ghost
boy a couple times after that, but not that often. Once in a while, it
would appear in the bathroom window and other times, it would sit on my
friend's bed.</b>
<br><b>A couple years later, after he told me the story, we went to his
grandma's house and we told her about his experiences. He mostly saw the
boy in the bathroom window, sometimes in his room. His grandmother said
that a boy had died in that bathroom back in the 1940's from a drug overdose
after he found out that his wife had been sleeping with another man.</b>
<br><b>It gives me the chills thinking about that.</b><b></b>

<p><b>A Haunting I Experienced</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: karen.spring@home.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I know you collect haunting stories and here is one I experienced,
although my husband swears it isn't true.</b>
<br><b>In the fall of 1999, my husband and I decided to spend a long weekend
in Gettysburg. We were newlyweds and had honeymooned at the beginning of
the summer, but we had not had the opportunity to enjoy any time away since
then. So, I chose Gettysburg, because I had been there as a teenager and
had fallen in love with the beautiful little town that had an important,
if not sad, past. We spent the weekend in a quaint bed and breakfast inn,
and our days were filled with walks through the town and a tour of the
battlefield. On our last evening there, a Sunday night, we decided to take
part in a ghost tour. We ate dinner at the famously haunted Farnsworth
Inn and then joined the group that was forming outside to take the ghost
tour. Our guide was a man dressed in Civil War garb. He carried a lantern
and he told us wonderful tales about the history of Gettysburg and the
battle that had taken place on the streets and in the fields. It was an
almost frightening feeling to me. Here I was, standing on hallowed ground.
I could almost sense the energy rising up from the ground. We walked through
the streets as our guide pointed out the historic buildings and told us
about the citizens who had lived in them and who still haunted such places.
As we walked, I noticed the town getting increasingly quiet. Children came
in from playing, and adults were preparing for the workday. Around 11 PM,
we came back to a grassy knoll across from the Farnsworth Inn. The guide
was describing one last story to our group but I heard nothing of it. It
was at this time, that I began to hear gunfire...off in the distance. I
shivered in the chill October air, and looked around, but amazingly no
one else seemed to hear the noise. Was I hearing things? Suddenly, a young
girl, about 20, who was standing next to me, caught my glance. "Do you
hear that, too?" she asked me nervously. I nodded, unable to say a word.
The look on my face must have been one of shock, because my husband leaned
over and whispered, "Honey, it's nothing. There's some kids over there
playing with cap guns." I did not see any children playing with cap guns
during the tour or afterwards when we started back for our inn, but I distinctively
heard gunfire. To this day, my husband swears it was children playing,
but no one else in the group with the exception of the girl to the left
of me, my husband, and me even acknowledged the noise. Hadn't they heard
it? It wasn't a completely scary sound, but it was kind of like the ghosts
wanted us to know they were there.. if it was indeed ghosts at all. I also
find it hard to believe that any mother would allow her children to be
outside on a school night firing cap guns in the complete darkness. Last
year, I sent an e-mail to the Farnsworth Inn, describing the incident and
the person who responded told me that she has had people describe the same,
exact experience to her. Sometimes, she said, only certain people hear
the noise.</b>
<br><b>I don't know what I heard, but I'm convinced I heard something from
beyond this world. My husband continues to say it was just a bunch of kids
playing outside on that October night.</b><b></b>

<br><b>A Haunting of Several</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: starling@interactive.rogers.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>If you have ever heard of the Woodlawn Cultural centre in brantford</b>
<br><b>Ontario. You&nbsp; would know that it was a residential school for
natives.</b>
<br><b>Well anyway we lived in the House that is on the grounds. When we
first</b>
<br><b>moved in the lights and noises were alot. We got used of sharing
the</b>
<br><b>space with several enities.</b>
<br><b>One enity was in old clothes like a minister. He would come out
of the</b>
<br><b>back door and walk around the house to the front of the house and</b>
<br><b>disappear. There was another enity in the house that seemed to act
like</b>
<br><b>a poltergist. Books falling off the selfves. Dresser drawers opening.</b>
<br><b>The fear off my girls was great, once it followed her into my bedroom</b>
<br><b>and the bed began to shake. Like in horror movies. I yelled in my
native</b>
<br><b>language, for this was quite enough and we will find out what you
are</b>
<br><b>and how to release your spirit from this place. Until you are not
to</b>
<br><b>bother any of my children agian. Needless to say it stopped.</b>
<br><b>Once this stopped then the cold spot appeared in the attic. Boy
was that</b>
<br><b>ever nice inthe hot summer. Just to stand in there and get cooled
off.</b>
<br><b>People would stay at the house overnight and be so scared in the</b>
<br><b>morning. They would not want to stay in there agian.</b>
<br><b>One day I was up in the attic and I said alright I know you are
here let</b>
<br><b>me see you. Our ceremony didn't work so you must be of a different</b>
<br><b>nation. Let me see you. I can see the other side I have a gift.</b>
<br><b>Well then it started the (what I call a vision) Tthere in the attic
I</b>
<br><b>saw this. Tthere was an older man who wanted the child to do something</b>
<br><b>Tthe child refused. Tthe man got angry and hit the child. Tthe child
hit</b>
<br><b>the brick chimmy with his head and never moved. He died the man
picked</b>
<br><b>the child up and took him to the back yard and burried him. He planted</b>
<br><b>an apple tree in the spot where he burried him. So I had an objibway
man</b>
<br><b>come and&nbsp; release his spirit and to this day no cold spot....</b>
<br><b>I can see horrid things that happened in different places. It sometimes</b>
<br><b>is to much for me but if there is something they need or being released.</b>

<br><b>A House In Arkansas</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: sarahbrewer@peoplepc.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>When I was fourteen my mother and father bought a little country
store just outside of Leachville Arkansas. Our house was attached to the
store. The building was built in the late eighteen hundreds. One night
my parents decided to go fishing and I told them I would rather stay home
for the evening because I was tired from working. My parents had left and
I decided to get some rest. I had been asleep for an hour or so and I heard
what I thought was someone going through the silverware drawers. I got
up to go and see who was there but the house was empty. I thought maybe
it was my mind playing tricks on me. I went back to my bed room to try
and go back to sleep and heard someone talking in the next room. I started
to get a little bit scared at this time so I got my shotgun off the wall
and went into the next room only to find no one there. I spent most of
that night just sitting in my bed with no sleep. when I told my parents
the next day they said that my imagination was just running wild with me.A
couple of weeks later my older sister was telling my mother that she had
heard a baby crying the night before. Also a nephew of mine was asking
his mother who the man was that was standing there looking at him.There
wasn't anyone there. In 1974 I joined the US Army for two years mostly
to get away from that house. I got out of the service in 1976 and came
back home hoping that things might be different,they were not. My first
night home I had this crazy feeling that someone was watching me everywhere
I went.I was out in the yard about ready to go into the house when I looked
at the window of my bedroom and saw a man sitting in a chair staring at
me. That was the straw that broke the camels back. I packed up and moved
out that day. Two years later my folks sold there country store and moved
to a newer less inhabited home.</b>

<p><b>A Kitty Story</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: oblivion@alliedcom.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>I'm not sure if this exactly fits the criteria of a "ghost" story
but it was</b>
<br><b>rather odd anyway.&nbsp; I had befriended a stray kitten when I
lived in the</b>
<br><b>barracks at Columbus AFB, and later took her with me when I met
the man who</b>
<br><b>was to become my ex-husband (hee hee) and got married and such.&nbsp;
When I was</b>
<br><b>pregnant with my first daughter, my cat got pregnant too, and about
6 weeks</b>
<br><b>before my first daughter was born, the cat gave birth to a litter
of 4.&nbsp; One</b>
<br><b>was female and the most odd but lovely and prissy thing, with penetrating</b>
<br><b>eyes that were so yellow a vet who specialized in cats said, "Wow,
she's got</b>
<br><b>some yellow eyes!"&nbsp; I named her of all things Acid Trip because
she would</b>
<br><b>hop up and down on a depression left from a missing button on a
chair, as if</b>
<br><b>she were "tripping".</b>
<br><b>I ended up leaving the air force and my husband joined the army
and we moved</b>
<br><b>to several places.&nbsp; One place was Killeen TX by Fort Hood,
a place I utterly</b>
<br><b>despise mainly because of the muggy climate and flat terrain.&nbsp;
I had some</b>
<br><b>very wicked neighbors who I am sure killed my Acid Trip.&nbsp; On
Labor Day</b>
<br><b>weekend she didn't come home, and I figured she was on some kitty
adventure,</b>
<br><b>since she was fond of doing so once or twice per year.&nbsp; But
my other cats</b>
<br><b>would not leave the porch that weekend, which I thought odd.&nbsp;
The night</b>
<br><b>before the holiday it had rained but the next day was sunny so I
intended to</b>
<br><b>dump out the rainwater from the kids' swimming pool, clean it, and
put fresh</b>
<br><b>water in for them to play in.&nbsp; It was pretty heavy to tip over
so I had to</b>
<br><b>dig my feet in.&nbsp; Ants kept biting my toes, and when I looked
down to brush</b>
<br><b>them off there was my Acid Trip, dead, headfirst in a plastic toy
bucket and</b>
<br><b>shoved under the pool!&nbsp; Meanwhile those wicked neighbors were
outside</b>
<br><b>watching and having a good laugh when I screamed and ran into the
house.&nbsp; My</b>
<br><b>eyes are stinging right now because I loved that cat as if I were
her</b>
<br><b>grandmother (as I had raised her mother from a kitten).</b>
<br><b>We ended up burying her in the front yard under a shade tree.&nbsp;
Fast forward</b>
<br><b>a year, and my husband was stationed in Korea so it was just me
and the</b>
<br><b>girls.&nbsp; A friend of mine was in the process of leaving her
dipswitch husband</b>
<br><b>and needed a place to stay for a little while until she had a new
place.</b>
<br><b>She is a Wiccan and had a cat of her own as a familiar.&nbsp; One
night I drove</b>
<br><b>home from a store and saw a dead cat in the road....it was dark
and I</b>
<br><b>couldn't see it well, but I was positive it was her cat.&nbsp; I
parked the car</b>
<br><b>and sure enough, it was =(&nbsp; So I brought her in and laid her
out with some</b>
<br><b>flowers on an altar in the back yard and when my friend came home
I broke</b>
<br><b>the bad news to her and let her have some time with her kitty.&nbsp;
The next day</b>
<br><b>she asked me to bury her in the front yard in her favorite sunning
spot,</b>
<br><b>which was clearly marked by flattened grass.&nbsp; I picked up a
shovel and began</b>
<br><b>to dig when out came a cat skull!&nbsp; It literally popped out,
and not even a</b>
<br><b>single vertebra came with it!&nbsp; I realized that this was the
exact spot where</b>
<br><b>Acid Trip was buried EXACTLY ONE YEAR EARLIER.&nbsp; There was even
a patch of</b>
<br><b>fur clinging to the skull that was her color, so I was sure it was
her.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>figured she was sick of being in the ground and wanted to get out.</b>
<br><b>You may find this gross but I cleaned out her skull and bleached
it white</b>
<br><b>and have kept it on my altar no matter where I have moved since
then.&nbsp; I've</b>
<br><b>had other cats and none of them has ever come to any sort of harm
or illness</b>
<br><b>since.</b>

<p><b>A Loving Ghost</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: FriedChcknAttack@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>Ok, just a couple a week ago I was staying at my girlfriend's house.
She came</b>
<br><b>down earlier this summer, so I decided to visit her again for a
week before</b>
<br><b>school started. She's great. Anyway, I wont get into all that, 'cause
I know</b>
<br><b>that nobody wants to here about relationships and stuff... hahaha.
Anyway,</b>
<br><b>I've had experience with ghosts periodically since I was a young'n.
When I</b>
<br><b>stayed at my grandparent's house while I was a child and my parents
were</b>
<br><b>seprated I had some experiences. I remember hearing someone walk
up the</b>
<br><b>hallway and I would look at the doorway from my bed expecting to
see my mom,</b>
<br><b>but seeing nothing as the floorboards in front of my room creaked.
I was</b>
<br><b>kinda of freaked, but not too bad, oddly. But that's tame compared
to what</b>
<br><b>happened while I was at my Keshia's (My girlfriend). The first night
nothing</b>
<br><b>happened since there were other people in the living room sleeping
too... it</b>
<br><b>only seemed to happen when I was alone. I assume it was a friendly
ghost</b>
<br><b>though... but it still scared me to death. Ok, enough BS, I'll tell
what</b>
<br><b>happened. The second night I was there I had to sleep in the living
room...</b>
<br><b>you know the deal, her grandparent's (She lives with them instead
of her mom)</b>
<br><b>wanted me to sleep out there since they didn't really know me. Well,
after</b>
<br><b>Keshia kissed me goodnight and went down the hall to her bedroom
(About 20</b>
<br><b>feet), I started going to sleep... but was awakened when I felt
something</b>
<br><b>touching me. It was touching me exactly how Keshia had been touching
me</b>
<br><b>earlier. Like, running it's hands over me. It was unsettling, of
course, and</b>
<br><b>I tried to ignore it... until it started saying stuff. It was repeating
stuff</b>
<br><b>that Keshia had said to me earlier. Whispering just how she had
been. It was</b>
<br><b>repeating sweet things that she said to me... and it was right in
my ear. I</b>
<br><b>mean, as if it was right next to my ear. I thought "ALRIGHT" and
got up and</b>
<br><b>speed walked into Keshia's room. She had told me about an experience
after a</b>
<br><b>ghost had hugged her while she was sleeping, and if anything like
that</b>
<br><b>happened and I got scared, I could come into her room. So I went
in there sat</b>
<br><b>on her bed (This is about 15 minutes after she went to bed) and
said "Keshia,</b>
<br><b>Keshia, there's something out there bothering me" and told her,
stuttering,</b>
<br><b>what happened. I get panicky like that. Hehe. Anyway, I layed in
her bed for</b>
<br><b>a few minutes, and then she held my hand and we prayed to God about
it since</b>
<br><b>we're Christian and all. Then I had to go back out there and try
to get to</b>
<br><b>sleep... it still happened somewhat, but I was feeling better, and
I got to</b>
<br><b>sleep after about 45 minutes. The same thing happened the next night
too, but</b>
<br><b>I just layed down and concentrated on going to sleep. I slept alright
that</b>
<br><b>time. I guess it was trying to comfort me, or make me feel better,
by doing</b>
<br><b>and saying the things that Keshia had done and said. But it wasn't
very</b>
<br><b>comforting... hehe. The next 5 days, I slept in bed with her. Her</b>
<br><b>grandparent's let me, cause they trusted me and knew about the ghost
too.</b>
<br><b>Nothing happened while I was with Keshia. I slept well and comfortable
after</b>
<br><b>that. She said she heard footsteps in her hallway, but I didn't
hear them...</b>
<br><b>I believed her, of course. One time I went to get water though it
felt like</b>
<br><b>something was following me, then it felt like something had jumped
on my back</b>
<br><b>playfully. I got scared, turned around, and jogged back to her room
(Trying</b>
<br><b>not to wake anyone else up) and as I went back it felt like something
was</b>
<br><b>pushing me. Hehe... freaked me out bad, and it freaked her out too.
We just</b>
<br><b>hung out in her room at night and walked together when we needed
water or</b>
<br><b>pop. I guess the ghost liked me... it seemed to. But I was pretty
scared by</b>
<br><b>it. Although, now that I think about it, it seems like a pretty
cool ghost.</b>
<br><b>I'll see it again, I'm sure, and if anything else happens, I'll
send the in.</b><b></b>

<p><b>I learned about my personal spirit guide from a medium I met on the</b>

the</b>
<br><b>Civil War I call him my sentry. I have had a couple experiences
with him</b>
<br><b>I'd like to share with you. One night I was on my comuter that I
had</b>
<br><b>before it shut down on me (thats a story with no meaning to this)</b>
<br><b>anyways I was typing away on my keyboard just before midnight all
of a</b>
<br><b>sudden I see a blue mist on my shoulder it really freaked me out
at 1st</b>
<br><b>but then I talked to my medium friend about it and she said it was
my</b>
<br><b>spirit guide Arron touching me on the shoulder. Another night I
was all</b>
<br><b>alone in my room it was just after 1am I was really bored not really</b>
<br><b>doing anything except reading to see if anything was on tv. For
no</b>
<br><b>reason at all I look up at the celing and thier are small twinkling</b>
<br><b>lights all around me that fade away slowly after a few moments.
I</b>
<br><b>suspect this was Arron again beaucse I diddnt feel very afraid as
I</b>
<br><b>usually do with this sort of thing. I wasnt drinking or anything
like</b>
<br><b>that on either of theese occasions. I also have many deja vu experiences</b>

<p><b>A Recent Experience I Had</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: jhtown@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Recently I went on my first ghost hunt.&nbsp; I went to a</b>
<br><b>small remote cemetary in LaRue County, Kentucky.&nbsp; It</b>
<br><b>was off a small country road, right next to a corn</b>
<br><b>field.&nbsp; There are NO street lamps near by and no</b>
<br><b>houses.&nbsp; Nothing around to give off any light, other</b>
<br><b>than the moon.</b>
<br><b>We got there just before dark, to walk around a little</b>
<br><b>bit and get familiar with the land before it got dark.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;After about 30 minutes there, I got my camera and</b>
<br><b>camcorder out and started filming and taking pictures.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; I wasn't out there for 15 minutes and my battery on</b>
<br><b>my camcorder went out.&nbsp; I made sure I had a fully</b>
<br><b>battery and on a full battery, we can normally film</b>
<br><b>for about 90 minutes.</b>
<br><b>When we got home to watch the tape this is what we</b>
<br><b>saw.&nbsp; I first started recording there was still a</b>
<br><b>little day light left.&nbsp; I had focused in on one grave</b>
<br><b>that I felt had alot of energy, as soon as I pointed</b>
<br><b>toward the grave, you see an orb shoot strait from the</b>
<br><b>ground up into the trees.&nbsp; Caught several orbs on</b>
<br><b>video tape.&nbsp; Well, the tombstone that had the</b>
<br><b>activity, I sensed, I walked over and told her that I</b>
<br><b>was going to place my camcorder on her marker, invited</b>
<br><b>her to show herself or say anything she wanted to.</b>
<br><b>After a couple of minutes my sister in law goes and</b>
<br><b>gets my camcorder and makes a comment that we need to</b>
<br><b>come back and get her marker up off the ground and sit</b>
<br><b>it upright, immediately after that comment, you can</b>
<br><b>hear "yeah".&nbsp;&nbsp; It was not any of us there, it was a</b>
<br><b>totally different voice.</b>
<br><b>Now for the big part.&nbsp; The night was clear.&nbsp; There was</b>
<br><b>a bright moon, so we were not using flash lights.</b>
<br><b>Again, there was nothing around that would illuminate</b>
<br><b>light other than the moon.&nbsp; I placed my camcorder on</b>
<br><b>another tomb.&nbsp; At this point, it was totally dark, so</b>
<br><b>only thing we would be able to see was orbs.&nbsp; After</b>
<br><b>about 2 minutes sitting there, you see a red orb</b>
<br><b>appear and quickly disappear.&nbsp; About 30 seconds</b>
<br><b>elapse, one of us took a photograph, in the brief</b>
<br><b>seconds of the camera flash, you can see in the light</b>
<br><b>a black figure standing there.&nbsp; Not 10 seconds after</b>
<br><b>that, the orb appears again, on the tape, really</b>
<br><b>bright, then starts to fade, before it fades</b>
<br><b>completely out, that is when the batteries went out on</b>
<br><b>my camcorder.</b>
<br><b>As far as the black figure goes, I went back the next</b>
<br><b>night during the day, there were no statues on a</b>
<br><b>gravesite anywhere here.&nbsp; I thought that was what it</b>
<br><b>might have been when I saw the tape, but none was</b>
<br><b>there in the cemetary.&nbsp; Once it got dark again, I got</b>
<br><b>my camcorder out, again a full battery, this time not</b>
<br><b>5 minutes go by and the battery goes dead.</b>
<br><b>I got some pretty good photos I will email to you when</b>
<br><b>I can get them scanned.&nbsp; Several orbs, one red,</b>
<br><b>similar to the one that appeared on my video before</b>
<br><b>the battery went out.&nbsp; Also got on a picture what</b>
<br><b>seems to be the early stages of an ecto cloud.</b>
<br><b>This was my first time and experience going on a ghost</b>
<br><b>hunt, not bad for a beginner huh?</b>
<br><b>Love the site, keep up the good work.</b>

<p><b>Janice's ghost</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:lvenables@sympatico.ca</b><b></b>
<p><b>When I was 5 years old, my parents moved into a 75 year old home.
I still don't know very much about the history of this house. It was built
by a minister and sometime during the 1940's a summer kitchen was added
onto the back. We found many interesting and old things in the basement
and buried in the garden (not dead bodies or anything gruesome like that).&nbsp;
Anyway, this place has a strong presence within it. The house had once
been a boarding house. So I'm not too surprised about it having a strong
presence in it since many people lived there and possibly died there over
the years. Both my younger sister and I felt like we were being watched
when we were playing, alone in our rooms. Now when we talk about the house
we find it amazing that we felt 'creeped-out'&nbsp; in the same spots throughout
the place. My room, the basement, the attic and for awhile the summer kitchen
(which was a our playroom and later the family room) were places that were
particularly strong. I had two 'imaginary' friends, who I really don't
remember very well anymore (as I'm now 30 years old), but sometimes ''they'
convinced me to do stuff that got me in trouble.</b>
<br><b>There were two names scratched in two windows of the house. 'Mary
1920' was in the front room window and 'Elizabeth 1920'&nbsp; was scratched
on the window upstairs in my parents room. Years later an elderly woman
knocked on our door and ask if she could look inside the house. She claimed
to be 'Mary' and that 'Elizabeth'&nbsp; was her best friend who had lived
here.</b>
<br><b>After we sold the house, my mom bumped into the woman who bought
it. She was living there with her two children, both between 10-15 years
of age. Her daughter slept in my old bedroom. This lady told my mom that
her daughter has seen the ghost of a small, blonde girl in my room on 2
or 3 different occasions. The girl is pointing towards my parents old bedroom.
Oddly, before we moved we had replacement window installed throughout the
house, including the one with 'Elizabeth 1920' scratched on it. Only 'Mary's'
window remains, as it is part of a beautiful stained-glass window. Could
this ghost have been little Elizabeth asking were her window is? Needless
to say I found out that the house went up for sale a few months ago.</b>
<br><b>Now after telling you all this, I have to say that my ghost experience
has nothing to do with a ghost of the house or of the distant past. I do
think that the house made it possible for me to see this ghost, because
I haven't really experienced the strong presence or the any other ghost
activity anywhere else. Well, okay I have, but not as intense as I did
in that old house. Here's my story:</b>
<br><b>It happened when I was around 5 or 6 years old. My sister, a baby
then shared my room. She was still in a crib. One night I woke up and looked
over towards my bedroom door. I was froze with fear as I watched it slowly
open. My sister was awake, I think, but not crying or fussing, so I knew
it wasn't my mom or dad. I watched, paralyzed as a woman came into the
room . She had long blonde hair and was wearing blue satin-like shorts
and a pink t-shirt of the same material (it was cheap imitation of satin,
popular in the '70s). I could see through her. I remember being amazed
at being able to see the pattern of the wallpaper clearly through her.
She walked, slowly over to my sister's crib and looked in. Then she turned
and walked toward me. I was terrified. She had no face, it was all dark
like someone smudged out a face in a photo with black stuff. She stretched
out her arms. I noticed with increasing horror she had very long, red finger
nails. Being so frightened I did the only thing a 5 or 6 year could do.
I pulled the covers over my head. When I gather the courage to pull them
back down she was gone.</b>
<br><b>Later on I would discover that my aunt Janice had died in a car
accident around the time I saw this ghost. The accident was a suspected
suicide. Her husband was a drug addict and an alcoholic, as was she, plus
she had a toddler who was born with cerebral palsy due to her addictions.
Had she come to say good-bye to her nieces? My parents were the only ones
who really showed her any sympathy. Was she trying see to it that her son
would be taken care of? I really don't know. I wish I hadn't been so scared,
because I would have asked her.</b><b></b>

Arabia and Jordan.</b>
<br><b>One late morning, my grandmother knocked on our little town house
at 2:30 a.m As she walked in with apparent panic, all of our house hold
started to wake up. she was talking with almost no breath about her neighbor's
house being haunted.</b>
<br><b>earlier that night, allegedly, my grandmother's neighbor knocked
on her door to tell her that there was some abnormal things going on at
her house, she had just returned from a 5 minute visit to discover that
her house (which she always thought was haunted) in fact, was.</b>
<br><b>being the oldest (13 years old)&nbsp; - my mom grabbed my hand and
proceeded to walk to the house, it was only 4 blocks away.</b>
<br><b>once we walked in, things were obviously not right. I remember very
clearly observing the changes. the living room furniture all moved (including
the rug) into one pile to the corner of the living room.</b>
<br><b>a trail of Tied (powder detergent) connected the bathroom to the
kitchen. once we walked into the kitchen, we saw that all the powder detergents
was poured into the butter jar and returned to its place in the bathroom..</b>
<br><b>the stove burners were all lit and the pot that was cooking on the
stove was moved very carefully to the ground..</b>
<br><b>my mom freaked out and we left the house immediately...</b>
<br><b>keep in mind that my grandma and her friend has seen a transparent
man with a big hat walking down the stairs while reading a book several
times at that very same house before the incident. the house was sold and

over this hill and saw a fire glowing bright and decided to check it out.&nbsp;
As they walked closer they heard strange chantings they sounded almost
Druid.&nbsp; As they got even closer they saw that the people chanting
were wearing cloaks and were performing what looked like animal sacrifices.&nbsp;
One of the guys my friends was with stepped on something that snapped and
one of the cloaked people turned and seemed enraged.&nbsp; The turned and
made a run for it all the while never looking back but hearing them behind
them all the way to their cars.&nbsp; They got to their cars and haven't
been back since.&nbsp; There's a family that lives close to this river
who are involved with some kind of satanic worship.&nbsp; They used to
go to church with my parents and then they stopped going.&nbsp; Now they
live in this old shack and that's where are the occult people go for seances.&nbsp;
I know a few people who have been to them.</b><b></b>

<p><b>A Visit From Howark</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: sdjas@theramp.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was the summer between my junior and senior
year.&nbsp; I lived by</b>
<br><b>myself in a small town called Savannah Missuori.&nbsp; My parents
had moved</b>
<br><b>to the Peoria Illinois area for business reasons.&nbsp; I did not
want to</b>
<br><b>move because I didnt want to start a new school my senior year,
so my</b>
<br><b>parents left me the house.&nbsp; My best frien was catholic and
we decided to</b>
<br><b>never play around with ouija boards or any type of "evil" practices.</b>
<br><b>But the temptation for me was too much.&nbsp; A group of kids that
I worked</b>
<br><b>with were into contacting ghosts and such.&nbsp; One of them even
sweared to</b>
<br><b>be a medium.&nbsp; So one day me and a friend went and bought a
ouija board.</b>
<br><b>It was a glow in the dark one by Parker Brothers, so we thought
it was</b>
<br><b>just a joke.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later that night me, my friend Nate, and my other
friend Merissa,</b>
<br><b>decided to play around with the board at Nate's house.&nbsp; The
night was</b>
<br><b>fairly uneventful, but we did talk to a few spirits.&nbsp; We had
read guide</b>
<br><b>books so we knew not to ask anyone (or thing) to prove its self.</b>
<br><b>Never-the-less, it was a very thrilling night.&nbsp; I had never
done</b>
<br><b>anything like this before.&nbsp; I grew up in a christian home so
I believed</b>
<br><b>these kind of practices to be wrong.&nbsp; So the next day at work
me and</b>
<br><b>Nate told our friend Joel about the experience.&nbsp; He laughed
at us, so we</b>
<br><b>told him we would prove it to him later that night.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Night came so we set up the ouija at nates house
again.&nbsp; Joel didnt</b>
<br><b>want to play, but he said he would watch.&nbsp; So me and Nate took
our</b>
<br><b>positions at opposite ends of the board.&nbsp; Joel asked us to
see if the</b>
<br><b>board would contact his grandmother.&nbsp; So we asked, and the
board said it</b>
<br><b>was his grandmother.&nbsp; Joel not believing this asked us to ask
for a</b>
<br><b>name.&nbsp; Neither me or Nate knowing Joels grandmothers name were
surprised</b>
<br><b>when the board spelled it out.&nbsp; This got Joel's attention a
little bit</b>
<br><b>more.&nbsp; Than Joel started asking it questions, it was answering
but only</b>
<br><b>in bits and letters, it didnt seem to like vowels.&nbsp; We had
written down</b>
<br><b>everything said but we could not make any sense of it, the board
said it</b>
<br><b>loved Joel and to watch after his mother.&nbsp; This sent Joel into
tears.</b>
<br><b>But this is not the worse part.&nbsp; The next moring Joel came
over and told</b>
<br><b>us his mother and father were getting a divorce, when we reviewed
the</b>
<br><b>sheet with what was said, we were able to make that out of the</b>
<br><b>conversation.&nbsp; The board also kept on refering to Joel's mother
as NO-Z</b>
<br><b>going from the "NO" to the letter "Z" on the board.&nbsp; Joels
mother had</b>
<br><b>said that was her mothers nick name for her.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After what had happened with Joel I became hooked
on the board.&nbsp; One</b>
<br><b>night at my place I had some friends over, while most of them were</b>
<br><b>downstairs watching a movie, me, a friend named John, and Merissa,</b>
<br><b>deicided to go play the ouija in my little brothers old room (now</b>
<br><b>converted into a guitar room).&nbsp; We set up with a candle and
all.&nbsp; It was</b>
<br><b>a very dark and creepy setting.&nbsp; Just right for a "ghost talk."&nbsp;
At</b>
<br><b>first John wasnt serious so we had problems talking but after awhile
it</b>
<br><b>was very easy to communicate with the other side.&nbsp; Finally
we got a</b>
<br><b>visiter thats vibe was very strong.&nbsp; I asked what its name
was, it</b>
<br><b>replied "Howark."&nbsp; I than asked where it was from, it said
"Below"</b>
<br><b>(accually it spelled out "B" "L" "O").&nbsp; Since I was young I
was told</b>
<br><b>only demons talk to you on ouija boards, so I asked are you a Demon.</b>
<br><b>Its answer was not what we had expected, the pointer circled around
the</b>
<br><b>board twice and than violently/quickly slid off the side of the
board.</b>
<br><b>Me and my friend were startled by this, we just sat there for about
a</b>
<br><b>minute in silence.&nbsp; Than I heard a sigh, it sounded like it
came over my</b>
<br><b>right shoulder but i wasnt sure if I had just made it up.&nbsp;
I asked them</b>
<br><b>if they had heard it, they said yes but none of them claimed it.&nbsp;
So all</b>
<br><b>at once we got up and ran out of the room.&nbsp; We all swear it
came from</b>
<br><b>behind us, but this would have been impossible for we were sitting
in a</b>
<br><b>trianlge shape.&nbsp; So the rest of the night the rest of the people
at my</b>
<br><b>house just laughed at us for running downstairs.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ok, nothing really happened at first, so I will
skip a head a couple</b>
<br><b>of weeks.&nbsp; I had just got back from visiting my parents and
was falling</b>
<br><b>asleep one night, when i was awoke from a sound of a grandfather
clock,</b>
<br><b>this really didnt bother me because my parents had one.&nbsp; It
was not till</b>
<br><b>the next moring that I realized i was no longer at my parents house,
and</b>
<br><b>that the sound had came across the hall form my guitar room where
the</b>
<br><b>ouija was played.&nbsp; The noise made was more than likely somthing
striking</b>
<br><b>my bass guitar and turning on the amp.&nbsp; Ok, that is wierd.&nbsp;
At the end</b>
<br><b>of that week my little brother and a friend from Illinois came and</b>
<br><b>stayed with me for a few days.&nbsp; One night we were all in the
upstairs</b>
<br><b>living room playing video games when i got hungry and asked my little</b>
<br><b>brother to go make me a bowl of cerial, he said ok, after he was
done</b>
<br><b>playing his game with his friend.&nbsp; So, not wanting to wait
around until</b>
<br><b>he was done playing, I went into my room and laid down on my bed.&nbsp;
I</b>
<br><b>waited for what seemed like hours waiting for the cerial, but i</b>
<br><b>eventually went to sleep.&nbsp; I than awoke at about 2 in the morning</b>
<br><b>hearing footsteps coming from the family room upstairs.&nbsp; They
were very</b>
<br><b>slow foot steps that were very annoying.&nbsp; I thought it was
my little</b>
<br><b>brother and his friend just screwing around so I went back to sleep.&nbsp;
So</b>
<br><b>the next morning I got up and went down stairs and asked my little
bro</b>
<br><b>why he hadnt fixed me any cerial.&nbsp; He said he had and had tried
to give</b>
<br><b>it to me 10 minutes after i went into my room.&nbsp; I told him
he was lying</b>
<br><b>for I had been waiting for the cerial for like an hour before I
went to</b>
<br><b>sleep.&nbsp; He said he came into my room and I told him to go away
before I</b>
<br><b>hurt him.&nbsp; I dont remember saying that, so I thought he was
just saying</b>
<br><b>that to make it seem like he had tried to give me the cerial.&nbsp;
But there</b>
<br><b>was a bowl of cerial made, it was on the kitchen counter all soggy
from</b>
<br><b>being in milk all night.&nbsp; So he had made the cerial.&nbsp;
So than I asked</b>
<br><b>him why he and his friend were up walking around the family room
all</b>
<br><b>night.&nbsp; He said his friend and him had gone down stairs at
about 11:30</b>
<br><b>to play on the computer and were down there all night.&nbsp; I still
didnt</b>
<br><b>think anything about Howark or the ouija board.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After my little bro went home me and some friends
were hanging out</b>
<br><b>in my family room upstairs, when we heard something that sounded
like</b>
<br><b>chains scratching coming from the guitar room.&nbsp; This freaked
them out</b>
<br><b>and Merissa started to get violent, she said she felt something
so most</b>
<br><b>of the people left for the night.&nbsp; After this I started to
realize I had</b>
<br><b>invited something aweful into my home.&nbsp; It scared me, everytime
I went</b>
<br><b>by that room I got a chill feeling.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After awhile the light in that room liked to
just come on by</b>
<br><b>itself.&nbsp; It never went off, only on.&nbsp; This really didnt
bother me</b>
<br><b>because I wasnt getting hurt by anything.&nbsp; Of course I was
uncomfortable</b>
<br><b>knowing something beyond my control was happening but I was not
really</b>
<br><b>all that frieghtened.&nbsp; Until one day my best friend Chris (the
catholic)</b>
<br><b>came over.&nbsp; We were down stairs playing on the computer until
we decided</b>
<br><b>to go upstairs and play the bass.&nbsp; Now, know that Chris did
not know</b>
<br><b>anything about the ouija board incident.&nbsp; As soon as Chris
entered the</b>
<br><b>room the hairs on the back of his neck stood up, he got very pale,
and</b>
<br><b>than commented that he was ill.&nbsp; I told him about the incident,
and he</b>
<br><b>than immediately requested to leave the house.&nbsp; As we were
out driving</b>
<br><b>around thinking about what had happened Chris told me about one
night he</b>
<br><b>came by and sworne I was up in that room but I wasnt home.&nbsp;
This freaked</b>
<br><b>me out.&nbsp; The next few days Chris would barely come in my house,
so we</b>
<br><b>decided to go to the church and get some holy water.&nbsp; We than
tried to</b>
<br><b>bless the room but it was very weird, Chris was ill at ease, looking</b>
<br><b>very scared, and I did not want to be in that room.&nbsp; So that
night I</b>
<br><b>spent the night at Chris's house.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later that week me and Chris were downstairs
playing on the computer</b>
<br><b>when we saw a shadow down the stairway from the light of the guitar</b>
<br><b>room.&nbsp; It was of a person and it just dissapeared as soon as
we looked.</b>
<br><b>But we both saw it.&nbsp; We were so scared that we ran from the
house.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>did not live in that town for more than a week after that (not really</b>
<br><b>'cause of the ghost, but because I couldnt afford rent).&nbsp; For
the next</b>
<br><b>week I stayed with Chris until I moved to Illinois with my parents.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A week after I moved my parents went back to
the house to retrieve</b>
<br><b>some of my stuff.&nbsp; I stayed in Illinois watching my little
brother, but</b>
<br><b>one day I got a call from my mom from Missouri.&nbsp; Apparently
my mother</b>
<br><b>had gotten ill, and afraid after entering the room.&nbsp; Something
similar</b>
<br><b>had happened to my father to.&nbsp; I had to tell my parents about
the ouija</b>
<br><b>board incident.&nbsp; I didnt want to tell them because of their
beliefs, but</b>
<br><b>I did because of all that had happened.&nbsp; My parents than had
a priest</b>
<br><b>come and bless the room.&nbsp; The priest told my parents he felt
something</b>
<br><b>evil in that room and he put a cross in every corner and over the
door.</b>
<br><b>He than opened the window and leanded in the center of the room,
closed</b>
<br><b>his eyes, and prayed.&nbsp; He said he felt an immense heat and
a scream as</b>
<br><b>something left the house through the window.&nbsp; That is the last
I know</b>
<br><b>about the ghost (or demon) named Howark.&nbsp; I hope it is the
last.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One interesting note.&nbsp; My parents sold the
house to a realiestate</b>
<br><b>agency.&nbsp; It is a nice house, only about 9 years old.&nbsp;
When I went back</b>
<br><b>to visit my friend a year later, the house still had not been sold.</b><b></b>

<p><b>The Native Spirit</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: darwin_fishie@hotmail.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>About five years ago (I was 13), my family went to Colorado for vacation.</b>
<br><b>We stayed in a little motel about three or four miles from Pike's
Peak (a</b>
<br><b>beautiful place, I might add).&nbsp; As you can imagine, there were
many Native</b>
<br><b>Americans and Mexicans that lived there.</b>
<br><b>One day, we went to the Garden of the Gods and were walking around
the rock</b>
<br><b>formations there.&nbsp; I wandered off a bit from my family and
went off one of</b>
<br><b>the trails and behind a rock to get a good picture of the Kissing
Camels</b>
<br><b>(another rocks formation).&nbsp; It was pretty warm out, but when
I turned the</b>
<br><b>corner, I started to shiver a bit.&nbsp; I didn't think anything
of it really.</b>
<br><b>However, about five yards from me (in view of my camera), was a
tall Native</b>
<br><b>man.&nbsp; He looked to be in his twenties and was dressed in nondescript</b>
<br><b>clothing.&nbsp; What caught my eye was that he had a feather (I
think eagle) tied</b>
<br><b>in his hair (which was very long).&nbsp; I made eye contact with
him and he</b>
<br><b>smiled at me.&nbsp; I smiled back. He moved off to the side so I
could take the</b>
<br><b>picture, but even then, he was still in the view of the camera.&nbsp;
I decided</b>
<br><b>to go ahead and take the picture with him in it.</b>
<br><b>After I took the picture, my sister came up behind me.&nbsp; I turned
for less</b>
<br><b>than a second to see her and when I turned back around, the man
was gone.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>asked my sister if she had seen anyone and she said she hadn't.&nbsp;
I felt that</b>
<br><b>was a little strange, because there was no place for someone to
duck out of</b>
<br><b>sight in an instant.&nbsp; About a week later, I got those pictures
developed.</b>
<br><b>In the one I took of the Kissing Camels, the man is nowhere to be
seen.</b>
<br><b>A few years later, I stumble across a brief history of the Garden
of the</b>
<br><b>Gods.&nbsp; What is really strange is that nowhere in it does it
make mention of</b>
<br><b>Natives.&nbsp; It was established during teh time of the railroad
races and</b>
<br><b>originally as a beer garden.&nbsp; I mentioned this to a friend
of mine, who is</b>
<br><b>heavily into spirits, and he said that it didn't mean a thing.&nbsp;
The man I</b>
<br><b>saw could have been killed at any point of history and that seeing
a Native</b>
<br><b>spirit did not mean an Indian battle took place or that it was a
burial</b>
<br><b>ground or something.&nbsp; I'm still not sure exactly what it was
that I saw.&nbsp; It</b>
<br><b>wasn't frightening at all, jsut strange.</b><b></b>

<br><b>And Yet Another Ghost Story or Two....</b>
<br><b>By: b.kaspers@home.nl</b><b></b>
<p><b>Good Evening......</b>
<br><b>Here's some more reading pleasure for you:</b>
<br><b>Story #1:</b>
<br><b>Where:&nbsp; Exton,&nbsp; Pennsylvania</b>
<br><b>My family lived in a house that seemed to have alot of activity.&nbsp;
It was purchased in 1977.&nbsp; Prior to my family living there, the house
had five other families move in and out in a seven year time span.&nbsp;
My mom does not scare easily,and that's just as well.....for a good number
of years, she used to see a silouette of a man in her peripheral vision.
Whenever she turned her head, he would vanish.&nbsp; She says he was dressed
in late 18th or early 19th cent. clothing.&nbsp; He never did anything
or appeared to be threatening in any way, so she wasn't bothered by him.&nbsp;
She didn't tell anyone in the family ("They're coming to take me away,
ha ha...!"). My little brother had a room at the other end of the upstairs,
just over the garage. One wall was an entire closet which had louver doors.&nbsp;
One night he woke up around three a.m. and ran&nbsp; down the hall screaming
,"THERE'S A MAN IN MY ROOM!!!!".&nbsp; Well, he never knew about the apparition
because mom never said anything. The man had been standing directly in
front of the louver doors.</b>
<br><b>I was there on a visit in 1982.&nbsp; My mom, my middle brother
and I were sitting in the den, at just about 11:30 p.m., watching "Monday
Night Football With Howard Cosell".&nbsp; Dad and younger brother had gone
to bed about 2 hours earlier.&nbsp; We were sitting on the couch.&nbsp;
Above our heads, on a huge plank, sat a very large sailing ship complete
with rigging.&nbsp; Just at 11:30 p.m. we all heard this tremendous '"BANG!!!!".&nbsp;
A upstairs door had been slammed so hard it made the ship rattle, and the
vibration was felt down the entire length of the den wall.&nbsp; We all
came up off the couch in unison!!&nbsp; My brother and&nbsp; I went upstairs
- not one single door to any of the rooms was closed. My dad and younger
brother never heard a thing and were both sound asleep.</b>
<br><b>I had a small dressing table light in my guest room.&nbsp; I turned
it on and went downstairs to the kitchen for a few minutes.&nbsp; Mom was
still up (it was almost midnight) and everyone else was long in bed.&nbsp;
When I returned to my room, the light was off.&nbsp; I thought the bulb
burned out, but it was simply off.&nbsp; I turned the switch and it came
on again.&nbsp; (Who turned it off?)</b>
<br><b>My middle brother was alone one afternoon with just the family dog,
Babe.&nbsp; She was outside on a very long line which allowed her to go
the length of the driveway and also into the backyard. Nobody got close
to the house unless they liked the sight of their own blood....My brother
heard three distinct raps on an outside wall (which was the inside wall
of the den).&nbsp; It was the middle of the afternoon. He went outside
to look and nobody was there.&nbsp; It didn't occur to him until later
that Babe never made a sound....and whoever knocked on the wall had to
have gotten past her first.</b>
<br><b>They sold the house in 1999 and haven't heard any complaints from
the new owners.</b>
<br><b>Where:&nbsp; Munstergeleen, South Limburg, Netherlands</b>
<br><b>This is about my house.&nbsp; My family and I bought this old farmhouse,
built in 1860, in late 1992.&nbsp; Prior to us, generations of the family
who originally built this house had lived here.&nbsp; We were the first
"strangers".&nbsp; (At the moment I am smelling something "burning" , but
it's the middle of summer and my computer is not on fire!)&nbsp; My husband,
who WAS a strict skeptic, used to hear footfalls in the rooms upstairs
while he was alone in the livingroom.&nbsp; On numerous occasions, our
ceiling light used to come on of it's own volition, but at 1/2 power -
like it was on a dimmer switch.&nbsp; The ceiling light in our son's room
did the same thing, but not at the same time.&nbsp; The switches didn't
work, so we had to take the bulbs out.&nbsp; Other days the lights were
just fine.&nbsp; We wondered if it was the wiring, but we've had no electrical
problems whatsoever.</b>
<br><b>In our livingroom, a corner of the floor can be removed. It's made
up of wooden slats and is an area about the size of the plastic floor stand
of a parrot cage.&nbsp; That's precisely what we set in that spot, because
we didn't want to put anything heavy on it. There is nothing under the
panel but cement, which if opened would lead to the basement (the mosquitoes
and spiders reside there.)&nbsp; The parrot cage would begin to visibly
and audibly shake. My china cabinet was right next to it, and it was completely
still. We had cockatiels at the time, and they had eyes like saucers while
this was going on. The two of them just looked down into the cage. The
toy bell was ringing and the cage shook rather violently.&nbsp; The first
time it happened my husband was home alone.&nbsp; The second time we were
both home.&nbsp; He said when he grabbed the cage, it just kept shaking!&nbsp;
My husband has an extremely strong grip, which didn't seem to matter at
the time.&nbsp; The second time, I grabbed the cage and it also continued
to shake.&nbsp; I got very annoyed and yelled out," Either show yourself
or go away - you're scaring my birds!!!!"&nbsp; The shaking stopped immediately
afterwards.</b>
<br><b>One afternoon at about 2:30 p.m. I heard footfalls coming down the
stairs.&nbsp; Our stairs make a distinct sound on every step.&nbsp; My
husband had night shift that week, and I thought he was coming down to
use the toilet.&nbsp; Our son was in school. The kitchen door was closed
(leads to the hall and the stairs) because I had the stereo on.&nbsp; I
thought I'd give him a big scare, so I waited on the other side of the
door., with my hand on the doorhandle.&nbsp; Just as I heard the last footfall,
I yanked open the door - NOBODY THERE.&nbsp; I went upstairs and looked
in the bedroom and he was fast asleep.&nbsp; It would have been impossible
for anyone to go up a set of stairs so quickly, so I just figured it was
"someone else".</b>
<br><b>I went to an automatic writer and she said there's a woman still
in this house looking for something - a letter from a loved one, perhaps.&nbsp;
A woman of the original family had died in the driveway in the 1930s. Her
daughter was born in this house and still lives across the street.</b>
<br><b>All of these stories are factual and can be verified by my family.</b>
<br><b>Thank You!</b><b></b>

<br><b>Animated inanimate objects, shadow people, etc.</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: denncbo@yahoo.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>I just want to start by saying I'm completely addicted to this site
- its</b>
<br><b>fabulous!!!</b>
<br><b>I have had several experiences in my life, staring as far back as
I can</b>
<br><b>remember.&nbsp; I was always interested in the paranormal.&nbsp;
I remember being very</b>
<br><b>little (like maybe 3 or 4) and talking to my grandmother (who we
- my mom</b>
<br><b>and I - lived with at the time) and wanting to talk about ghost
stories,</b>
<br><b>telling her I wanted to be a witch, etc.&nbsp; I was also terrified
of the devil</b>
<br><b>(I was raised Catholic, but was to young at that age to really be
in any</b>
<br><b>kind of way bombarded by any religious dogma of any type at all,
I wasn't</b>
<br><b>even in Sunday school).&nbsp; And please know that when I say terrified
I mean</b>
<br><b>pathologically, absolutely TERRIFIED.&nbsp; I remember a couple
of times in my</b>
<br><b>childhood, both at my grandparents house and at the house I spent
most of my</b>
<br><b>childhood in, from maybe the ages of 4 - 10, waking up at the top
of the</b>
<br><b>basement stairs with my mother slapping me across the face (to try
to wake</b>
<br><b>me as I was hysterical) - I guess I had sleep-walked there and apparently</b>
<br><b>was yelling down into the darkness at the devil).&nbsp; I remember
waking up, not</b>
<br><b>so much remembering the dream I was having, but I do remember that
upon</b>
<br><b>waking I'd sorta (as I was coming out of the sleep) hear myself
yelling,</b>
<br><b>"NO!&nbsp; NO!&nbsp; I HATE YOU!&nbsp; NO!" and I know I thought
I was yelling at the devil</b>
<br><b>himself.&nbsp; I also remember for years, when my parents weren't
around, I would</b>
<br><b>hear voices whispering (not really whispering, so much as I could
only hear</b>
<br><b>them in my head and therefore they really lacked physical volume)
my name.</b>
<br><b>And the whispering would come from distinct spots - usually a staircase</b>
<br><b>(didn't matter what house I was in, if I was upstairs the voice
would be</b>
<br><b>calling from downstairs, and vice versa).</b>
<br><b>I also remember (and this sticks in my mind so vividly to this day)
being</b>
<br><b>maybe 3 or 4, playing in an upstairs bedroom at my grandmothers
house with</b>
<br><b>this ceramic cat thing-y.&nbsp; It was maybe 2-2 1/2 inches long
and it was in</b>
<br><b>the shape of a black cat climbing/scrambling up something, its front
paws</b>
<br><b>were hooked so you could hook it to the top of a lamp shade - just
a</b>
<br><b>knick-knacky thing.&nbsp; Well, anyway, I was just a little girl,
singing to</b>
<br><b>myself in the afternoon in this bedroom, stroking the back of the
cat thing</b>
<br><b>with my finger (like I was "petting" it, for some reason until that
moment I</b>
<br><b>loved that cat thing-y) when it like became animated and kinda like</b>
<br><b>stretched out under my finger (just like a real cat would) and meowed.&nbsp;
I</b>
<br><b>ran downstairs to the kitchen and told Nanny (my grandmother) and
she told</b>
<br><b>me I was over tired or needed a nap or something.&nbsp; It was very
frustrating</b>
<br><b>because I KNOW I KNOW what I saw, I wasn't sleepy (I'm still very
unmovable</b>
<br><b>on that point, though now that I'm an adult I should be so lucky
to have</b>
<br><b>people trying to get me to take a nap :) ).&nbsp; I also had strange
dreams that</b>
<br><b>would come true, a lot more frequently when I was little (too numerous
and</b>
<br><b>uneventful to go into here).</b>
<br><b>Then one day in 5th grade a boy in my class did a book report on
a book from</b>
<br><b>the school library on true ghost stories.&nbsp; I had no idea such
things</b>
<br><b>existed!!!&nbsp; I read every book in the school library, then the
suburbs</b>
<br><b>library, and so on until eventually I started reading about the
occult.</b>
<br><b>I'll admit I was really stupid with the things I started to mess
with (I was</b>
<br><b>14 by now).&nbsp; My best friend and I got into witchcraft and would
do spells</b>
<br><b>(with strong results, but admittedly very irresponsible).&nbsp;
At this time at</b>
<br><b>my parents house (moved out of Nanny's when my mother re-married)
I started</b>
<br><b>to feel watched all the time.&nbsp; Especially in the basement when
I would watch</b>
<br><b>TV.&nbsp; It would always come from the darkest corner, back behind
the stairs</b>
<br><b>which were on the opposite wall as the TV.&nbsp; I would talk to
my friend on the</b>
<br><b>phone about it, and as soon as we started on that subject, my line
would go</b>
<br><b>all static-y, until we changed subjects - then it was fine.&nbsp;
I mean I really</b>
<br><b>felt watched ALL THE TIME, but in the basement it was a scary watched
feel,</b>
<br><b>like I was prey - a very evil feeling.&nbsp; I spoke to my religion
teacher (at</b>
<br><b>this point I was in a catholic school for high school) and she wanted
to</b>
<br><b>come out with an exorcist priest, but from what I'd read and heard
that'll</b>
<br><b>either fix it, or make it worse...&nbsp; that and I didn't really
want to talk to</b>
<br><b>my parents about it - though she even offered to arrange it when
my parents</b>
<br><b>were gonna be away.&nbsp; Anyway, I guess I just kinda lived with
it, I knew it</b>
<br><b>couldn't harm me, but I also knew it was watching me, waiting for
me to do</b>
<br><b>something to "slip up" (all though how I don't know) so I could
get to me</b>
<br><b>(or get me, asitwere).</b>
<br><b>From that point in my life on I see what I call the "Shadow People",&nbsp;
of</b>
<br><b>which I appear to not be alone as there's tons of mentions of them
on this</b>
<br><b>sight.&nbsp; Once a few months ago in the apartment I live in now
I saw for the</b>
<br><b>first time a reverse-shadow person (made out of like white instead
of</b>
<br><b>blackness, like the photo negative of a normal shadow person).&nbsp;
I almost</b>
<br><b>bumped into it rounding a corner and was so shocked I almost said
"excuse</b>
<br><b>me" before I realized what it was.</b>
<br><b>A woman was murdered in the building I live in (a 4 plex, so we're
all</b>
<br><b>pretty close together) and since then the electricity flickers,
things go</b>
<br><b>off and on, etc (a few nights ago the lights we're going off in
like a</b>
<br><b>circle - we have recessed lighting in the ceiling and one would
go off, I'd</b>
<br><b>try to ignore it, then it'd come back on and the one to the left
would go</b>
<br><b>out, come back on, then the one to the left of that -&nbsp; in a
clockwise</b>
<br><b>motion, to the point where I was just like "Oh for gods sake, all
right all</b>
<br><b>right - I know what's going on here" (I think she just wants the
attention</b>
<br><b>at this point - like she'll do stuff just to the point where you
can't</b>
<br><b>reason it away in your mind anymore, then she feels kinda satisfied).</b>
<br><b>Sorry this was so long, and I hope it wasn't to boring.&nbsp; The
ceramic cat</b>
<br><b>thing is the one that really to this day still "gets" me.&nbsp;
I guess I've</b>
<br><b>always wanted to see a ghost or to have something scary (although
I know I'd</b>
<br><b>be the first one running away screaming) happen - but seeing all
the stuff I</b>
<br><b>just wrote (and all the stuff I didn't) I guess I already have.</b>

<br><b>Small Home</b><b></b>

<p><b>When I was about 8-9 years old, my family rented a very small one-story</b>

The</b>

before or after</b>
<br><b>this event. Until I was in high school, I was afraid to tell anyone
about it</b>
<br><b>because I thought that something might happen to me if I did.</b>
<br><b>The experience is very simple.... I was entering my bedroom on night
and</b>
<br><b>stood in the doorway as a low, male voice from what seemed to be
the outside</b>
<br><b>of the screen said, "Let's see, you're number is eight".&nbsp; Immediately

<p><b>Haunted Basement</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Anonymous</b><b></b>
<p><b>There have been stories about paranormal happenings in the basement
of my fraternity house for as long as I can remember.&nbsp; In the 1970's
my fraternity hired a full-time cook named Dominic.&nbsp; The brothers
called him Dom for short.&nbsp; Dom was an older man and for many years
he got along well with the guys.&nbsp; At the time the kitchen was located
in the basement next to the large common room the brothers used to hang
out in and throw parties.&nbsp; One day while Dom was cooking, one of the
brothers heard a loud crash in the kitchen.&nbsp; He ran in to see what
was happening.&nbsp; Dom had had a heart attack and died on the floor of
the basement. A couple months later the fraternity was having a party in
the basement and Dom's granddaughter showed up.&nbsp; She was drunk and
was later raped by a man at the party in the kitchen (not one of the brothers).&nbsp;
One of the fraternity brothers walked in on this and put a stop to it but
the damage was already done.</b>
<br><b>Ever since that day strange things have been happening in the basement.&nbsp;
We all think that it is Dom angry for what happened to his granddaughter.&nbsp;
One night a bunch of us where sitting at the bar which is at the opposite
end of the basement as the kitchen.&nbsp; All the lights were off in basement
except for the one above the bar.&nbsp; So the rest of the basement was
pretty dark.&nbsp; As we were sitting at the bar I looked towards the kitchen
and I saw a shadow of a figure walking towards us.&nbsp; It walked past
a column and never came out the other side.&nbsp; I went to investigate
but found nothing and no one there.&nbsp; Later that night we heard a loud
noise in the kitchen.&nbsp; A couple of us went to check it out.&nbsp;
There was a broken plate in the middle of the floor and all of the cabinets
were open.&nbsp; No one could get to the kitchen with out walking past
us at the bar and there was no one in the kitchen.&nbsp; We all stood there
in awe but decided to just go back to the bar.&nbsp; About a half an hour
later we heard a loud crash at the other end of the basement.&nbsp; We
turned on the lights and there was another broken plate in the middle of
the floor.&nbsp; There were no tables or anything else that the plate could
have fallen off of in the area where it broke.&nbsp; We have no idea where
it came from.&nbsp; After that night whenever we were in the basement all
the lights were on and no one goes down there alone.</b>

<br><b>At the Window</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Anonymous</b><b></b>
<p><b>I was at my uncle's house one evening, and me and my brother were
staying the</b>
<br><b>night with him, our auntie and cousins, and I had to sleep in the
spare bed.</b>
<br><b>It was about seven at night, and my uncle and I were setting up
my room. The</b>
<br><b>window was open, and the curtains were half closed. It was a windy
night, and</b>
<br><b>all the trees were casting shadows over the house, and I was a bit
scared</b>
<br><b>about having to sleep in the spare room all alone. We were pulling
down the</b>
<br><b>sofa bed, and arranging my duvet, when my uncle looked up and froze.
He stood</b>
<br><b>in the middle of the room, staring out of the window in silence.
I panicked</b>
<br><b>and asked him what was wrong. He began to shake and I tried to pull
his hand</b>
<br><b>and see out of the window for myself, but she grabbed me and told
me "dont</b>
<br><b>look out of the window, whatever you do! DONT go to the window!"
but I</b>
<br><b>did-and now I wish that I hadnt. At the window was a boy. He was
white and</b>
<br><b>slightly green, glowing in the dark. He looked about six or seven,
and his</b>
<br><b>whispered something to me,I couldnt make out what though, and reached
out his</b>
<br><b>hand to my face. I screamed, and ran to my uncle. We both ran out
into the</b>
<br><b>hall, and stood there frozen in horror, and didnt go bck in there
till</b>
<br><b>morning.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This might not sound that scary, but I didnt
know how to tell you what</b>
<br><b>happened without sounding unrealistic and silly. It was definetly
the most</b>
<br><b>scary experience I've ever had in my life. Maybe there is a logical</b>

<br><b>Aunt and Uncles Luck</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: salivaryglands@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Sorry these are so long, but I cant wait to investigate their house
for my</b>
<br><b>grad school thesis!</b>
<br><b>My Aunt and Uncle seem to have the best luck in finding houses to
live in.</b>
<br><b>They have lived in 3 houses I believe, and all of them have been
haunted.</b>
<br><b>The day of my cousins 1st birthday my family trooped over to their
house to</b>
<br><b>celebrate.&nbsp; We were standing in their dining room, which Im
told was added</b>
<br><b>after the house was built.&nbsp; I had an uneasy feeling, but it
wasnt a bad</b>
<br><b>uneasy, almost a confused uneasy.&nbsp; My sister and I were standing
by the old</b>
<br><b>sideboard, my cousin was in her high chair, and my dad was standing
off to</b>
<br><b>the side of her.&nbsp; We all sang happy birthday to her, and I
watched as she</b>
<br><b>looked all around her, above her mostly, and then her eyes rested
on where</b>
<br><b>my Dad was standing.&nbsp; My sister grabbed my hand and at that
point I knew she</b>
<br><b>saw the orb that I saw.&nbsp; I dont even think my Dad saw it, let
alone the rest</b>
<br><b>of the party.&nbsp; Now my cousin didnt know how to even say mommy
yet, she was</b>
<br><b>quiet fluent in Daddy, but besides the point, she couldnt really
speak.</b>
<br><b>Plain as day, we all heard, "I love you Bob" (my dads name is bob)&nbsp;
Then she</b>
<br><b>started laughing and clapping all the while watching that orb float
around</b>
<br><b>the room.&nbsp; No one breathed.&nbsp; Then we erupted in woohoos
and the like.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>guess it doesnt sound like much of a "ghost experience" but this
should</b>
<br><b>help.</b>
<br><b>About a year later, I was talking to my Uncle and we were reminscing
about</b>
<br><b>that day, and he said that he had videotaped the event.&nbsp; He
said the really</b>
<br><b>weird part is that when she spoke, her mouth didnt move.</b>
<br><b>Since then, they have had many experiences such as, the tv coming
on when</b>
<br><b>its unplugged, dark shadows walking through walls, drastic temperature</b>
<br><b>changes, the electricity going out, but the computer staying on.&nbsp;
The most</b>
<br><b>recent story is this one my Uncle told me a couple weeks ago:</b>
<br><b>He was in the shower, on the 2nd floor and all of a sudden he heard,
"I see</b>
<br><b>you", some laughter, and then nothing.&nbsp; Well, he automatically
figured it</b>
<br><b>was his daughter, but then ruled her out because she wasnt home.&nbsp;
So he</b>
<br><b>figured it was his wife sitting in the dining room which was below
the</b>
<br><b>bathroom.&nbsp; The cats tend to jump up in the window down there,
and so that</b>
<br><b>seemed a reasonable explanation.&nbsp; When he went downstairs,
my aunt was</b>
<br><b>sitting on the couch in the living room, nowhere near the dining
room.&nbsp; She</b>
<br><b>swore she hadnt been upstairs, and thats true because you would
have heard</b>
<br><b>the stairs creak all the way down.&nbsp; I dont know how they do
it, I feel that</b>
<br><b>there are some really restless spirits at work there.&nbsp; They
live in</b>
<br><b>Keedysville, which is really near Antietam.&nbsp; Their land was
even fought on.</b>
<br><b>Every year around the time of Antietam they hear the battle still
going on.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Austin Hauntings</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:austingurl1970@excite.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;have about 4 incidents that I would like to share with you
and get your</b>
<br><b>opinion.&nbsp; They all occurred in different houses.</b>
<br><b>#1</b>
<br><b>This happened about 7 years ago and was probably the most frightening
for</b>
<br><b>me.&nbsp; I lived in a tri- level duplex&nbsp; with my sister in
Austin, TX.&nbsp; The</b>
<br><b>living room and study were on the top floor, kitchen and dining
room in the</b>
<br><b>middle and bedrooms and bathroom on the bottom floor.&nbsp; For
some reason, I</b>
<br><b>hated sleeping in my bdrm alone when no one was there.&nbsp; If
my sister was out</b>
<br><b>of town and my boyfriend at the time was not staying over, I was
crashed on</b>
<br><b>the couch upstairs with all the lights on and the TV.&nbsp; However,
when I did</b>
<br><b>sleep downstairs I would constantly hear footsteps as if someone
was</b>
<br><b>upstairs just pacing around.&nbsp; Upon checking, my sister and
all her pets (dog</b>
<br><b>and two cats) would be asleep in her bdrm and no one would be upstairs.&nbsp;
One</b>
<br><b>night, I was trying to go to sleep and hear someone drag their feet
across</b>
<br><b>my carpet, right by my bed and into the bathroom and roughly pull
the shower</b>
<br><b>curtain open.&nbsp; My boyfriend heard it too and freaked out and
turned on the</b>
<br><b>lights.&nbsp; He thought someone had broken in, but once again,
there was</b>
<br><b>nothing.&nbsp; I used to wait tables while attending school and
had a foot</b>
<br><b>massagger that was fashioned to look like a ladybug. Well, one night
that</b>
<br><b>thing turned on and woke me up.&nbsp; It was vibrating away on my
bookshelf and</b>
<br><b>making an awful ruckus.&nbsp; I thought nothing of it until I told
my sister</b>
<br><b>about it a few days later.&nbsp; She told me that a couple of days
ago, she had</b>
<br><b>found dozens and dozens of dead lady bugs inside and outside her
window sill</b>
<br><b>and in the corners of her bdrm.&nbsp; We had lived there for about
3 yrs and had</b>
<br><b>never had a a ladybug problem before.</b>
<br><b>#2</b>
<br><b>This happened roughly 4 years ago.</b>
<br><b>I was living in another duplex with my fiance in Austin.&nbsp; I
don't know if</b>
<br><b>this qualifies as a ghost haunting, but the whole time we lived
there I was</b>
<br><b>regulary having these weird dreams.&nbsp; I knew I was dreaming
and trying to</b>
<br><b>wake up. I could see everything in my duplex as it was and would
be escaping</b>
<br><b>someone or something breaking into the house. I would always have
the worse</b>
<br><b>time trying to wake up from these dreams.&nbsp; One time, I woke
up and THOUGHT I</b>
<br><b>saw a little girl or boy in a red jacket standing in our doorway.&nbsp;
But, I</b>
<br><b>could have been dreaming. I was in that half way&nbsp; between waking
and</b>
<br><b>sleeping stage.&nbsp; Also, one night both me an my fiance woke
up to our front</b>
<br><b>door slamming hard! It shook the whole house, but it did not appear
that we</b>
<br><b>were bugularized.</b>
<br><b>#3</b>
<br><b>This happened about 1 1/2 ago.</b>
<br><b>I was living with my fiance in Florence, KY in a apartment complex.</b>
<br><b>Supposedly, there was an Indian Burial Ground in the woods in the
back of</b>
<br><b>our apartment, but I never confirmed this with anyone.&nbsp; Nothing
significant</b>
<br><b>had happened until we had decided to move back to Austin, TX.&nbsp;
We had only</b>
<br><b>been there about 4 mos.&nbsp; The front bdrm (computer room) was
always at least</b>
<br><b>10 degrees colder than the rest of the apartment.&nbsp; One day,
I was making</b>
<br><b>breakfast and my fiance and our two dogs ran up to the store to
get orange</b>
<br><b>juice.&nbsp; I was cooking the eggs and&nbsp; someone came up behind
me an blew in my</b>
<br><b>ear!&nbsp; I thought that my fiance had snuck back and was trying
to scare me,</b>
<br><b>but he was nowhere in sight.&nbsp; Then, another night I was in
the bdrm watching</b>
<br><b>TVand I heard the living room TV shut off and our bedroom door shut.&nbsp;
T, my</b>
<br><b>fiance, was in there and I got up to see why he did that and he
was sound</b>
<br><b>asleep.&nbsp; I had to wake him up to ask him if he turned the TV
off and shut</b>
<br><b>the door.</b>
<br><b>#4</b>
<br><b>Presently</b>
<br><b>We are now living in Austin again in a 2 bdrm duplex.&nbsp; The
hallway opens up</b>
<br><b>towards the living room and there are bdrms on either side, facing
each</b>
<br><b>other.&nbsp; There is a mirror hung in the entrance of the hallway.&nbsp;
If you look</b>
<br><b>in the mirror you can see the couches in the living room.&nbsp;
Occassionally,</b>
<br><b>for split seconds it looks like a man (looks similar to my husband)
is</b>
<br><b>standing in the living room when I look in this mirror.&nbsp; My
husband is</b>
<br><b>either not at home or in another part of the house. Also, when I
am watching</b>
<br><b>TV in our bedroom, I frequently see a small shadow entering the
2nd bdrm</b>
<br><b>down the hall out of the corner of my eye.&nbsp; It is the size
of a small cat or</b>
<br><b>dog.&nbsp; Our dogs are two huge German Shepherds, so it can't be
them.</b>
<br><b>Somtimes, I see a larger one.&nbsp; My dog has barked and growled
at the wall in</b>
<br><b>the 2nd bdrm as well. It has no windows or doors.&nbsp; The weirdest
thing, and</b>
<br><b>this even freaked out my husband, who does not freak out easily,
happpened</b>
<br><b>about 3 weeks ago.&nbsp; I was in the kitchen cooking tuna helper
for dinner.&nbsp; T</b>
<br><b>was cleaning up, taking out the garbage, etc.&nbsp; When the meal
had about 5</b>
<br><b>minutes of cooking time, T went to take a shower.&nbsp; I started
looking for the</b>
<br><b>tuna helper box, because I am a diet freak and constantly looking
to see how</b>
<br><b>many calories are in this or that.&nbsp; Well, I could not find
the box and</b>
<br><b>figured T threw it away when he was cleaning the kitchen.&nbsp;
No big deal, I</b>
<br><b>stirred the pasta one more time, covered the pot,&nbsp; and set
the kitchen timer</b>
<br><b>for 5 min to let the sauce thicken.&nbsp; Then, I went back to our
bdrm to read a</b>
<br><b>couple of pages of a novel I was into.&nbsp; When the timer went
off, I went to</b>
<br><b>check on the pasta and the box was sitting right on top of the food
in the</b>
<br><b>pot!!&nbsp; T was still in the shower and when I told him about
it he freaked out</b>
<br><b>too!&nbsp; He swore that he threw the box away!&nbsp; Needless to
say, we took it as a</b>
<br><b>sign and went out for dinner that night!</b>
<br><b>Sorry these were so long, but those are my experiences.&nbsp; What
do you think?</b>
<br><b>Hauntings or my imagination?</b>

<p><b>Cemetery Ghosts</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:erfarr@hotmail.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I am a high school science teacher, and have always been fascinated
by the</b>
<br><b>occult.&nbsp; It is not as incongruous as it sounds.&nbsp; All life
is merely a form</b>
<br><b>of energy.&nbsp; Having never had a paranormal experience myself,
however, I</b>
<br><b>decided to seek one out.</b>
<br><b>Last Novemember I heard from a friend about an old, semi-abandoned
cemetery</b>
<br><b>on the outskirts of town (Athens, Georgia).&nbsp; I call the cemetery
the Old</b>
<br><b>Barnett Shoals Cemetery (OBSC), after the name of the road upon
which it is</b>
<br><b>located.&nbsp; It is unmarked, no name.&nbsp; Having read your ghost
hunting tips</b>
<br><b>(thank you), I was prepared for my first hunt.&nbsp; The night was
clear and</b>
<br><b>cool.&nbsp; It was a new moon that evening and very dark.&nbsp;
I pulled my Jeep into</b>
<br><b>the little cleared area where the few people who still attend graves
there</b>
<br><b>park.&nbsp; It was 10:30 pm.</b>
<br><b>Just a few worda about the OBSC.&nbsp; There are about thirty graves
in the</b>
<br><b>cemetery that I know of.&nbsp; Some are covered by fallen trees,
some of the</b>
<br><b>markers are illegible from rust (they are the old tin markers -
very cheap).</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; The stones that are still standing lean at angles from the
ground, due to</b>
<br><b>pressure from tree roots.&nbsp; A few graves are well kept still,
but the rest</b>
<br><b>are abandoned.&nbsp; The graves date back to the 1870's.&nbsp; The
one that I noticed</b>
<br><b>immediately was the grave of a 15 year old girl, named Minnie Center.&nbsp;
Ther</b>
<br><b>are many graves of children in the old cemetery.</b>
<br><b>As I pulled up to park, my radio went to static.&nbsp; The station
was a strong</b>
<br><b>local station, and there were no power lines or telephone wires
above me.</b>
<br><b>Changing the channel, I got the same thing - static.&nbsp; This
seemed like a</b>
<br><b>good omen to me.&nbsp; Getting out, I said a quick prayer and walked
into the</b>
<br><b>graveyard.&nbsp; All was still and silent.&nbsp; Turning off my
flashlight, I tried to</b>
<br><b>get accostomed to the dark, but I had to turn it back on to see
where to go.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; It was too dark, and the ground too overgrown.&nbsp; I walked
around, talking</b>
<br><b>to whoever was listening, getting used to where I was.&nbsp; Asking
permission</b>
<br><b>first, I began taking pictures.&nbsp; After my roll of film was
almost gone, I</b>
<br><b>began to head back to the Jeep.&nbsp; As I walked around, I noticed
many cold</b>
<br><b>spots which were confirmed by my thermometer.&nbsp; It once dipped
from 55F to</b>
<br><b>45F in the span of a few seconds.&nbsp; Not a drastic change, but
on a still</b>
<br><b>night like this one a ten degree drop is peculiar.&nbsp; As I neared
the Jeep (I</b>
<br><b>had been out there over an hour and needed to get home), I felt
the hairs on</b>
<br><b>the back of my neck rise.&nbsp; Turning around, I took two pictures
in a row of</b>
<br><b>the same area - a panoramic view of the cemetery.&nbsp; Saying thank
you and</b>
<br><b>finishing another prayer, I got in the Jeep and went home.&nbsp;
I was surprised</b>
<br><b>to find that my adventure had paid off when I got my pictures back.</b>
<br><b>Two months later, I went back to the OBSC in the daytime.&nbsp;
I took quite a</b>
<br><b>few pictures and was again pleasantly surprised.&nbsp; Now having
two outings in</b>
<br><b>the same place, and getting anomalies on film each time (using a
different</b>
<br><b>camera each trip), I then contacted the GHHT&nbsp; (GA Haunt Hunt
Team) to see if</b>
<br><b>they wanted to get together, see my picures, etc.&nbsp; They never
got back to</b>
<br><b>me.&nbsp; So, I figured I'd share it with the people who gave me
the information</b>
<br><b>I needed to get the hunt underway:&nbsp; the Shadowlands.&nbsp;
And yes, Dave, I went</b>
<br><b>alone (sorry).</b>
<br><b>If you would like to see the pictures of my OBSC hunt, please go

<br><b>Childhood Experience</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: rtenney1@home.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>When I was eight years old my grandfather passed away and we had
a three</b>
<br><b>hour trip to Buckhannon, West Virginia where he wanted to be buried.
We</b>
<br><b>stayed with my grandfathers brother and his wife Aunt Bonnie in
an old</b>
<br><b>castle-like house which still stands today. The only night we were
to</b>
<br><b>stay in the house was stormy and violent. This was strange due to
the 70</b>
<br><b>degree sunny weather we experienced throughout the entire trip except</b>
<br><b>for that one single night in that house.</b>
<br><b>I remember going to bed with my brother who is two years older than
me</b>
<br><b>in one of the second floor back bedrooms. The storm had awoken both
of</b>
<br><b>us and to ease our nerves we began whispering to each other. We
were</b>
<br><b>afraid that we woke the others with our whispering when we heard
someone</b>
<br><b>walking around on the ground floor. The dining room on the ground
floor</b>
<br><b>was met with a door which led to the stair case to the second floor.
I</b>
<br><b>remember that the door was always closed and was an annoyance when
going</b>
<br><b>up and down the stairs. At the top of the stairs there was a long</b>
<br><b>hallway which led to some bedrooms where we were. Now, we REALLY
thought</b>
<br><b>we had woken someone when we heard footsteps walking across the
hardwood</b>
<br><b>floors downstairs. They were loud and easy to hear through the storm.
We</b>
<br><b>both heard the door to the staircase open and close. Every footstep</b>
<br><b>coming up the flight of stairs was heard by my brother and I. At
the top</b>
<br><b>of the stairs we heard the walking continue down the hallway where
our</b>
<br><b>family had been tucked in. When the footsteps reached somewhere
outside</b>
<br><b>the bedroom doors it stopped. My brother reached for my hand and
was</b>
<br><b>squeezing it tightly and he was looking at me with a terrified look
in</b>
<br><b>his eyes. I think somewhere around four to five whole minutes passed</b>
<br><b>when we heard another set of footsteps coming towards our room.
These</b>
<br><b>steps were much softer and light. Our bedroom door was only cracked
a</b>
<br><b>little and began to open when my Aunt peered into the room. We were</b>
<br><b>relieved that it was only her. I asked if she was the one walking
around</b>
<br><b>downstairs earlier. Her response was, "try to go back to sleep,</b>
<br><b>everything's ok". With that my brother and I toughed out the rest
of the</b>
<br><b>storm and fell back asleep.</b>
<br><b>The following morning we both were asking my Aunt Bonnie what she
was</b>
<br><b>doing downstairs walking around in the middle of the night. She
told us</b>
<br><b>that she wasn't and that everyone was sleeping. She told us there
are</b>
<br><b>always sounds like that in that house. She said she was woken by
the</b>
<br><b>sound of someone opening and closing the door to the staircase.
She got</b>
<br><b>worried that it might have been one of us kids and thought she'd
better</b>
<br><b>check on us. She got up and checked on us and told us to go back
to</b>
<br><b>sleep. She then went downstairs to check on things and found the</b>
<br><b>basement door was cracked open slightly. We didn't think anything
of</b>
<br><b>this but was told by her that the basement door was, to her knowledge,</b>
<br><b>tightly closed at bedtime. She told us other stories of someone
walking</b>
<br><b>around the house at all hours of the day and night but never to
be seen,</b>
<br><b>only heard. Doors would open and close on their own, window curtains
in</b>
<br><b>rooms where the windows had been drawn would minutes later be found</b>
<br><b>pulled open when no one else was in the house but her. She said
that</b>
<br><b>maybe the ghost was just checking us out and wanted to have a quick</b>
<br><b>peek. This is an experience that I will never forget.</b>

<p><b>Childhood Frights</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: J1970K@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I am a32-year-old man, and have lived in this house for most of</b>
<br><b>my life now. It originally belonged to my parents, but after my
mother's</b>
<br><b>final remission with cancer was over and she was dying, she gave
the house to</b>
<br><b>my wife and I.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I have not witnessed any activity in a number of years now that I</b>
<br><b>am aware of, but things were different when I was a small child
on through my</b>
<br><b>teenage years. My first experience was an out of body but bodily
functional</b>
<br><b>one. It was the first time I had been in the house, (I was 4 at
the time),</b>
<br><b>and as I was walking through the basement, it was as if something
just</b>
<br><b>grabbed my spirit and pulled me up against the ceiling. I just looked
down at</b>
<br><b>myself walking with a bag of clothespins to the other side of the
room where</b>
<br><b>the washer was placed then watched as my body came back. As soon
I was under</b>
<br><b>myself (soul that really sounds weird, but I have no other way
of</b>
<br><b>explaining it). whatever was holding me let go and the next thing
I knew I</b>
<br><b>was standing there with the feeling in my stomach like I had fallen
out of a</b>
<br><b>tree.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It was probably only a few months later when I had another visit.</b>
<br><b>This time I was awoke very late at night by an apparition standing
at the</b>
<br><b>foot of my older brother's bed, which was across the room from my
bed and the</b>
<br><b>attic door was right there. I tried to move and then call my brother
but</b>
<br><b>could do neither. I just laid there frozen and staring at the figure,
it</b>
<br><b>seemed to be a gray-white color and almost looked like a girl a
little older</b>
<br><b>than my brother who was almost 9 at the time.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The very next night I awoke to the same scenario, but this time I</b>
<br><b>managed to squeak out my brother's name. When he woke, he saw me
staring</b>
<br><b>straight at the door, he then looked over and was frozen in place
also. It</b>
<br><b>wasn't 15 seconds later that a second apparition appeared through
the door.</b>
<br><b>This one being of an adult, male or female I could not tell you.
It looked</b>
<br><b>first at me, then my brother, then at the small apparition. It just
seemed to</b>
<br><b>be looking at the small one for a long while like they were talking
or</b>
<br><b>communicating in someway. Then they both looked at me then my brother,
then</b>
<br><b>they turned around and both disappeared behind the door. That was
the last</b>
<br><b>time I had "saw" them.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Life goes on and all is well, well almost. About 2 years later,</b>
<br><b>(age 6 now) I was awakened by a malicious evil presence. Frightened
but</b>
<br><b>mobile I got out of bed and headed for the safety of Mom and Dad's
bed. As I</b>
<br><b>started walking, I could feel the presence getting closer from behind.
By the</b>
<br><b>time I had gotten to my parent's bed, it (whatever it was) was
right</b>
<br><b>behind me and I could feel an icy grip on my shoulder that paralyzed
my body,</b>
<br><b>speech, and breathing. It started pulling me under the bed on my
father's</b>
<br><b>side, and just as my head was about to be pulled under my father
awoke,</b>
<br><b>bolted up in bed, and turned the light on. He reached down and pulled
me out</b>
<br><b>from under the bed. He saw how scared I was. (I don't know weather
he had</b>
<br><b>felt the presence too, or if he had felt the fear emanating from
me. But from</b>
<br><b>that night on he and I had shared a special link mentally and psychically</b>
<br><b>until his suicide which I had mental and physical {to say I felt
what had</b>
<br><b>happened} knowledge at the moment it happened)</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It all went away for a few more years. I was 13 and home alone in</b>
<br><b>my room, my brother had moved into the attic for his privacy and
had put a</b>
<br><b>lock on the door. I was sitting on my bed listening to the radio
and heard a</b>
<br><b>strange voice and it seemed to be coming from up there. I turned
off the</b>
<br><b>radio to listen and it stopped. As I turned the radio back on I
could hear</b>
<br><b>the laughter of a little girl. (same little girl???) I turned the
radio off</b>
<br><b>again and listened but there was only silence. I continued to listen,
and in</b>
<br><b>about a minute or so I heard the baseball my brother kept on his
desk roll</b>
<br><b>off the edge, hit the floor and roll to the other side of the room,
stop,</b>
<br><b>roll back across the floor, bounce 3 times then get dropped back
on his desk.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Then finally, the last time was about a year or so before my</b>
<br><b>fathers death, I had another visit from the evil one. It seemed
to have been</b>
<br><b>staying away from me, but I think it had been tormenting my father
for a few</b>
<br><b>years. He had taken up drinking hard and cursing at my mother then
finally</b>
<br><b>beating her up. I was 15 at the time and remember all hell breaking
loose. My</b>
<br><b>father was down in the kitchen, my mother was hiding from him somewhere,
and</b>
<br><b>my brother and I were in the upstairs bathroom talking while I was
combing my</b>
<br><b>hair after a bath. I heard my fathers creaming, God Damned You,
Get the F***</b>
<br><b>out of my house you no good rotten bastard. At first I thought
he found my</b>
<br><b>mother, but the next thing I knew I could feel that cold icy presence
and</b>
<br><b>both my brother and I saw the reflection of a shadow pass the open
bathroom</b>
<br><b>door. We both ran out of the bathroom to see what it was, but there
was</b>
<br><b>nothing there. I know it was not my mother; she went over to the
neighbor's</b>
<br><b>house to hide from my father.</b>
<br><b>To my knowledge, the two incidents that happened with my brother
present are</b>
<br><b>the only times in which he had seen anything of this nature. If
he had seen</b>
<br><b>others, he has never shared them with me. I hope I don't jinx myself
by</b>
<br><b>saying this, but it has been 17 years since that night, and I have
not seen</b>
<br><b>anything else. (Maybe because of my father and mother being on the
other side</b>
<br><b>of life now and they are protecting me? I don't know.) But I think
my 10 and</b>
<br><b>12-year-old boys may have seen, heard, or felt something, but they
seem to</b>
<br><b>not want to talk about it. but yet, they are extremely interested
in haunted</b>
<br><b>houses and ghosts! Outside of my brother and a very few friends,
I have not</b>
<br><b>shared my encounters with anyone, mostly for avoiding the criticism
that</b>
<br><b>comes from those who have never lived life with the lifeless.</b>

<p><b>Comforting Experience</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: jdowding@towerrecords.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have an experience that I would like to share. Please do not post
my name</b>
<br><b>or email address. A few weeks ago, I had to drive down to Los Angeles
(from</b>
<br><b>Sacramento) on a trip I really didn't want to take! My Aunt and
her two boys</b>
<br><b>lived with my grandparents. In 1991, her oldest son, who was 14
at the time</b>
<br><b>was killed while on a camping trip with some friends. A death in
the family</b>
<br><b>is never easy but this horrible event was a blow that none of us
have ever</b>
<br><b>really recovered from. This particular cousin was someone I was
very close</b>
<br><b>too and still think of as a brother. My grandfather passed away
about three</b>
<br><b>years ago, my grandmother passed about a year later. My Aunt put
all of</b>
<br><b>their things in storage and she and her only living son moved to
another</b>
<br><b>state (they only took what would fit in her car - which wasn't very
much!).</b>
<br><b>Because my Aunt could no longer afford the payments, I had to clear
out the</b>
<br><b>storage area that contained the furniture and personal affects of
my</b>
<br><b>grandparents and cousin. I rented a moving van and packed up what
I could,</b>
<br><b>and brought it back to my apartment in Sacramento. Being surrounded
by their</b>
<br><b>stuff (and this being The Shadowlands) you can probably see where
all this</b>
<br><b>is leading. I am convinced that they are with me and looking out
for me and</b>
<br><b>my kids (aged 6 and 5). Here is why: One night, a day or two after
the trip,</b>
<br><b>I decided it was bedtime and went to my room. I had only been laying
down</b>
<br><b>for a few minutes when I heard a voice say, "Get up." I was a soft,
male</b>
<br><b>voice and not at all stern or angry sounding. Being rather tired,
it didn't</b>
<br><b>occur to me right away that I was alone in the apartment (except
for the</b>
<br><b>kids) and I actually started to reply, "But it's not time yet."
Then, in a</b>
<br><b>flash, I realized that I had left a candle burning! I jumped up
right away</b>
<br><b>and put the candle out. A couple of evenings later, I was getting
ready to</b>
<br><b>put my kids in bed and doing some last minute straightening while
they</b>
<br><b>finished watching a cartoon. I walked by my kids' room and saw that
the</b>
<br><b>light was on. They have a 6' floor lamp, rather than a ceiling light.
Being</b>
<br><b>in the middle of a power crisis(!), and despite the fact that it
was almost</b>
<br><b>time for them to brush their teeth; I hit the switch to turn the
light off.</b>
<br><b>The light stayed on. I flipped the switch a couple of times but
the light</b>
<br><b>still would not turn off. I walked into their room to see what the
hell was</b>
<br><b>going on and found that my daughter had thrown one of her Beanie
Babies on</b>
<br><b>top of the lamp. (I know it was her because she admitted to doing
this). I</b>
<br><b>have no idea how long the thing had been laying on the light bulb
but, when</b>
<br><b>I took it down, it had a hole burnt into the side of it and it was
smoking!</b>
<br><b>I started shaking pretty badly and my stomach was doing flip-flops;
not</b>
<br><b>because of the freakiness with the lamp, but because we were about
a minute</b>
<br><b>away from a full blown fire in the apartment (I always suspected
that Beanie</b>
<br><b>Babies were evil). ;-) The Beanie Baby was so hot from being on
the bulb</b>
<br><b>that I had to soak it in water before I could throw it away, or
risk</b>
<br><b>starting a fire in the trash can. I cannot emphasize enough how
close we</b>
<br><b>came to having our home burnt to the ground! After each of these
incidents,</b>
<br><b>I said thank you to my cousin and grandparents for keeping us safe.
I am</b>
<br><b>sharing this because I want to honor them, and thank them again,
and to let</b>
<br><b>people know that our loved ones are never far from us.</b>

<p><b>Crescent Hotel</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Tonan044@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>After much thought I have decided to tell my story about a night
in the</b>
<br><b>Crescent. My wife and I were married the day before in Eureka Springs
and Had</b>
<br><b>plans to stay at the Crescent in room 218 {which I reserved 3 months
earlier}</b>
<br><b>We arrived late in the day after a long day of canoeing. My new
bride was</b>
<br><b>exhausted and quickly went to sleep not worried about the so called
"Ghost."</b>
<br><b>So as I was waiting for a Kansas City Chiefs preseason game to begin
I was</b>
<br><b>left to find the ghost myself. I tried everything that you weren't
supposed</b>
<br><b>to do like changing the furniture around and slightly moving a picture
on the</b>
<br><b>wall and even asking the ghost to appear to no avail. Finally I
gave up and</b>
<br><b>decided to wait for the game to start and forget about all the nonsense.
Then</b>
<br><b>I heard voices outside of the door and as I looked out the peep
hole I saw</b>
<br><b>that there were people who would stop in front of the door and talk
about the</b>
<br><b>famous room 218. That's when I decided I would have a little fun.
Still</b>
<br><b>looking through the peep hole everytime someone would come close
to the door</b>
<br><b>I would turn the knob a little or tap on the door with my new wedding
ring.</b>
<br><b>This was great I was having a fun time scaring people. Then as I
was waiting</b>
<br><b>for more victims I was tapping my ring on the door then paused to
see how</b>
<br><b>long till the Chiefs game began but when I stopped tapping the tapping
was</b>
<br><b>still there. Thinking I was now the joke of someone on the outside
I opened</b>
<br><b>the door quickly but no one was around. I then decided I had came
in touch</b>
<br><b>with the ghost and he was also a jokester also. For the rest of
the night I</b>
<br><b>behaved myself</b><b></b>

<p><b>I have a few experiences with entities over the years, and am currently
being bothrered by one who I cant seem to shake off.</b>
<br><b>My problem is that I suspect I am a "ghost magnet" and find myself
subjected to approaches from spirit, although I appear to lack any mediumistic
abilities to allow me to communicate effectiveley and help these guys out
( oddly it is often remarked on by everyone I know that I have the same
problem with the living in that people always seem to want to tell me things
that perhaps they wouldnt tell anyone else, to the point where complete
strangers have revealed all sorts of intimacies, my wife hates walking
in town with me as people just walk up and speak to me....I dont know if
the two are linked but I suspect that our behaviour when we are dead is
simular to that we are used to when "here", therefore it follows that if
people want to talk with me now they may still want to do that after death.)
Obviously the living are easy to speak with.. (who says?).. as I too am
alive but the dead?... well so far all my attempts have failed.</b>
<br><b>Examples of what I have experienced are:</b>
<br><b>Voices calling my name into my ear when I am slumbering, exremely
off putting and injurous to ones sleeping patterns,appiritions appearing
and disappearing in front of me and others with me, to date I have seen
6 of these figures, 5 were apparently unaware I was watching, in that no
interaction occoured, whilst the 6th sent me running in fear as it seemed
to be "stalking me" whilst giving off the most appalling sense of menace
I have ever felt, again I wouldnt say I am happy that these things have
occoured, and I don`t much care whether I am believed or not, they simply
are.</b>
<br><b>I now appear to have to share my family home with one of these "shades"
who variously throws things at my wife, blows just about every bulb we
put in in about five seconds, hides important items(keys wallets etc) which
causes all sorts of rumpus, and more recently appears to be waging some
sort of war against my domestic appliances having in one week killed my
dishwasher, cooker and washing machine, of course a skeptic like me would
normally class these events as "bad luck" or simular, however anyone who
spent enough time here would very soon realise that these events occour
within these walls with such regularity as to to indicate otherwise, also
we catch regular fleeting glimpses of a female figure (usaully in the corner
of our eye) and experience all the classic cold spots loud enexplained
nocturnal crashes and thuds, (commented on by neighbours}.</b>
<br><b>Now ordinarily someone would attempt to either remove the spirit
or remove oneself, but I am not a quitter, the only action against it I
have taken is tthreaten to administer a good kicking to her when I myself
slip off this mortal coil, which oddly saw a definite improvement in relations
with a reduction in costly repairs and replacement of broken appliances,
I know she is still here and I badly want to help her on her way but as
I mentioned earlier I do not have the wherewithall to do so.</b>
<br><b>I only write this to pass on the following:</b>
<br><b>when we die we do not neccessarily become angels, we appear to remain
being petty and petulant if we were in life,</b>
<br><b>It would appear that for what ever reason some poor souls seem to
be unable to move on, and remain here frustrated and impotent attempting
to contact people like me who cant hear them properly ( I personally find
this idea extremley disturbing)</b>
<br><b>I would also speculate that discarnate entities such as those I
report are either unable or unwilling to admit they are dead and still
think they will become physical again if they hang around long enough.</b>
<br><b>anyway there it is, sorry not much detail but really I would never
stop once I started telling.</b>

my head!</b>
<br><b>Funny, I hadn't thought of these creatures in such a long time --

<br><b>Death Standing Over My Bed</b><b></b>
<p><b>By Sabahina</b><b></b>
<p><b>This is a story that I shall never forget. I was about 17 years old,
my</b>
<br><b>first child was 3 months old. I lived in a really nice apartment
in Laurel,</b>
<br><b>Maryland. You know, fireplace, bedrooms on different sides of the
apartment,</b>
<br><b>THIRD FLOOR LEVEL.</b>
<br><b>One night, I was sleeping, so was my beautiful baby boy. Suddenly,
I awoke</b>
<br><b>for no reason at all. I was sleeping on my side on the left hand
side of the</b>
<br><b>bed. My son was in his bassinet on the right hand side of the bed.
When I</b>
<br><b>opened my eyes, standing above me was what I felt to be a man. He
resembled</b>
<br><b>the Grim Reaper in every way. Dark, dark clothing, a hood and, worst
of all,</b>
<br><b>no face. I tried with all of my might to scream, but my vocal chords
were</b>
<br><b>frozen with fear. So, I just pulled the covers up over my head and
prayed</b>
<br><b>that this creature disappear. A short time later, I looked from
under the</b>
<br><b>covers and there was no one there.</b>
<br><b>I ran into my fathers room all the way on the other side of the
apartment,</b>
<br><b>yet he was sound asleep, snoring and all. I checked the balcony
door,</b>
<br><b>LOCKED, I checked all of the windows (except my dad's room), LOCKED.
We</b>
<br><b>lived on the third floor and there was no sign of a break in. Though
this</b>
<br><b>evil, evil person had been standing over my bed as though it was
my turn.</b>
<br><b>I have read your articles about sleep paralysis, this can not be
considering</b>
<br><b>I was completely able to move around. This happened in October of
1993, and</b>
<br><b>there is someone who has experienced the same and posted her and
her</b>
<br><b>fianc&eacute;'s experiences here at Shadowlands. It happened to
her twenty years</b>
<br><b>ago, yet around the same time of the year, though in a completely
different</b>
<br><b>state.</b>
<br><b>Does the Grim Reaper go around harassing people even though it is
not their</b>
<br><b>time to go???</b>

<p><b>Enough With The Hauntings Already</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: crazycanuck1980@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I've written before but my story was not published but more interesting
things have happened to me since that I had to write again.&nbsp; I come
from a very superstitiuos family that takes everything seriously.&nbsp;
Since I was a child weird unexplained things have occurred but the most
recent are freaking me out.&nbsp; I guess it started when we moved to our
current house,&nbsp; I would wake up and there at the foot of my bed was
what looked like a lady in a victorian style dress looking at me at times
it looks like she was pacing she was very dark and I guess it could be
a shadow but the way it was configured ? I don't know .All I know is&nbsp;
I would be scared outta my tree so I would bring my blanket over my head
and force my self to sleep that way.&nbsp; But this is pretty tame, soon
afterwards right after lying down I had heard a child laugh.&nbsp; I was
about 13 years old and I just put it off as my neighbours having a party
so I decided to get up and close all the windows (It was summer)&nbsp;
funny thing is that all the windows that I went to close were already closed.&nbsp;
I was freaked right out so I ran right to bed and tried to forget about
it.&nbsp; About a year afterwards I woke up to the feeling of being watched,
when my eyes adjusted I noticed on the side of my bed it looked to be a
figure of an older man and child and they just stood there looking at me
I know what you are thinking...shadows right, no these figures were facing
the window there was no backdrop for shadows, I flipped out I quickly jumped
outta bed to flick the light switch when I turned around it looked like
a haze slowly disappearing needless to say I didn't sleep in my room for
a while.&nbsp; This happened to my mom She just settled into bed when she
woke up and there was what she claimed a white light came from the hall
towards her she screamed and woke up the whole house.&nbsp; We rushed in
flicked on the lights her eyes were wide open (she didn't even react to
the light) and she was pale to the point her skin was blue.&nbsp; also
I awoke in my new room located in the basement now and their was a dark
figure in the corner I prayed to God and when I opened my eyes it looked
like it was moving across my room. And I could feel its presence but it
didn't;t seem like it was going to harm me I keep feeling like it's family.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Lastly the most recent was in our computer room (formerly my old bedroom)
shortly after my 21st bidthday I was up one night everyone was asleep all
the lights were on when I felt that there was a presence in the room and
I would occasionally look in that direction but nothingwas there until
I started to type and felt my hair on my head being touched and then I
heard my name being whispered softly.&nbsp; I finished my homework the
next day in bright daylight just to make sure.Anyhow your probably bored
out of your tree if you like please email me if you have the same stuff
happening or if you want to hear more stories</b><b></b>

none of us really</b>
<br><b>liked to sleep in, although none of us ever mentioned that fact

<br><b>floor with a blanket and pillow....during the night, I had fallen
asleep..and I felt</b>
<br><b>like something was hitting me with one of the dining room chairs-
I could feel the pressure of</b>
<br><b>the blows, but no pain. I woke up, and couldnt move because something
was about 6 inches</b>
<br><b>above me, something black. I started to scream, and squirmed down
to the end of the</b>
<br><b>bed and ran out the front door. My friend tony ran out after me,
and told me that he heard</b>
<br><b>me screaming, but he couldnt get to me because there was something
black blocking him and</b>
<br><b>he couldnt see me. Our other roomie Karen was asleep in the 'uncomfortable'
room with</b>
<br><b>her boyfriend none of us would sleep in there if we were alone>
- she had heard me</b>
<br><b>screaming, and tried to come into the living room, but couldnt get
the door open for some</b>
<br><b>reason. whatever was in there seemed to choose me to pick on, im
not sure why. at one point,</b>
<br><b>karen and I went out to dinner one night. tony was already at work,
and i had the only</b>
<br><b>other housekey. we left the hoodlight of the stove on for when we
came home, went to</b>
<br><b>dinner, and as we were on our way home, i told karen that i was
feeling apprehensive and</b>
<br><b>scared to go home, and didnt know why. she told me that she was
feeling the same way. when we</b>
<br><b>got home, we walked up to the front door- we had 2 big windows with
filmy curtains in</b>
<br><b>the front, and a big light that shone down into our apartment behind
us. I noticed that the</b>
<br><b>stove light wasnt on, and I commented on that to karen. by that
time, we were getting scared,</b>
<br><b>because we knew no one had been there while we were gone. our front
door was right</b>
<br><b>next to our neighbors door, and as we passed by his window, i saw
him sitting in front</b>
<br><b>of the television not 2 feet from his front window. so i unlocked
the door, and swung it</b>
<br><b>open. we both stood in the doorway, and the light above the stove
was off..but the light behind</b>
<br><b>us shined inside, and we could see things. I had a big oval mirror
hanging by the hallway,</b>
<br><b>and the light always bounced on it when the door was open. I noticed
that i couldnt see</b>
<br><b>the mirror, and as I stood there, my eyes focused on a huge black
thing standing in front</b>
<br><b>of the mirror. It, whatever it was, had to stand at least 8 feet
tall, as it almost reached</b>
<br><b>the ceiling. It had the shape of a man, but no features, just all
black. we both screamed and ran</b>
<br><b>to the neighbor's window, and banged on it. He was still sitting
watching tv, but he didnt</b>
<br><b>even hear us, just kept watching tv. we ran out to the&nbsp; car,
and i kept asking her what she</b>
<br><b>saw, and when she told me, i realized that we had both seen the
same thing. I realized that i</b>
<br><b>had left my keys in the door, and agonized over getting them...but
my carkeys were on the</b>
<br><b>keychain, so i had no choice. I finally went back, didnt look, grabbed
the keys and ran</b>
<br><b>without even shutting the door. later on when we went home &lt;with
tony> i checked the</b>
<br><b>stove light, and it had been shut off. a week or so later, we found
some halloween stuff that</b>
<br><b>the previous tenant had left in the top of one closet, and once
we got rid of that, we</b>
<br><b>had no more problems. we had heard that the people who lived there
before had been into</b>
<br><b>some sort of dark things, but didnt know for sure.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Experiences</b><b></b>

<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I had quite a scare in 1976, while stationed on the island of Attu
Alaska, I</b>
<br><b>wittnesed a WWII soldier</b>
<br><b>in full combat dress.</b>
<br><b>He was just staring at me, and then he faded away.</b>
<br><b>When I went to the base Dr., he said that I was one of many uys
who told him</b>
<br><b>the same story.</b>
<br><b>he also told me the history of the Island during WWII,</b>
<br><b>how many soldiers died in such a short time,</b>
<br><b>how massacre valley got its name, etc...</b>
<br><b>Since that day, I have beleived in the existence of</b>
<br><b>ghosts.</b>
<br><b>I have never shared this story t anyone outside my family, but I
wanted to</b>
<br><b>share it with you.</b>
<br><b>I apperciate what you are doing.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Experiences of Ghosts</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: howell@breakaways.fsnet.co.uk</b><b></b>
<p><b>My name is Andrea Im 19 years old and I have a very strong interest
in ghost research. Right from a young age, I have been seeing ghosts talking
2 them hearing them and now I realise I would like 2 make a career out
of it. I recently went on holiday to Spain for a week and stayed in a villa,
the room I slept in was definitly active with afterlife. I sensed as soon
as I walked in 2 the room it had a cold negative feeling. The atmosphere
in the room was such a awful feeling, I told my family and they just laughed
at me! I am partially physic also told by a physic.</b>
<br><b>In a way I feel lucky that I can communicate with the dead. I have
seen my deseased family before now and spoken 2 them. Where I live in the
UK was a very old deralic house dating back 2 the first wold war. I often
walk past this house and feel a sense of evil, so me being me went inside
the house to investigate and saw a young beautiful woman dressed in rags
sobbing. I began 2 speak 2 her but she vanished, seeing this and feeling
a evil presense made me leave the building.</b>
<br><b>Now 9 months down the line the house has been knocked down due 2
health and safety risks as there had been fires.</b>
<br><b>I later found out that under the celler in the house where I felt
this evil, were three remains of bodies. Apparently 2 cases of their deaths
were suicidal and the other case was where this person at the time had
drowned in the stream nearby the house.</b>
<br><b>I can also hear ghosts in my head now this is not a sign of madness
but I feel sensitive 2 ghosts and emotions around me.</b>
<br><b>Thank you all for reading my experiences happy ghost hunting,</b>

<p><b>Family Visitations</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: JTabares@specialinc.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am the only member of my family who has
never seen a ghost.&nbsp; You're</b>
<br><b>probably asking what I am doing on this page then.&nbsp; Well, even
though I have</b>
<br><b>never had such an experience, I find the subject very fascinating.&nbsp;
My</b>
<br><b>brother, father and uncle have all seen ghosts.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, a bit of background.&nbsp; I was
born in 1964, my brother in 1966,</b>
<br><b>our parents had us rather late in life, ( my father was born in
1923, my</b>
<br><b>mother in 1925 ) and we are first generation Mexican-American.&nbsp;
When my</b>
<br><b>father first came over to the United States, he went from farm to
farm</b>
<br><b>looking for work.&nbsp; One night, he stopped at an old abandoned
ranch house to</b>
<br><b>avoid a downpour.&nbsp; This was in the early 1940s and he faced
quite a bit of</b>
<br><b>prejudice so he always carried a weapon and was careful about where
he</b>
<br><b>slept.&nbsp; Instead of going into the bedroom, he found a smaller
store room in</b>
<br><b>the house and slept there.&nbsp; In the middle of the night, something
woke him</b>
<br><b>up.&nbsp; He said that he felt he was not alone in the house.&nbsp;
Thinking he might</b>
<br><b>be in danger from drifters, he drew his knife and went to investigate.&nbsp;
He</b>
<br><b>saw a light in the kitchen and remembering there was no electricity,
thought</b>
<br><b>the house might be burning.&nbsp; He walked in and saw a man, sitting
on the</b>
<br><b>floor, with his legs our in front of him in a "V."&nbsp; The light
seemed to be</b>
<br><b>on him, but was not coming from anywhere.&nbsp; The thing that scared
my father</b>
<br><b>the most was when he looked up at his face, the man seemed to have
an</b>
<br><b>impossibly wide grin, literally ear-to-ear.&nbsp; He then saw that
the man was</b>
<br><b>wearing a sort of cloth, or cotton fabric across the bottom of his
face, in</b>
<br><b>the bad light, it looked like a big white grin.&nbsp; He seemed
to remember his</b>
<br><b>father telling him that sometimes, dead people had such cloths put
across</b>
<br><b>their faces, and this one's seemed to have slipped down.&nbsp; He
knew then that</b>
<br><b>this was not natural, the man was not breathing or moving.&nbsp;
My father backed</b>
<br><b>out of the kitchen, and ran out of the house.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Years later, now a homeowner in a small
Texas town, he told us this</b>
<br><b>story, and one about our uncle.&nbsp; My uncle drove trucks in Mexico,
and often</b>
<br><b>had to drive all night.&nbsp; His area of Mexico is a very mountainous
place and</b>
<br><b>on one particularly dangerous road, he drove very slowly.&nbsp;
He had driven</b>
<br><b>that road in the daylight and knew that down the side of the small
cliff,</b>
<br><b>there were many overturned trucks that did not make the curve, and
were left</b>
<br><b>there to rot.&nbsp; One night, as he was nearing the curve, he heard
something, a</b>
<br><b>bumping noise on his driver side window.&nbsp; He turned and saw
a man, dark and</b>
<br><b>shadowy, clinging to his truck, his dark face just a few inches
from his,</b>
<br><b>separated only by glass.&nbsp; My uncle almost lost control of the
truck and</b>
<br><b>afraid for his sanity, never looked at the man again.&nbsp; In his
peripheral</b>
<br><b>vision, however, the man was still there, never moving, just holding
on.&nbsp; As</b>
<br><b>my uncle neared the curve that had killed many a man, the apparition
simply</b>
<br><b>jumped off.&nbsp; My uncle requested a change of routes the very
next morning.</b>
<br><b>His boss, did not argue, as my uncle was simply one of many drivers
who,</b>
<br><b>after having been scared on that route, requested changes too.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My brother's ghost story happed just a
few years back.&nbsp; He was driving</b>
<br><b>home from visiting a girlfriend.&nbsp; She lived on the outskirts
of town and he</b>
<br><b>had to drive past some old abandoned warehouses and grain storage
bins to</b>
<br><b>get home.&nbsp; It was dark and he had his headlights on.&nbsp;
He was just driving</b>
<br><b>along, when suddenly, a woman wearing white just walked out in front
of his</b>
<br><b>car.&nbsp; He hit the brakes and was about to lean on the horn,
when she turned</b>
<br><b>to look at him.&nbsp; She had no eyes.&nbsp; My brother closed his
eyes hard for a</b>
<br><b>second, to clear them.&nbsp; He thought it was a trick of the light.&nbsp;
When he</b>
<br><b>opened them a second later, the lady was gone.&nbsp; He turned to
the direction</b>
<br><b>she had been walking in before he closed his eyes and saw that she
was</b>
<br><b>already 100 yards or so away, walking through an overgrown lot between
some</b>
<br><b>warehouses.&nbsp; There was no way she could have run that far so
quickly.&nbsp; She</b>
<br><b>disappeared behind some building and my brother drove home.&nbsp;
By the time he</b>
<br><b>got to the back door, he was shaking so bad he could not hold the
keys and</b>
<br><b>had to knock to be let in.</b>
<br><b>He still drives that road, but never at night.</b>
