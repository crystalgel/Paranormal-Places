<b>The Sleeping Hag</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:Tegu2001@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hello, my name is Guy and I am only 14 years old but I know a good
deal</b>
<br><b>about ghosts and I have even encountered many, some of them even
scary</b>
<br><b>experiences. I am not sure where to begin because I have had tons
of experiences with</b>
<br><b>ghosts and as did my family. I'll begin with my father, who had
the first</b>
<br><b>ghostly experience in the house located in New Jersey, where we
still</b>
<br><b>live. It was about 15 years ago, and he was sleeping in a room on
the second</b>
<br><b>floor of our two story home. It was around 6:00 AM when he felt
something crawl</b>
<br><b>into his bed, he thought it was his dog, but, to his shock it wasn't.
His</b>
<br><b>dog was nowhere to be found and suddenly he couldn't move. It felt
like</b>
<br><b>something was holding him down. After a few minutes the thing disappeared.
The next</b>
<br><b>morning, around the same time, my father was awakened by the same
feeling</b>
<br><b>of something crawling into his bed. Again, he couldn't move and
it felt like</b>
<br><b>something was holding him down. He somehow found it in him to raise
his</b>
<br><b>arms and feel around and was shocked when he felt what was like
the old,</b>
<br><b>clammy, arms of an elderly woman, he believes it was the ghost of
an old woman. I</b>
<br><b>later read stories about something called a "Sleeping Hag" which
visits</b>
<br><b>people and paralyzes them so to speak in their sleep. When I was
born a</b>
<br><b>year or so later my father put me in that room and he moved into
another room</b>
<br><b>on the second floor, 3 years later my sister was born and we were
both put in</b>
<br><b>the room and shared it. When I was around 5 years old, my sister
was fast</b>
<br><b>asleep across from me in the room and I was staring at the ceiling,
when,</b>
<br><b>out of the corner of my eye I saw something walking into the room,
stop and</b>
<br><b>stare at me, and then continue walking until it disappeared. It
looked like a</b>
<br><b>tall being, about 7 feet tall, in a bluish black robe. I called
my Mom in fear</b>
<br><b>and I slept with her the rest of the week. Nothing seemed to happen
to us</b>
<br><b>again, until we moved downstairs when I was about 7 years old. When
my family was</b>
<br><b>talking about ghosts during dinner, the phone cord started shaking</b>
<br><b>violently and stopped only when we stopped talking. That was the
last thing that</b>
<br><b>happened until a few years later, I was 13 years old and everyone
was</b>
<br><b>asleep, we had just brought a mirror from upstairs to our downstairs,
that night,</b>
<br><b>it began to scream. A blood curdling scream came from my parents
room where</b>
<br><b>the mirror was placed, and my father and mother both woke up in
shock, my</b>
<br><b>father claims the mirror was glowing. Now, a few weeks ago, the
screaming had</b>
<br><b>returned. In the middle of the night a screaming came from my parents
room</b>
<br><b>and only my mother awoke, so scared she ran into my sisters room
to sleep</b>
<br><b>with her for the rest of the night. That same night, around 3:00
AM, I</b>
<br><b>woke up and looked to my doorway, and I saw what looked to be a
white</b>
<br><b>translucent figure, about 5 feet tall, just staring towards me,
well I can't tell if</b>
<br><b>it was looking at me, but I had that strange feeling. Thinking nothing
of it,</b>
<br><b>and not knowing of what happened in my parents room that night,
I fell</b>
<br><b>fast asleep and tried not to think about it. The next morning, my
parents told</b>
<br><b>me about the screams they heard last night, and I suddenly remembered
what I</b>
<br><b>had saw, and I had a sickening feeling in my chest, knowing, I had
seen</b>
<br><b>another ghost. Nothing has happened since then, but I believe something
will very</b>
<br><b>soon. If ANYONE has any experiences similar to the ones I have talked</b>
<br><b>about, please, e-mail me at tegu2001@aol.com it is interesting to
see who else</b>
<br><b>goes through these ghostly experiences.</b><b></b>

<p><b>The Lady in Gray</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: Auburn278@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;One night I was over a friend's house sitting alone in his
basement</b>
<br><b>bedroom while he took a shower.&nbsp; No one else was in the house
besides the</b>
<br><b>dog who happened to be asleep on the bed.&nbsp; I had the TV on
so that there would</b>
<br><b>be some noise in the creepy, dim basement.&nbsp; His house was very
old, about 150</b>
<br><b>years old to be exact and had an aura of otherwordliness.&nbsp;
His parents had</b>
<br><b>restored the house and decorated it in the Victorian style.&nbsp;
Anything</b>
<br><b>modern was carefully disguised.&nbsp; The only rooms that were modern
were the kitchen</b>
<br><b>and my friend's bedroom.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; He had been in the shower for about 10 mins when I
heard his front</b>
<br><b>door open.&nbsp; I thought this odd because no one should have been
coming over.</b>
<br><b>His parents were out of the country and his sister was over her
boyfriends.</b>
<br><b>Assuming that it must have been his sister, I walked upstairs.&nbsp;
The front</b>
<br><b>door was standing wide open, but there was no sign of anyone in
the house.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I felt the hair on the back of my neck stand
up as I closed the door</b>
<br><b>and turned around to walk back downstairs.&nbsp; Suddenly I caught
a glimpse of</b>
<br><b>something gray out of the corner of my eye and turned around so
fast I</b>
<br><b>almost fell.&nbsp; Standing beside the stairs was a barely visible
woman dressed in</b>
<br><b>dark gray, wearing a bonnet and carrying something in her hands.&nbsp;
I blinked my</b>
<br><b>eyes and shook my head, praying to God that I was seeing things,
but she</b>
<br><b>was still there.&nbsp; I was speechless.&nbsp; I had seen things
I couldn't explain</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;before... even a few that could have been ghosts, but she
looked like a</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;projection.&nbsp; I could see right through her, but she was
mostly visible.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My friend opened the bathroom door to see
me staring at his staircase</b>
<br><b>like an idiot.&nbsp; He asked me if I was ok and I looked at him
and started to</b>
<br><b>laugh.&nbsp; I'm sure he thought I was losing my mind.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I told him what I had seen and he paled
visibly.&nbsp; He then told me that</b>
<br><b>his mother and sister had seen her at the bottom of the steps, usually</b>
<br><b>after hearing the front door open.&nbsp; I finally got him to admit
that he saw her</b>
<br><b>once on the upstairs landing.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have been over his house many times since,
but besides the</b>
<br><b>occasional feeling that someone is there or walking through a cold
spot I haven't</b>
<br><b>seen the Lady in Gray since.</b>

<p><b>The Devil (a dream turning to reality)</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: AngelaB168958504@cs.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;My grandmother is in the old folks home as some people call
it.&nbsp; Sometimes</b>
<br><b>I go and pick her up to stay the weekend with me.&nbsp; She can't
walk on her</b>
<br><b>own. Well, I picked her up about two weeks ago.&nbsp; She was very
surprised about</b>
<br><b>my new house but she didn't want to stay here for some strange reason.&nbsp;
So I</b>
<br><b>promised to take her back the very next day.&nbsp; That night I
put her in the</b>
<br><b>bed and she fell asleep almost instantly.&nbsp; I stayed up for
a while and watched</b>
<br><b>TV.&nbsp; As I was watching Mad TV, I saw something move out of
the corner of</b>
<br><b>my eye and go into the restroom which you can see from the living
room.&nbsp; It</b>
<br><b>looked like a white cloud or something.&nbsp; I was dumb and followed
trying to</b>
<br><b>be nosy.&nbsp; It disappeared into thin air and I felt my hair on
my arms rise as</b>
<br><b>a cold chill or wind pass me.&nbsp; I just stood there for a while
in shock like</b>
<br><b>I can't believe what I just saw.&nbsp; I saw a real looking cloud
in my house and</b>
<br><b>it disappeared, when I thought about it I stood there and screamed
(don't ask</b>
<br><b>me why it took so long for me to scream).&nbsp; I had to hurry up
and shut-up</b>
<br><b>before would wake up my grandmother.&nbsp; I went to sleep, but
first I called my best</b>
<br><b>friend for some comfort.&nbsp; I had a weird dream that a fine man
came out of</b>
<br><b>my closet, I mean the best looking man I have ever seen.&nbsp; He
sat on the end</b>
<br><b>of my bed.&nbsp; He asked me how was I doing.&nbsp; I told him fine.&nbsp;
He came a little</b>
<br><b>closer and I got a little scared.&nbsp; He told me not to be scared
that he was</b>
<br><b>my dream man.&nbsp; He came a little closer.&nbsp; And I started
to run but I didn't</b>
<br><b>(because you know this part is a dream right) then he asked me if
I</b>
<br><b>believed in God, and he came closer and I saw his eyes they were
just black holes</b>
<br><b>and a worm started crawling out his nose.&nbsp; I told him I wanted
him to leave</b>
<br><b>and he went back into the closet.&nbsp; I woke up in a sweat and
opened my door to</b>
<br><b>find my grandmother sitting in a chair at my door with a Bible in
her</b>
<br><b>hand. I asked her what was she doing there and how did she walk
all the way to</b>
<br><b>my room alone.&nbsp; She said she saw the devil walk in my room
and had to pray</b>
<br><b>for me.&nbsp; She never answered the question about how she walked
to my room and</b>
<br><b>has not walked without help in about three years.</b>

<p><b>Blue Orb</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: The Howe Family</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Presently I am 19 years old. And as a child I knew there were spirits
but I did not think that they could visit us or that they could be seen.&nbsp;
On several occasions I have seen a circular like blue ball. It would hover
in one section of the livingroom and them suddenly shoot off into to no
where. I was told "oh your just seeing things"etc. I believed that until
my 13 year old brother,and 4 of my good friends have seen the same thing.
I do not know if they were ghosts or not. Another time I was washing dishes
in our kitchen and I was home alone. I was listening to the radio on a
rather low volume. Then all of a sudden the volume was cranked up. I looked
at the volume knob and It was turned. At this point I was starting to believe.
I have on several occasions heard my name called whaen nobody else in my
home was calling me, I have seen things out of the corner of my eye, I
have had horrible dreams about ghosts and evil spirits. And so much has
happened in between. It is at the point where I will do anything not to
be left alone. On some nights I have went to bed terrified and I don't
even know why. I was so scared of something that I was shaking. Some nights
i do not even want to go to bed. I have stayed up until 4:00am until it
started to get day light out. I often have dreams of my deceased grandfather
an grandmother, whom I was really close to. I hope I do not sound crazy
to you but there are very few people I can tell.And Iknow for a fact that
they might even exsist. my best friend who has no religion has reported
to me that she thinks that there is something in her home. Sometimes her
dog acts weird as does mine. She hears pepole taling in her basement when
no one is home and no TV's or radios are on. Too may events have happened
to me and others for me not to beleive in ghosts. I</b>
<br><b>BELIEVE!</b>

<p><b>Odd Experience</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: watcher_29@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>I was at my part-time job at a local Kansas City</b>
<br><b>wholesale club. I work in the cafe, and had already</b>
<br><b>closed up for the night. I was cleaning up in</b>
<br><b>preparation to go home, and had cleaned everything</b>
<br><b>except for the frozen beverage machine, which I had</b>
<br><b>forgotten all about.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, a number of lids for the frozen</b>
<br><b>beverages, which were on top of the machine, fell off</b>
<br><b>onto the floor, drawing my attention to the machine.</b>
<br><b>There was no movement of air in the club, and no one</b>
<br><b>else was in the kitchen. The lids were pretty securely</b>
<br><b>placed on top of the unit, within reach, but not in</b>
<br><b>any place where they would teeter and fall on their</b>
<br><b>own. I felt that "someone" had knocked the lids off.</b>
<br><b>When I went over to pick them up, I saw that I had not</b>
<br><b>cleaned the frozen beverage machine. I would have been</b>
<br><b>in a lot of trouble the next day, because the machine</b>
<br><b>would have been very sticky and nigh impossible to</b>
<br><b>clean. I can only conclude that some spirit was</b>
<br><b>reminding me to clean that machine.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe that it was one of the ghosts
from my</b>
<br><b>house, who sometimes follow me around. However, one</b>
<br><b>girl who worked there before I did told me she feels</b>
<br><b>that the club itself may have a ghost.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The date and time this happened was May
6, 2000,</b>
<br><b>about 8:30 pm. There was a very rare planetary</b>
<br><b>alignment going on, BTW. Only happens once every 400</b>
<br><b>years or so.</b><b></b>

<p><b>&nbsp;hello, my name is sara and I live in winter haven florida,
about three</b>
<br><b>years ago I was visiting my aunt just a few miles away and she had
claimed to</b>
<br><b>hear her dead friend in her house all the time I was not sure weather
to</b>
<br><b>believe her or not. but one night my cousin and I were watching

<br><b>room and we heard a party in the living room I mean people and music
and</b>
<br><b>it was really kinda loud when we got up to see what was going on
the music</b>
<br><b>stopped and there was nothing there. from then on I noticed other
things</b>
<br><b>like hearing bells, the radio comming on by its self ,electricity
going on and</b>
<br><b>off in the kitchen,cold spots, and other things that were out of
the ordinary.</b>
<br><b>those things soon became normal to us. I also&nbsp; saw a ghost
when I was a</b>

it all now I</b>
<br><b>know that i didnt. I also am no longer afraid of spirits and they
come to</b>

<br><b>My Worst Fear</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Cheryl Fletcher</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Four years ago my husband, Danny, and I moved
into my deceased great great great grandfather's house.&nbsp; My family
had always considered it haunted, but we needed some place to stay, and
my husband and I were interested in the challenge of "fixing it up".&nbsp;
We spent about three months wallpapering, painting, and carpeting.&nbsp;
During those three months we found many things missing, or as Danny called
it, misplaced.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When everything was ready, we moved in.&nbsp;
One night I was alone in the house.&nbsp; Danny was on a business trip.&nbsp;
I am a very heavy sleeper, but one night suddenly awoke.&nbsp;&nbsp; My
room was so cold I could hardly breathe.&nbsp; I looked towards the window,
expecting to find it open, but instead I found a thin, young women with
long black hair.&nbsp; At first I was alarmed, but then I had a odd feeling
of comfort by the women.&nbsp; She seemed very familiar.&nbsp; I knew that
I had never met her in my life, but it was almost as if I had met her in
a dream. At first she just stood there, watching me.&nbsp; Then she slowly
got up and motioned me to follow her.&nbsp; I was still very cold, but
I got up out of bed and followed her.&nbsp; She would drift in and out
of my sight.&nbsp; As I was following her, I noticed a familiar scent.&nbsp;
Like roses and lavander.&nbsp; I couldn't make myself remember where I
had smelled that before.&nbsp; She continued to walk and motion me to follow
her.&nbsp; She was soon opening the door to the atic, my worst fear.&nbsp;
For some reason, I wasn't afraid that night.&nbsp; In the atic I found
all of the items that came up missing, and a journal of my great great
great grandmother.&nbsp; Tucked away in the journal was a map to a spot
on our land.&nbsp; There we found pure gold underground.&nbsp; My ancestors
had buried it during the rush, because they were already wealthy enough.&nbsp;&nbsp;
If it wasn't for that night I don't know how things would be that day.</b>

<p><b>Haunting in Malta</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: rosan@csc.um.edu.mt</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>My name is Rosanne and I live in Malta, a small island in the</b>
<br><b>Mediterranean.&nbsp; I never thought I would be here telling people
about my</b>
<br><b>experiences but after reading all the true stories, they somewhat</b>
<br><b>convinced me to write.</b><b></b>
<p><b>A few years ago my friend of mine and myself went out to have some
fun.</b>
<br><b>It was Saturday evening and we went to the playingfield to have
some</b>
<br><b>"childish" fun.&nbsp; There were 3 swings, I was on the first one,
my friend was in the</b>
<br><b>middle and the last one was empty.&nbsp; As we were swinging to
and fro the</b>
<br><b>last swing began to swing by itself.&nbsp; Simple solution you would
say...the top</b>
<br><b>rod holding the swings was being moved in a way that moved the swing
too.&nbsp; But</b>
<br><b>it wasn't like that at all.&nbsp; The swing was kinda following
my friend's</b>
<br><b>swing, exactly the same movements.&nbsp; And the best thing is that
when we</b>
<br><b>shifted places and did the same thing again the swing did not move
at all.</b>
<br><b>We got really scared and we ran home.&nbsp; To this day we cannot
find a</b>
<br><b>rational explanation to it.&nbsp; We were the same age and approximately
the same</b>
<br><b>weight.</b>
<br><b>Anyway another thing happened to me a few years after this incident.&nbsp;
It</b>
<br><b>was a hot summer night.&nbsp; I could not sleep with the heat and
I decided to</b>
<br><b>fetch a blanket a sleep on the floor, right opposite my bed, just
beneath the</b>
<br><b>window opposite the bed for some fresh air.&nbsp; I was fast asleep
when I was</b>
<br><b>awaken by a strange feeling of being watched and looked up and saw
a very</b>
<br><b>handsome man sitting on the foot of my bed, with a slightly smiling
face.</b>
<br><b>He was all in black, his hair long and black.&nbsp; He was sort
of beckoning me</b>
<br><b>to him by his staring, black eyes.&nbsp; I spoke of this incident
to a friend</b>
<br><b>of mine -this guy was once part of a satanic sect, he practised
black magic</b>
<br><b>and so forth, but at that time he had already quitted, so I asked
him.&nbsp; He</b>
<br><b>asked me if this "guy's" hand were like that of a goat, but I don't
remember</b>
<br><b>this guy as having these kind of hands, although I am not sure.&nbsp;
All I can say</b>
<br><b>is that he was extremely enchanting.</b>
<br><b>Another incident I cannot possible find a rational explanation to
is that</b>
<br><b>one evening me and my sister were getting ready to go to bed.&nbsp;
We lived</b>
<br><b>and still do in the same house.&nbsp; My sister's room is exactly
opposite mine so</b>
<br><b>our doors are exaclty opposite each other.&nbsp; My sister is afraid
of the</b>
<br><b>dark and she never sleeps in complete darkness.&nbsp; She was switching
on the night</b>
<br><b>light that night but something went wrong and she felt a small shock</b>
<br><b>tingling in her fingers.&nbsp; She got scared and shouted.&nbsp;
At that same</b>
<br><b>moment, in a split of a second she saw a white shadow moving swiftly
from her and</b>
<br><b>out of her room and at that same precise moment I saw it too in
my room.</b>
<br><b>As we were preparing to go to bed neither me nor my sis had closed
the door</b>
<br><b>for the night and so this kind of energy passed from her room to
mine.&nbsp; It</b>
<br><b>vanished immediately, only visible for a split of a second.&nbsp;
But anyway</b>
<br><b>neither me nor her, to this day are able to explain this.</b>
<br><b>And one last thing.&nbsp; At my boyfriend's home I always get the
feeling of a</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;presence, not malice at all but I feel it is a powerful presence.&nbsp;
I feel</b>
<br><b>it most in the first room of the house, just after you enter the
house.</b>
<br><b>There's a chair and I feel it always sits on it.&nbsp; But even
in my</b>
<br><b>boyfriend's room I feel it. Once I was chatting with someone on
the computer and I was</b>
<br><b>alone in my boyfriend's room when all of a sudden I got startled
by some</b>
<br><b>kind of presence in the room and I turned around but obviously there
was</b>
<br><b>no one.&nbsp; And also my boyfriend's dog always stares in the direction
of this</b>
<br><b>chair and when she does so I look keenly at her and she seems to
be</b>
<br><b>looking eagerly at something or someone in the direction of this
chair. My</b>
<br><b>boyfriend's grandmother moved in this house to live with them when
her</b>
<br><b>husband (grandad) died and I feel that this presence is his spirit
looking</b>
<br><b>over her.&nbsp; In his life he used to love her a lot but died suddenly
over a</b>
<br><b>week with a stroke.</b>
<br><b>I hope you find my experiences interesting.&nbsp; And I thank you.</b><b></b>

<br><b>My Cousin</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: kwits5@juno.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;When I was about 10, my cousin Eddie died very suddenly in
a car crash.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;He died a month before his brother Jack's wedding, where he
was supposed</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;to be the best-man.&nbsp; After his death, Jack and Peggy
( his fiance)</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;decided to have Jack's other younger brother, Bart, to be
the best-man.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Nothing weird happened until a couple years after the wedding.&nbsp;
In 1995,</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Jack and Peggy had their first child.&nbsp; That summer we
went to see Jack,</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Peg, and the new baby.&nbsp;&nbsp; My whole family was there
and we decided that</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;since everyone was there, we should call Bart and tell him
to come over.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;He lives far away, so while we were waiting, we put the baby
to bed.&nbsp; We</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;were all sitting in the living room and I was sitting in a
chair, closest</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;to the front door.&nbsp; About an hour later, we heard a knocking
at the door.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; I looked at the door and saw the screen door open.&nbsp;
A second later, my</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;dad went to the door. While he opened it, he said, " How's
it going Bart</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;. . ."&nbsp; There was no one there! My dad went out on the
lawn and looked</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;down the street in both directions to see if anyone was running(
you know</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;how kids are!)&nbsp; No one was there. We thought that maybe
Bart was playing</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;a trick and went to the back door.&nbsp; So we ran to it,
and nobody was</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;there.&nbsp; Bart's truck wasn't there either.&nbsp;&nbsp;
That's when I started getting</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;chills.&nbsp; I felt cold all of a sudden.&nbsp; I was really
freaked out.&nbsp; And</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;just as the cold chill had come so suddenly, it felt like
it moved away.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I did not want to move, but I&nbsp; had to go to the bathroom
really bad (</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;don't worry, this is going somewhere).&nbsp; In order to get
to the bathroom,</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;you have to walk past the baby's room.&nbsp; So I checked
on him.&nbsp; When I</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;looked into the room, it felt very peaceful in there, as if
I really</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;didn't need to check on the baby.&nbsp; Later that night,
Bart showed up.&nbsp; We</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;told him what had happened and he didn't know what to think
of it. My dad</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;was the one who figured that it must have been Eddie; he said
he must</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;have come to join the party too.&nbsp; I mean, it must have
been him because</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;that was the only time all of us had been together since the
wedding.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;As their baby got older, they noticed some very weird things
that he</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;would do.&nbsp; He would stare into space and look as if he
was talking to</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;someone!&nbsp; He did that for a long time, and I'm sure it
was Eddie.&nbsp; I</b>

<p><b>Little Black Dog</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: ND6274@webv.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;Hi, my name is Patricia Chastain, I live in Lucerne ,Cal. I
moved into</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;my house two years ago and i have a little black ghost dog
that lives</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;here with us. He only comes out at night and&nbsp; the most
we can see him is</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;at inter time. At first i didnt believe my son when he told
me that a</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;little black dog is here with us, But one night as i was standing</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;leaning on my couch looking at the t.v. I notice a shadow
come running</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;around the sofa and run in front of it and disappear . I thought
one of</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;the other dogs were in the house and i looked and didnt see
no dog. My</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;hair raised a little ,i had experienced like this before in
Santa Rosa,</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Cal. We name the little dog magik,so far he hasnt been back
,but my son</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;says he sees him once in awhile. This&nbsp; true and i also
had a spirit</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;living with us in Santa Rosa,Cal. At our other house we had
a man spirit</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;living with us. He looked like he was in the 18 hundreds,
lean, with a</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;top hat and full beard.At one time hen my son was sleeping
in the back</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;room(which is a build on) i heard him crying and i got up
to see what</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;was wrong. I had to pass the fron room and the kictchen and
then a small</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;hall way and i saw this man sitting on his bed patting the
bed. When he</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;saw me he got up and and walked two,three steps and disappeaed.
I froze</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;and couldnt move i couldnt even walk in the back room. After
awhile i</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;walk in but my son was a sleep again. This spirit stayed with
us every</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;since we lived there.. I am a piece and do little spells here
and there</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;and was told that i can be wicca if i wanted, but i just read
up on</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;them, i have for 8 years now. I have perdicted my fathers
death in 1975.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;My mom can tell you that one because she was warned of his
death and</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;told family members early . He died three months after i dreamed
his</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;death&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I will tell you more about that in the next page.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I think i filled this one up .</b>

<p><b>I feel it is Haunted</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: NiMRoDGiRL99@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;Hi, my name is Carissa, im using my friend's screenname. I
just wanted to</b>
<br><b>let you know that i really like your site. And i have a story for
you ghost</b>
<br><b>section. It really hasn't been proven to be haunted, but i can feel
it is.</b>
<br><b>And my friend, Anna, who has seen some things, can tell you too.
O.K., the</b>
<br><b>first encounter was two years ago, halloween. I had a blow up frankenstein</b>
<br><b>for the front of our house as a decoration. The next morning after
blowing</b>
<br><b>it up, it deflated. No holes, nothing. and the plug was still in.
And i also</b>
<br><b>have a bride of frankenstein cardboard thing (which i really hate,
because</b>
<br><b>its eyes follow you) and one day i found its head on the floor.
It looked</b>
<br><b>like someone cut it with some type of strange scissor. Plus, i found
what</b>
<br><b>looked like blood on her neck. But it cardboard, cardboard doesn't
bleed.</b>
<br><b>And when my friend, Anna slept over with a few other friends my
light whent on</b>
<br><b>by itself, then it whent off. I think it was trying to scare Anna
because i</b>
<br><b>told her about it and she freaked. And on my mirror, which is still
there today</b>
<br><b>(im to afraid to touch it) are hand prints. like they scratched&nbsp;
it with</b>
<br><b>there fingers and hit their palm down.&nbsp; and my friend and I
are always</b>
<br><b>scared of the basement, like being there alone, we feel like its
right behind us,</b>
<br><b>we feel its presents. Mainly in the basement, and sometimes in my
room. And</b>
<br><b>the least is My guest room, and attic. Now the house was built around
25 years</b>
<br><b>ago. My grandpa designed it and had it built by his company. its
not built</b>
<br><b>over a burial ground and no ones died in it.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Haunted Houses</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: eireland@delanet.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>I bought my house 13 years ago in Center City Wilmington, Delaware.
My</b>
<br><b>neighborhood was built in the 1850's so it is concievable what I
have</b>
<br><b>experienced is for real.</b><b></b>
<p><b>I live in 2-two story row houses that are inter connected. Historically</b>
<br><b>I can only go back to the 1930's. My house was a candy store then
non</b>
<br><b>denominational church then privately owned until 1987 when I bought
this</b>
<br><b>house.</b><b></b>
<p><b>I live primarily on the first floor and sometimes when I am alone
or</b>
<br><b>when my former girlfriend would stay here with me we would hear
foot</b>
<br><b>steps walking down the hallway of the second floor. The last experience</b>
<br><b>happened about 2 months ago when I thought my house mate was here
and</b>
<br><b>said " hey Steve, bring me down,,," No reply. Dawned on me ...happened</b>
<br><b>again....*sigh*</b><b></b>
<p><b>On 1 ocassion a former housemate and girlfriend witnessed papers
blown</b>
<br><b>of his desk in his room in the dead of a cold winter when all the</b>
<br><b>windows are shut.</b><b></b>
<p><b>I am grateful for the fact the prescence walks down the hallway and</b>
<br><b>stops at the top of the stairs but doesnt come down. I don't get
a</b>
<br><b>feeling of it being male or female; in fact I try to ignore it as
much</b>
<br><b>as possible...don't want to give it un-neccessary energy/attention.</b><b></b>
<p><b>I don't want ghost busters contacting me or stirring things up in
my</b>
<br><b>house. Nothing i can do about it, it is a peaceful co-existence.
I just</b>
<br><b>wanted to share my story.</b>

<br><b>HANDS AND FINGERS</b><b></b>

<p><b>&nbsp;Hi, my name is Christy.&nbsp; I am from TN.&nbsp; I just wanted
to share my story</b>
<br><b>with everyone.&nbsp; Actually, I have experienced quite a bit of
hauntings in my</b>
<br><b>home but I will tell you the one that frightened me the most.&nbsp;
O.K. here it</b>
<br><b>goes. I had just gone to bed one night.&nbsp; I have a day bed and
I always lay on my</b>
<br><b>back and put my arms through the bars and let them hang off of the
bed.</b>
<br><b>Well, when I laid down it was almost as soon as I had hung my arms
off,</b>
<br><b>something grabbed my hands.&nbsp; I could feel the fingers and had
to jerk my</b>
<br><b>hands away because whatever it was, was holding my hands really
tight.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>turned on my lamp, looked around the room and under my bed, nothing
was</b>
<br><b>there.&nbsp; I COULD FEEL FINGERS!!!&nbsp; I woke my mom and dad
up because I was</b>
<br><b>walking out of the room backwards wimpering.&nbsp; My mom was scared
because of</b>
<br><b>the look I had.&nbsp; Then I just started crying so hard because
I was so</b>
<br><b>scared. I slept with my sisters that night.&nbsp; And needless to
say, I have never</b>
<br><b>ever slept with a body part hanging off the bed after that.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Ghosts of Peachtree-Battle Park</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: thomas weeks</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>probably twenty years ago, i worked at a nightclub in the buckhead
area of atlanta.&nbsp; after hours, many of us would get together after
the clubs had closed and eat breakfast or just hang out.&nbsp; one night
while wandering around , my roommate and i happened to find ourselves going
down collier road and soon came upon&nbsp; The Peachtree Battle Park.&nbsp;
this is an area where some particularly ferocious and bloody fighting took
place during the battle for atlanta during the civil war.&nbsp; it was
an eery looking place to behold at night and my roommate and i thought
that we could have a little fun by bringing our girlfriends down here and
scaring them.&nbsp; we decided to explore the park first by ourselves.&nbsp;
as it was in the middle of the night, we found ourselves groping about
in the dark.&nbsp; we distinctly noticed strange mists floating about (
not banks of fog-but separate wisps of mist).&nbsp; you could also feel
abrupt temperture changes (you could feel a cold chill in the air that
would disappear just as quickly as it appeared).&nbsp; while we had initially
entered this place just to check it out, we soon found ourselves feeling
like we were being checked out.&nbsp; well enough of this, and we left.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
several nights later we brought our girlfriends and went&nbsp; back to
the park to see what they felt.&nbsp; while we did let them know that this
location had been the scene of a bloody battle, we did not relate our own
personal&nbsp; feelings from a few nights back.&nbsp; it was readily apparent,
however, when we went back into the field that the girls were feeling things
too.&nbsp; this time,however, it felt different.&nbsp; the cold spots and
feelings that we were being watched were almost overwhelming as if whatever
was there had decided it was not pleased with us being there.&nbsp; you
could just feel it as if they were trying to take hold of you.&nbsp; the
further we proceeded the more uncomfortable we all were beginning to feel.&nbsp;
we decided that it was time to leave.&nbsp; we had parked the car in the
entrance to the park which was blocked off by a large chain stretched between
two concrete posts.&nbsp; the</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;closer we got to the car the more pursued and frightened we
felt.&nbsp; when we finally reached the gate, we wasted no time getting
into the car&nbsp; .&nbsp; as i started the car one of the girls said--look
at the chain.&nbsp; this large and heavy chain was bouncing around as if
it&nbsp; was being angrily shaken by some unseen hands that were either
glad that we were leaving or mad that we had gotten away.&nbsp; this would
have been the end of this story except for that later that night after
i had dropped my girlfriend off, i went home and went to bed.&nbsp; i had
probably been asleep for perhaps an hour when suddenly i awoke and felt
something pushing down on my chest and holding me down in bed.&nbsp; my
first thought was an intruder was in my home..&nbsp; with a surge of adrenalin
i struggled free and flipped around to face my attacker------there was
no one there.&nbsp;&nbsp; i&nbsp; will forever believe that whatever it
was that was holding me down was something that had followed me home from
the park.......i have never been back.</b>
