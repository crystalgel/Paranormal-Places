was Little my mom and brother
lived at my grandmother's house for a short while.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I would sleep on the couch and my brother
would sleep on the floor sometimes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
would wake up in the middle of the night and see a pirate ghost in full
collars.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I usually ended up under the
couch cushions until day break.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I still
remember waking up and being so scared that I'd dive under the couch
cushions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Pirate only watched me, he
never tried to
hurt me at all. I just did not know why he was there.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Some have told me that they think that he was
my guardian angel there to protect me.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He would always stay at the door just looking at me. sometimes
I'd get a
little brave and look over the cushions to see if he was still there,
and of
course he was just staring at me. Then about a year ago there was two
big ghost
dogs in my room on my bed, they were very friendly, but that is another
story.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

dont know if you would cal this
something in supernatural or entity or something like that, but in 1996
my
grandpa had a dream. he was getting open heart surgery and my grandmas
sisters
husband was giving it to him in the dream, the funny poart is that he
was
wearing something similar to a butcher apron and it ha dsomething
written of a
local deli. he woke up and asked my grandma if my great-uncle had
worked as a
butcher and she said yes. almost a year later he had a heart attack and
had to
have open heart surgery. we have always said in the family that he had
predicted his heart attack.i have had 1 other unnexplainable yet scary
dream i
was at my grandmas house, the same as above and was working upstairs on
my
computer. i felt a hand brush my shoulder, i felt a little bit alarmed
because
they were out shopping (in the dream anyway) and i thought maybe it was
just
the cat since they had one, but it barely moved since it was extremely
old so i
went looking for whatever had brushed me and when i had reached the top
of the
stairs, opposite side then they are supposed to be (in the dream) and i
saw
this old lady she was probably in her 70s just standing there,<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>i tried to get her attention and also ask her
why she would be in the house and her eyes turned evil red. i screamed,
and i
probably did outside the dream as well and then i woke up. i kind of
forgot the
dream until later that day i was littler then about 8 when i saw it and
i dont
know if anyone believed me. if anyone has any weird other dreams send
them to
me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

 style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Hello!
I've put up a couple of
stories here before, and I thought I might contribute a few more! As a
little
kid I saw ghosts a lot, but as the years went by I lost the ability to
see
them, though I can talk to them and feel them. Any ways, now that I
sound
completely crazy, I'll tell you about a few of the ghosts I interacted
with as
a kid.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When I was about five or six
years old I lived in a one bedroom apartment and shared the room with
my little
sister and mother. I had the top bunk and both my mom and sister slept
like the
dead. One night I was just getting ready to settle down, my cat
fruitloop had
jumped on the bed and was curled around my head as was his habit. I was
petting
him and getting tired when I heard a 'psssst! Hey!' in a quiet whisper.
My eyes
snapped open and I sat up. A boy about my age (maybe seven?) was
leaning over
the foot of my bed. His skin was blue, his hair black. I didn't think
much of
it because the way the lighting in the room was, it made everything
look blue
and black. The boy asked me to come out and play and I told him it was
late and
mommy wanted me to sleep. The boy said "just for a few minutes. Come
on,
lets go!" I told him I could, but I would play with him tomorrow. He
said
"ookaaaay" and then climbed down. I remember leaning over the side of
the bed watching him leave the room. It wasn't until I was older and
looked
back that I realized he'd gone half way through the door, because my
mom has
this habit (even today) of leaving a door more than half closed, so
that you
can't slip all the way through (even as a kid) without bumping it or
opening it
to make room. I remember the door never moved.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A few years later, when I was 9, my school went to the San Juan
Capistrano Mission, in Southern California as a school field trip about
our
local history. As my group was looking around I trailed behind and
began to
wander around by myself--figuring I could find them again. I walked
around a
trail and found myself at the ruins of where a part of mission had
crumbled in
one of our larger earthquakes. I got this bad feeling and something in
me said
'go away right now' I remember running and then being scared because I
couldn't
find my group and I was completely alone. I looked around and there,
standing
beneath a bougainvillea (or roses...all I know is the flowers were red)
was a
monk. Brown robe, rope belt, and balding head. I was very relieved (and
also a
very talkative and outgoing child) and walked over to him. I remember
saying "Excuse
me, do you know where my group is?" And he nodded his head and pointed.
I
followed the point and saw he was pointing beyond a turn.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Oh, they're over there?" He nodded
and pointed again. I smiled and said thank you and skipped my way
around the
corner and almost slammed into my teacher. She'd been searching for me
for the
past ten minutes and was a little more than frazzled. She told me not
to wander
off like that, that they'd almost left without me! I said I was sorry,
that I
had gotten lost, but that the 'nice monk had helped me.'<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>"What monk?" She'd asked,
annoyed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The one by the roses
(They WERE roses! I just remembered!)."<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>She told me that there were no monks
here, and to not make stuff up. However our tour guide pulled me aside.
I
remember what she looked like because her hair was early nineties
fantastic,
permed and blond and hair sprayed in a high pony tail. She asked me if
I'd
really seen the monk. I tearfully told her yes I had, as I was very
upset my
teacher thought I lied. She smiled and put a hand on my shoulder and
leaned in
close and said, "Honey, you just saw a ghost." Needless to stay I was
stunned. "Your a very lucky little girl you know, he doesn't show
himself
to every one. He must have really liked you." I was so happy to know
that,
that I didn't even mind when my teacher told my mom I needed to listen
to
instructions a bit better when I got home!<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The very last time I physically saw a ghost was when I was 12
years old.
Sadly, it is not as friendly or funny as my last two stories. I was up
at what
my dad and I call 'the ranch', which is a 20 acre piece of property we
own at
the base of the sierra mountains. My dad was building a deck so that we
could
look over the pretty river of which we own a portion. I was off towards
the stream,
just barely out of view of my dad. I had gotten it in my head that<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I wanted to be a native american (I had
honest to goodness hand made moccasins a bow and arrows, and my dad had
been
nice enough to teach me how to track animals), and that obviously,
native
americans caught fish with their hands, which is what I would do too!
(Obviously, they didn't do such things, but I was young and reading
Beaver
Creek...). I was leaning over the stream trying to catch minnows when I
felt
some one staring at me. I turned my head to the right and there,
standing upon
a slightly dirty white-ish horse was a native american boy about 16 to
my 12.
He had bucksking leggings, but no shirt, and his hair was actually
short,
coming to his jaw line. I smiled and said 'hi!'. He narrowed his eyes
at me and
frowned. I remember being surprised because normally, people liked me.
I told
him my name and started to stand a little from my crouch and he
narrowed his
eyes further and drew from his back an arrow, which he deftly knotched
onto his
bow. I remember thinking 'he's not going to SHOOT that.' I started to
get
nervous when he trained it on me and I realized he was very serious. I
remember
standing up then and screaming "DAAAAD!" and just as I took my first
step I heard the 'thwok' of an arrow being released and I screamed.<span
 style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I came tearing through
the small bank of
trees and met my dead half way, crying. He asked what was going
on--thinking
I'd been bitten by a rattle snake--and I cried that a native american (
i said
in 'indian' at the time, but I know better now! Thanks high school!)
had tried
to shoot me. My dad looked dubious and told me to show me where. I took
him
back and told him of how he was on a horse and all that had transpired.
He
looked for tracks but none of the fallen leaves was disturbed and he
only found
deer tracks. He didn't tell me I was crazy or making it up, but he
didn't quite
believe me either. It took me nearly a week before I would go back down
to the
creek/river, and I have never seen him again. Thank you for taking the
time to
read these! <o:p></o:p></span></p>

live in Ocala,Florida,and I
was browsing your website looking at the haunted places in my town.One
of them
caught my eye.The old Silver Springs Shores Hotel.I am not too sure
where it
was located,as info on the hotel is hard to come by.However there is an
abandoned parking lot off of Maricamp Road(464).It is very overgrown.I
believe
this is where the hotel once stood,but I am not sure.My dad used to
live in the
area,and we would sometimes pass the abandoned parking lot on our way
to a
local ice cream shop.I was about 13-14 back then,and I remember
everytime I
went by there.I got this feeling of uneasiness.I didn't want to be near
that
lace.There was one occurence were we passed by there at night,and I
felt like
something was watching me from the overgrowth in the distance.The
uneasiness
was much worse at night.I drove by there a couple months ago myself,and
got the
same uneasy feeling as I did before.I'm not sure if it's the same
location,but
it seems to relate.I had these experiences before I even knew there was
once a
hotel in the shores.There is definitely something about that parking
lot,whether it's where the hotel once was or not. I loved your site,and
found
it a great resource.Keep up the good work!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

 style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">* Sadly
we experienced all this
stuff around the ago of 13 , 12 , and 11 *Me and Sister was having a
sleepover
at my house<span style="">&nbsp; </span>with our 2 best friends
..Courtney and Hannah .<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sadly my little
brother Kyle was home and me and my friends had to babysit him<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So
we ended up watching him and eventually ( after many hours ) he feel
asleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Me and my friends were soo
happy. LOL. So we decided to lay him down on his bed .<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When i walked in my brothers room i felt
uncomfortable in a way , like i was being watched or something.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I decided to ignore the feeling and put kyle
on his bed immediatley. All of a sudden a cold breeze entered the room.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>And thatg was very unusual because our house
was very hot and humid that night. And the A.C. wasnt on.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I got scared and once kyle was on the bed i
immediatley ran out the room. That room had a very unwanted presence.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>In genral it wasnt a good feeling at all.
Once i finally reached my sister's room with Hannah and Courtney ,<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>they noticed<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>that i was basically terrified. They all were concerned for me.
So
ofcourse they started asking me questions like<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>'' r u ok ? ,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>u look like u seen
a ghost and ...ect. '' I didnt want the girls to worry so i just told
them that
i saw a bug and<span style="">&nbsp; </span>got scared.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They laughed and we went on having fun . Then
a few hours passed , Nearly midnight and i went to go check up on kyle.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Once i entered<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the
room it was warm at first. But as i got
closer to kyle i noticed that he was twitching and shivering.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Then again i started to get that Being
watched feeling again. And this time i was terrified.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>So i decided that i wasnt goona leave kyle
there. So i tried to wake him up , but no matter how much i shook him or<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>how loud i yelled or screamed he wouldnt wake
up. This is very unusual for my brother because he is a VERY light
sleeper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a sister i got worried and
took kyle in my arms and walked to my sister's room again.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The girls saw kyle in my arms and were mad
that i brought him there. I layed kyle on my sister's bed right beside
me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I told the girls everything and they
all
agreed that we should keep kyle beside us at all times.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>So we took the party into the living room.
And we forgotten that kyles bedroom is somewhat attached to the living
room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again i layed kyle down as he
continued to sleep. Finally it had reached midnight and this is were
the
trouble begins.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As soon as the clock had
stuck 12<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that being watched feeling was
present again. A cold chill stretched across the room.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And this time it wasnt just me. I looked at
my brother to check on him and again he was acting weird.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>So i told the girls and they were all like
'' Oh my god !! Whats up with ur bro''? He was twitching ,<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>shivering , turning blue/purple , he was iced
cold and was talking in his sleep.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Courtney my friend was terrified<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>i guess looking at my brother like that brought out her motherly
instinct
, and she wanted to hold him so i let her.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>And she did. Then we all felt a chill again. We were all cold.
Then me
and my friend Hannah was like feeling scared,<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>like from out of nowhere we got scared. I didnt know why but i
felt like
something was watching me and was going to hurt<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>me and my friends , i somehow knew<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>that we were all in GREAT danger.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While Courtney was holding kyle she<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>started acting weird.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She started
saying things like. '' I wanna die, I want my mom , Im scared, Let me
die''.
And she started crying very badly ,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>she
was basically crying her eyes out... And thats when i knew a ghost was
with us.
I knew the ghost was making her do this.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hannah immeditaley called her Witch<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>friend..... And she said to help protect us<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>we had to spit 3 times over ur right right
shoulder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And me , my sis, and hannah
did that. But courtney refused to.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
was crying and crying that she didnt want to , and she wasnt acting
like her
self .<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As if she was a totally diffrent
person. I was her best friend and i knew i just had to help.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I sat down next to courtney and told her that
if she wanted to be safe she had to do this.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She was crying and i wrapped her in a blanket with me to comfort
her.
Immediatley my eyes<span style="">&nbsp; </span>widen and they
changed color i completley blanked out. I couldnt see for a sec which
was
odd.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Except for the ghost... it was a
man and he was laughing as if he was a demon or satan.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I told the girls that he is making this
happen to us and he was laughing. If courtney didnt spit over<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>her shoulder we all can get killed. Finally
Courtney did. My eyes turned back to normal and everything<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>was back to normal. Kyle woke up and
immediately got up and without saying a word hugged ashley.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>After that i knew everything was gonna be ok.
Courtney stopped crying and hannah and i smiled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
continued with our slumber party and a few
hours later went to sleep. It was the strangest and best<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>sleepover ever. After that day , every
weekend we all agreed they would spend the night. It was truely a
strange night
for us all..but somehow im glad it happened. It made us all closer to
one another.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are truley Best friends.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

traveling to visit my parents
in south Texas, I stayed at an older hotel/Inn in town due to their
better
rates.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I'm a believer in you get what
you pay for, but the cheaper rate was just too good to pass up. After I
checked
in, I noticed the hotel clerk put me way in the back, with no one
around
me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I liked it that way, but then again
I didn't.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Let me start off by saying
that I MUST sleep with a cover.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Always
have, always will.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even in the summer, I
have to have a sheet to wrap myself with.<span style="">&nbsp;

got to the
room the A/C was kicking cold air like crazy.<span style="">&nbsp;

the A/C down, and got ready to go out with some old friends.<span

in boxers and a t-shirt, and covered myselft with the sheets and
comforter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At exactly 3 a.m., I woke up
freezing and noticed the blankets were taken off of me at a perfect
angle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I mean perfect.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is no way I kicked those covers
off.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No way!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
was freezing cold, but I was too lazy to
get up and turn the A/C even lower.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So,
I covered myself up and went back to sleep.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At exactly 4 a.m. I woke up again, and the covers were off of me
at the
exact same angle as before.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Perfectly
pulled back in an angle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As if someone
grabbed the corners and pulled them back.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I freaked out, and ended up sleeping with the light on until
morning
(even though the room had a light tint at night due to the parking lot
lights).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nothing happened again until
the night before I was to check-out (I stayed a total of 8 nights
there).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same thing happened again!<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I woke up and I was shivering.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My eyes were saucers, looking around the room
for something that wasn't there. For some reason, I was very calm.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I sat there in bed and asked if anyone was in
that room with me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Silence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I felt weird.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Not really scared.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Just
weird.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Like I was being watched, but by
more than one person.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I couldn't sleep
for the rest of the night, and just tossed and turned until morning.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>When I checked out, I asked the Hotel clerk
if anyone had ever told her about strange happenings in that room.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>She said no, never.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
asked if the maid would turn the A/C up for
me, and she said no.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If anything, she
told me they are instructed to put the A/C down to it's lowest level to
save on
the electric bill.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Why was my room
freezing cold all the time?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My father
came to my room once, and he commented on how cold it was.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Before I left town, I was telling this story
to a good friend, and she told me that someone had gotten shot at that
hotel
and died.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, she told me that
several people had died in that hotel through the years.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I had no idea.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was just too
weird.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I know it happened.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

 style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">I had an
experience with a female
ghost or spirit one time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It started
when i was in the backyard and i was just target shooting with my BB
gun, i was
out of ammo and decided to search for more lying on the ground. <span
 style="">&nbsp;</span>When i started looking more and more, went on
searching under a big,tall pine tree that is really old to say, when i
looked
up, i could see something in white, sorta like a pajama dress from
those older
days, but the suns gleam were blocking my view so i stood up, and there
what i
couldn't believe in sight was a crystal clear image of a little girl
about 11
years old, crouching on a branch about 30 feet high. I was startled to
see a
girl so high in the air that i didn't know she was a spirit, also the
way she
looked like a living person except in a faded skin. I then said "hey,
what
are you doing there", she didn't even bother to look or even move, like
she was ignoring me or was deaf. I then yelled but nothing seemed to
help. She
was looking straight ahead of her like she was so determined or
waiting. I then
went to go tell my mom. When i quickly brought my mom to the scene, she
was
completely vanished, like never there! My mom just said i was seeing
things and
i got furious, i knew she was there. About the next day it was raining
decent
but not that bad. I went to the same place and and at the same time. I
waited
and waited...i was deciding to give up until i looked over and there
she was
again! At the same time as yesterday at 7:29. I went back and yelled at
her
saying if she was ok but nothing shrugged her attention. I brought my
mom out
quickly and showed her the little girl ghost. She was there that time
and and
as noticeable as a bright color. But things never turned out as i
thought...My
mom never saw her...I kept yelling at my mom and clearly pointing where
she
still was but my mom said she couldnt see a thing. It was crazy but the
most
stangest thing that happened during that scene was the way the storm
reacted
with every time i said something about the ghost. The storm was raining
harder
and the wind was blowing like if hell was sruct loose!!! And if i
thought i
seen it all, i was in for something that i would remember that summer.
The way
the ghost disapeared was she just dived straight into the ground on the
other
side of my neighbors house!! It was like she killed her self plunging
straight
into the ground. When that ghost went away, the storm became calm and
not a
storm anymore. It was like one of those movies that end wierd in but in
a good
way. What really scared me was why i could only see it and not my
mother... But
that was not the only time i've seen a ghost...I started to see more
ghosts or
spirits at different places i never been to after i seen the ghost on
the
branch i called "The Ghost Of The Pine".<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Back in
the early 90's, a wealthy
family who lived in Corona owned 2 homes.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>One large home they owned was on the south side of Corona
overlooking
the 15 freeway.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The other home, used
later as an office, was in the old-town district on Corona's famous
Grand
Avenue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the story goes, before the
husband and wife met and got married, the husband lived in the large
house on
Grand Avenue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The house had once been a
funeral parlor and almost nightly, the husband would hear talking and
other
noise coming from the room next to him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He would check the room only to find it silent and nothing out
of place.
After he met his wife, they purchased the large house on the south side
and
turned the Grand Avenue mansion into an office.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>One of the children of this family went to my school, and he
claimed
that their family had experienced all kinds of strange phenomena in the
old
mansion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One instance, a soda can was
completely knocked off of a night stand right next to a bed that he was
sleeping on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And constantly, they would
hear footsteps upstairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The mother once
said she was in the bathroom and the door suddenly flew open (all of
the windows
were closed eliminating any chance of a draft).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Another night, the family drove past the mansion, as they often
would to
make sure it was secure-- remember, nobody lived there at this time. It
was
used only as an office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As they drove
past the house they noticed every single light in the house was turned
on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They went in, turned out the lights
and
left.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They checked with everyone who had
a key to the house,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and everyone assured
them they had not turned on the lights.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is claimed that the atmospheric pressure in the back yard is
different from the rest of the area.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These
stories were all interesting to me, but I still had some skepticism,
until...One year, the family was going to go on vacation to visit
relatives in
Texas, and they asked my mother and me if we would watch the mansion
for them
while they were gone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Keep in mind,
neither my mother nor I knew anything about the house, including the
strange
phenomena.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So Monday morning, we got to
the house and settled in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My mother, a
school teacher at the time, was grading some homework assignments and
I, only
about 5 at the time, was fast asleep on the couch.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My mother got thirsty, so she stacked the
homework assignments in a pile, went to the kitchen for some water,
came back
only to find the papers strewn all over the table and on the floor.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I was still fast asleep, and there were no
open windows.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later on that day, she was
in the kitchen again, and she heard (me) crying in the other room.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>She ran in to see what was wrong, but again,
I was fast asleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I did not appear to
be restless (as if crying in my sleep).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later
on that week, we would both occasionally hear footsteps walking around
upstairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is a very old house as you
can see from the attached photo, so naturally, the floors are very
creaky.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These were definitely solid
footsteps.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We constantly went upstairs
after hearing the
steps only to find the place empty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
the family returned from their vacation, my mother had mentioned to
them the
phenomena we experienced.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They laughed and
explained to us that it happens all of the time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
describe the entity as a friendly ghost
who likes to play pranks on people (hence the bathroom door flying
open).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The family eventually moved to
Texas and sold
the mansion to somebody else.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I never
returned to ask the new owners if they have experienced anything.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Perhaps somebody around this area might want
to.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

casino outside of Powhattan,
Kansas..known as the GOLDEN EAGLE CASINO...I use to gamble there a lot
especially to play bingo. There has been<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>a couple of times I remember that had me a bit scared. I was in
the
restroom on the north side of the bldg and as I was<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>about through using the porcelain throne..it
flushed by itself. I, at the time thought it was just a
malfunction..until
others told me that it happened to them and the faucets would turn on
w/out any
motion under them. Another time...I was cashing in some coins from a
machine
and I sat my purse upon the counter by the cashiers window. As I
awaited for
her to finish using the coin counter...I, all of a sudden felt cold and
just
for a split second..I felt I was gone..it is hard to explain..it was if
I was
dizzy and just as I was coming around my purse went flying off of the
counter
and across the floor. Being in awe over the incident..I looked at the
cashier
and bluntly asked..."WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?" She replied with a
smile..."They usually just bother the machines." I realized that an
apparition had passed through me and then proceeded to knock my purse
on to the
floor. Many have quit working there from being terrorized by these
apparitions
and have seen them and have been touched and a woman claimed to have
been raped
by one. They even had an Indian spirit guide woman do a ritual to get
rid of
the ghostly beings..but no luck! The stories are endless of this
place...beware
if you go gambling there!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

 style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">I have
been to Gibbs Bridge twice
and we have seen something everytime. The first time the signs kept
changing,
there would be a lot of writing on the signs or none everytime we came
around.
I looked back and thought that someone was messing around with us and I
saw a
figure standing along side of the road ran by the guard rail and
disappeared.
Then I kept seeing something black out of the corner of my eye. My
cousin was
with me and she started to scream and me and her both heard moaning
over her
screaming. Then it was me my sister and her friend, the signs again
kept
changing but only a few not all like last time. We took pictures and
got orbs.
Then we saw a figure again by the sign and disappered. We went all the
way down
the street and turned aroung and saw big bright light. I told my sister
it was
probably a car, so flash your lights to let them know that you are
coming she
did that and the light was gone. I kind of looked like a motorcycle
light with
handle bars. I know the whole story about it. Then we turned around
again and
saw it again. It was not the street light at all because we turned
around going
back to the bride about 10 to 15 times and only showed up about three
times.
The wierdest part of that night was we left and my sisters phone was in
the
center console nobody was touching it. Somebody that we know called us
and
wondered why we called, nobody did it was in the center console the
whole time.
My sister looked down and saw her phone hanging up and they said we
left a
message. it was alll three of us talking and and it was muffled. Tell
me what
you think and go out there some time agian.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Im 28
years old now. The paranormal
has always interested me, but only recently have I started to research
it. I
have come to believe, now, that some things I experienced as a child
were
probably more than nightmares.&nbsp; I believe my encouters were with
that of
the paranormal, edited with a touch of a childs imagination.&nbsp;
Contrary to
what you might believe, I think "my touch of a childs imagination" is
what scared me the most.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have decided to share with you
thoe
experiences that could be considered nightmares for your entertainment,
but
also those that I truly believe were paranormal. <br>
&nbsp;At the age of 5-7 ( I cant recall for sure). One night I was
lying in my
bed, asleep, I felt something moving at the bottom of my bed, and the
next
thing you know I felt like I was being dragged out of my bed. My covers
had
tightly wrapped themselves around my legs so tight that I couldnt move
my
legs.&nbsp; I yelled "my bed is eating me, help! Mommy Daddy My bed is
eating me.&nbsp; HELP!"&nbsp; by the time it stopped and parents got
into
the room, half my body was hanging off the side of my bed, while the
other half
was hanging on for dear life. You know what my parents' response
was..."That's what happens when you don't fix your bed every day! Your
bed
eats you!"&nbsp;&nbsp; No, really?&nbsp; I still never fixed my bed
after
that.&nbsp; I disproved that theory fast. It never happened again. <br>
I look back now and realize that what ever was in that house had a
weird and
somewaht morbid sense of humor. Check it out. <br>
&nbsp;Several other times I woudl wake up from a rather deep sleep,
turn over
and open my eyes, as if something told me "wake up Stef", sure enough
I would open my eyes and 1 of 2 things would be sleeping next to
me...a) Bo
Duke (he was like a hero to me at the time) or b) an orange mummified
witch
with a cone shaped hat and empty eye sockets.&nbsp; Now you would think
waking
up next to Bo Duke saying "Hi Stef" would be cool as all heck, but
no.&nbsp; I would freak out, jump so high I would fall off my bed
THUMP, and
run to moms room screaming "BO DUKE IS IN MY BED! HELP!".&nbsp; It
was way more dramatic when I saw the witch.&nbsp;<br>
Now here is what really makes me think it was actually a spirit playing
games
with me. As I got older, about 10 years old I would say.&nbsp; The
occurances
were NOT so graphical.&nbsp; I would still hear a voice say "Wake up
Stef" I would open my eyes and see a pitch black silohuette of a man
standing in the far corner of my room, about 6' tall. I would blink my
eyes a
few times; he was still there; I would pull the cover over my head and
then
peep out; HE WAS STILL THERE! Of course I then freaked out and and ran
to
mommys room screaming the BOOGIE MAN IS HERE TO GET ME!&nbsp; HELP
MOMMY! THE
BOOGIE MAN IS HERE!" This would happen several times a month for a good
year or so it seemed.&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;The last occurance was years later, when what believe to be the
same
silohuette mentioned above, ran across my room.&nbsp; First I saw a
blur run
down the wall to my left and stop in the middle of the wall near the
footboard
of my bed.&nbsp; It took a moment for it to take shape, but it was
definately
the silohuette of a human.&nbsp; I started to dart, and the moment I
moved, it
darted toward the other wall and vanished.&nbsp; I freaked out and flew
to my
dad and told him that there was someone in my room.&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;Years later when I was old enough to understand, my dad told me
of the
ghost of an old lady that dwelled in the house.&nbsp; She was a nice,
but
sometimes grumpy old gal.&nbsp; However, that doesnt explain the Man
that was
in my room.&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;I still cant figure out if the Bo Duke/Witch thing was truly a
nightmare,
or a spirit messign with my head using the "touch of a childs
imagination".&nbsp; <br>

carport and turned it into a large den.<span style="">&nbsp;

remained and

look
through the open window frame from the kitchen and see into the sunken
den or
visa versa.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The bedrooms were on a long
hallway at the back of the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
hallway could be reached by two doorways, the kitchen and living room
(actually
one big circle).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first bedroom on
the hall faced the street.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The bathroom
was next, another bedroom, and then my parent's bedroom at the end of
the
hall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The room next to my parent's room
was mine until my little sister was born (I was 5 years old).<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I was moved down to the first bedroom.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>This room gave me the creeps.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The closet door would slide open a bit on its
own (which my parents said was probably a draft from the heat or AC).<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>However, after someone broke into my bedroom
window while I slept and stole a few things from my room, I never
stayed in
there again...usually sneaking into my little sister's<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>room and sleeping with her or sleeping on my
parent's bedroom floor.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I constantly
slept with the bathroom light on and a bright night light or lamp.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I would wake up in the middle of the night
and hear odd noises that made me feel paralyzed and cold all over.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>One would think these irrational fears would
subside with age, but they seemed to intensify over the years.<span
 style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One recurring incident that still
bugs me
occurred in the kitchen/ den area.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Whenever I would be sitting on the couch watching t.v. I would
see the
silhouette of a person walk by the window frame from the old carport.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I would assume it was my Mom or Dad because
the shape was tall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What would scare me
to death was the fact that no one would appear at the door leading to
the steps
after I would see the shape walk by.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Many times I would call out to my parents thinking it was one of
them,
but no one would answer and then I would walk up the steps and look
into the
kitchen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was never anyone
there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Most times, this would happen
when I was home alone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On numerous
occasions my parents would come home to find me sitting on the front
porch
steps or sitting in my car with the doors locked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
went on for years, and I was very
excited when I moved out to go to college!<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Years later, I went to visit my little sister and stayed with
her in her
college dorm room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were telling ghost
stories with some of her friends when I told my accounts of the
"shadow".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was in mid
sentence when my sister finished my thought and described the incident
in
perfect detail!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had never told my
sister about this because she was much younger and I didn't want to
scare
her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>eedless to say, we were both
shocked and had goosebumps!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We compared
stories and it seems we had very similar experiences in that house.<span
 style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My parents eventually built a new
house
about 10 miles away and sold the house.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I wonder to this day if the new owners have ever experienced any
of the
oddities that my sister and I did.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

is our experience. Please read it all.<br>
This all happened between the times of 12:15 and 1:30 A.M.<br>
We just got back from Bloods Point Road and we are all pretty freaked
out. We
sat on the bridge for about half an hour and were in neutral. Nothing
happened
but two trucks kept passing by and trying to run us off the bridge.
They would
get close to the car, rev their engines, get really close, and then
suddenly
swerve. We ended up following one and it turned onto a phantom road,
its lights
disappeared, and it was gone. We went back to the bridge in the
opposite
direction, put the car in neutral, and waited. WE saw swerve marks and
two of
us went out to investigate and then suddenly a loud clear train whistle
sounded
and immediately following big rig lights lit up and it started coming
towards
us at high speed. The two ran back towards the car and got in, I turned
the car
around quickly and sped off. We turned off on a side road and waited
for the
big rig to pass. However it never passed and the lights were gone. On
the way
home, a cop truck was sitting on the side of the road waiting for us to
pass.
As we passed we noticed there was no driver and when we passed it, the
truck
sped off back towards Blood Point Road. Sadly we have no pictures
because the
camera died while we were on the bridge. All the electronics started
acting
oddly on the bridge. The GPS was turning on and off and told us we were
parked
side ways off the bridge when we were clearly on the bridge going the
right
way. Also the car became icy cold before the events even though I had
the heat
on high to defrost the windows. We are sorry if you dont believe but
1'oclock
is the magic time for us and we all believe what happened was real.
Seeing is
believing and we saw it and heard it. Experience it for yourself
because it is
a long story.<br style="">

 style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">I would
like to share an experience
me and a few friends incounterd last year on Christmas night. We were
on our
way to Texas just driving killing time being typical teenagers, when a
friend
of<span style="">&nbsp; </span>mine said "I have some friends
in Texas, lets go see what they are up to". So off we went into Texas
when
we finally arived to his friends house they were loading up in the car,
so we
asked where they were going they simply replyd "BROWSPRINGS". We aren't
from around that area, so I wasn't sure what to expect...! So we
finally arrive
and one thing i might add is my friend who just graduated had got a new
car, so
we pull up, by this time it is about 12:30 or so she is driving im in
the
passenger side seat by boyfriend and his bestfriend are in the backseat
everyone get out but me, I can't open my door, all the doors are
unlocked, like
i said this car is brand new right off the laught! So I ask her to
unlock it
with the keychain so she unlocks, I'm still not able to get out! So i
crawl in
the back and get out through the backseat by now I'm already kinda
creeped out!
We get out and we are walking around we walk to see the spring when we
see
something solid white not sure of what it is, I stand back and let them
find
out. They walk over and find a solid white horse all cut in pieces, no
blood
stains or anything just in about ten or twenty pieces, So they look
around to
see if their is any one around and all they find is a bloody knife by
the shore
to the spring. We get in the car and leave as fast as we can. We decide
to go
back a few weeks later in day time, thought maybe we might have a
better look
at the place. When we arrive we get out and walk around when we notice
all
these tiny pieces of paper all over the ground. We start to look around
and
pick up these paper pieces, we try and put them together somewhat like
a puzzle.
We didn't find all the pieces but what we did find was disturbing. It
was a
suicide letter. This lady was talking to her husband who had been
locked up for
life. As soon as we read it we got out of there as soon as possible! We
havn't
been back since. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span
 style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">I have
told my story to a few but
not many. I have also heard that BrownSprings is an Idnian burial
ground. I'm
not sure what the place is but one thing i'm sure of is there is
paronormal out
there!!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

early morning I had been sitting
in my family room, reading the newspaper. It was a very quiet morning
and I was
all alone. The sun was coming threw a bedroom window off the family
room, and
shining down the hallway. It was one of those extremely bright sun
rises. The
kind where you see dust particles floating threw the air. I glanced up
as I was
turning the newspaper page. I then saw in the sun rays, the outline of
what
looked like a man. It had a light black to grey color. It had no
details, just
the outline of its body. It was about 3ft off the floor, and had no
legs from
around the knees down. I could see the arms. It had no hands either. I
just
remember telling myself, wow its a ghost, take it all in. I told myself
to not
turn my head or blink. The ghost appeared to be looking into the
bedroom. It
turned its head slightly to the right. At that point I had to blink, my
eyes
were drying out. When I did that it was gone. I then got up and put my
hands
threw the spot where it was. I guess I wanted to see if it would be
cooler or
something but it was the same temp. I just stood there in amazement of
how cool
that was. I also need to ad, it was no ones shadow, and its hard to
describe
but it was not a shadow, I could see the dust particles going threw the
figure,
and the figure was in the middle of the hallway. It was three
dimensional. It
actually looked like a hologram. I really love those rare ghost
encounters.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

attending ultrasound school. About three years prior to this my foster
mother
had been diagnosed with ovarian cancer. This is a cancer that has a
very poor
prognosis. Although, she had went into remission she later had a
reoccurrence
in which the cancer had spread throughout her body. Well to make a long
story
short I was very broke in school an did not have a phone, and I had not
spoken
with them in a couple of months. I attend school in the evenings, and
was up
studying late frequently, and<span style="">&nbsp; </span>on a
random night at about one in the morning I felt a need to stop what I
was doing
and write two different poems telling her I knew I had to let her
go.The next
day I came an there was a note on the door from the sheriffs
department. Before
I even looked at it I knew my foster mother had died. After speaking
with my
foster father he told she died the night before around one am. This may
not be
a ghost story, but yet it was an extraordinary experience that no one
could
ever convince me coincidence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

one of these dangerously cold
nights. My kids fell asleep in their room with the TV on. I woke around
2 am,
and the TV was so loud in their room, but I was so relaxed and warm
under my
blankets I just did not want to get up and turn it off. I tried to fall
back
asleep, but the TV was just so annoying I could not ignore it. But I
still
could not bear getting up and turning it off. I tossed and turned, and
all I
could think was that dam TV. Then all of a sudden it shut off. My head
lifted
up, and I thought what the heck? now I jumped up, went in their room
and turned
on their light. They were fast asleep. My kids and I were the only
people home,
and they didn't shut it off, so who did? I even checked the next day,
to see if
it had been on a sleep timer, but to set it, you had to do all this
screwing
around to set it. I know my kids were not capable of even accidently
setting
it. I felt like someone, was trying to do me a favor that night.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: &quot;Verdana&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Hi
my name is David, I am a French student and I wanted to share some
eerie things that happened to me and to some of my friends with you
readers.<br>
What happened to me:<br>
My grandfather died last year. He was a total atheist and believed that
supernatural was just some bullshit and that people who got interested
in it
were pitiful fools. What's more, he was a convinced internationalist
communist
and often led some speeches against God and the Church. I was the
contrary of
my grandfather: a conservative christian loving God and Fatherland so
this
situation often led to arguments between my grandfather and me, as we
were
obviously on a different wavelength. But it didn't matter. He was my
grandfather, I was his grandson, he loved me and I loved him as well
and we
would often laugh together. Well, as a Christian believer I believed
(and still
believe) in hell and I feared that my grandfather would go there after
his
death because of his resolute anti-God feelings so I said a lot of
Rosaries so
that God would put him on the right way.<br>
One day, as I went back from the university I got a phonecall from my
mother.
She told me that my grandfather had been sent to the hospital in order
to cure
a little pain on the knee but when the doctors started to inspect his
general
state of health, they found out that my grandfather had a generalized
cancer
and that is why he felt so tired. I got so upset hearing that, that I
rushed to
the church and put a candle to the Holy Virgin so that She would get
the
forgiveness to my Godless, communist grandfather. I went to visit my
grandfather in the hospital where he was sadly ending his life and I
could
notice no changes in his mind and moral. And his calvary in the
hospital bed
lasted for months. Here is the moment when my story becomes
interesting. In my
prayers, I would always ask the Holy Virgin to save him and let me now
by a
sign that she had taken him to the right place, near to Gad and far
from hell.<br>
It was an ordinary night. I was reading in my bed with my bedlight and
listening to the outside noises as usual, and I closed my eyes to sleep
afterwards. Oh God, I can never forget what I lived this night ! It was
about 5am,
because it happened just a moment before I woke up. I had a very
powerful dream
and it looked so real that it is still sculpted in my memory. I dreamt
about a
giant curtain of red velvet with a portrait of my grandfather hanging
on it. I
looked at this picture and my eyes looked leftwards and saw that the
curtains
were open like on a theatre. Behind these velvet curtains I could see
the sky
filled with orange clouds lit like on a wonderful sunset, or dawn I
don't know.
And suddenly, I saw a boy kneeling in the darkness in front of this
scene. And
I recognized myself. I can't figure out why but I know that the boy in
this
dream kneeling was me in person. A short moment after, a young woman
went out
from behind the curtain, from the lit side. She had a blue dress and a
blue
veil, both were blue, one dark, the other clear. She looked like
Raphael's Holy
Virgin in the painting. I remember her peaceful face that made me feel
peaceful
and tranquil. The lady sat in front of the kneeling boy (me) and
started talking
to him. I would see the lady's lips moving but no sounds coming from
her mouth.
And I remember her beautiful eyebrows that reminded me those of an
oriental
princess. After talking, she showed me something behind her. It was a
ladder. A
beautiful multicolour ladder that went in the orange clouds. The ladder
went
through a hole in the clouds and this hole had an ncredibly powerful
light
coming right from it and it throwed rays of lights and was noisy like a
storm,
though not frightening at all, at the contrary. My dream stopped with
this
vision of delight.&nbsp; <br>
I had forgotten the dream on the following morning and went downstairs
for the
coffee. My mother was standing in the kitchen and her eyes were
painful. As I
held my cup, she told me that my sister called from the hospital and
that my
grandfather passed away. I was waiting for this event with pain, but I
got
psychologically ready. Anyway, tears began to go out from my eyes and I
began
to cry and go in the garden to think. And as I was walking through the
trees of
my garden, I suddenly remembered that strange dream of the night. And I
was
thinking that it was the sign I was waiting for and that I beseeched
the
blessed Virgin to send me. I was so grateful, I went to the church and
told the
Holy virgin Thank you, but I wasn't expecting such an intervention !
But
another prayer of mine had been made. After the funeral (I couldn't
attend it
as I was having an examination at the university at that time), I asked
my
grandmother how it was like. The answer let me voiceless. My
grandfather had
returned to God before he died, because my grandmother asked him how he
wanted
his funeral to be...and he said that there would be a mass at the
church and
the coffin would stand in the church. It was his last will, him who
lived as an
atheist communist all his life.There I want to tell you guys, trust God
and ask
him a lot, for he listens and have mercy for all of us.<br>
What happened to my friend:<br>
I got a good friend named Gennie who is a catholic christian
worshipper, just
like me, and her son has lived supernatural experiences as he was a
little boy.
It began a day when he started to tell things to his grandfather about
his
deceased grandmother. The grandfather got impressed and told Gennie
that his
little grandson was freaking him out because he knew things that he
couldn't
normally know, as the grandfather had never talked about it to anybody,
not
even to Gennie. One day, Gennie could know that her son had visions of
his
deceased great grandmother. He was only three years old. On an early
morning,
Gennie, as usual, went to get him out of his bed to go to school and
she
discovered her son behaving different. He wasn't grumpy and tired as
usual but
smiling with an incredible expression of joy in his eyes.<br>
"I saw granny ! I saw granny !"<br>
Gennie asked him "when, how". And the little one suddenly showed the
ceiling with his finger. Gennie looked up but of course, saw nothing.
She
looked back at her son and asked how is granny. Her son showed the
ceiling
again and said "But she is there above on the white cloud ! She is
smiling
! Can't you see her ?!!"<br>
Gennie looked up again but she definitely saw nothing but the dark
ceiling. She
questionned her son again. "Has granny told you something ?" and the
little boy answered "Ya, she gave me a flower and she told me to care
about it all the days of my life". Gennie afterwards noted these words
on
a paper. But how could such a little guy invent such stories ? It let
me
charmed anyway. The other world may not be so hidden and cares about us.<br>
Don't hesitate to write to me if you want to,guys,I love to share my
experiences.<br style="">
