<P>
<P><B>  Hi I just came on the internet to check my mail when I found this
it reminded me of a very strange thing that I want to tell you about I hope
very much that this will be printed . These true events happened in Hull
Massachusetts on Nantasket beach . I had heard stories about the same house
from 3 different people , a past owners son , my uncle by marriges uncle
from my mothers side of the family and my cousin on my fathers side of the
families  cousin. I first had been talking to Mike a kid from school who's
mothers house was haunted . She lived there for thirteen years and had witnessed
all sorts of strange events. One was that a party would happen every December
30 in her bedroom and every night at 8:33 like clockwork she'd see a "policeman"
climb the stairs and once he got to the eight stair he'd stop and disapear.
Then he went on about how a rose  bush had been unfront of the house and
was overgrowing the deck so his step-great grand father cut it down , only
to have it regrow this happened twice more over the next thirteen years until
they finally just let it grow. The plant had been in full bloom when the
family moved , they had a picture to prove that but when they went back the
next day to take a part of the flower the plant was completely shriveled
upnow if you think this isn't strange lilacs grew in its place and the same
thing happened when the next people moved. Now I didn't think very much of
the stories at first , until I met Ben. Ben was my first cousins cousin (
no relation to me ) who was at a family party over my cousins house he didn't
talk to me at first but to his first cousin about a haunted house that was
near him and described it and gave the adress on Nantasket Ave. a long street
with many houses and I got premission only to use the street name and not
the whole adress. I asked him questions about it since he had first hand
experience and he told me all about it ,and oviously he didn't know Mike.
He told me that his parents had looked at it to move in and the windows had
blown out from the inside for know aparent reason. Now I started to beleive
Mike more. I then met my uncle by blood's uncle ( also no relation to me
) who had been a policeman in Hull and worked for a policeman named Hank
who had lived in that house and who had drown lobster fishing . I then told
him about my Mike and Bens stories and he was practicaly shocked  I called
Mike and that was when I could first experience to go into the house and
see for my self this house of horrors because the house was being sold and
Mikes mother acted as someone thinking about buying it even though she really
had no intent of doing so. It was like I had expected it had kind of a
&lt;I&gt;feel&lt;/I&gt; to it  so I stepped into the house and said his name
, "Hank" I knew I'd get a response but I now regreted saying his name out
loud . I then heard a loud crash and a scream we went into the room and found
a broken mirror about four feet from the dresser  was glass that was perfectly
out in the mirror shape and the wooden part had no glass in it now.  It was
an impossible thing to happen and th realEsate agent was horrified. </B>
<P><B>I cfan't blame her so was I. Well I hope you enjoyed this true writing
from me and if anyone else knows anything about this then they should tell
it. </B>

<H3><A NAME=normal>It Looks Like a Normal House</A>
</H3><P><B>by titania@gte.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>My grandparents bought our house about fifty years ago, they have
since</B>
<P><B>passed away, but our ghosts remain. In our sewing room there is the
ghost</B>
<P><B>of a woman who paces and cries. We think she was murdered in there,
mostly</B>
<P><B>because at times you feel as if a pillow is being held over your face.
It</B>
<P><B>is nearly impossible to breath, I have stumbled out of that room more
than</B>
<P><B>once, nearly fainting from lack of oxygen. This one in particular does
not</B>
<P><B>seem to affect men, only women above the age of 15 years. In the
hallway,</B>
<P><B>there are two ghosts. One of a large man with heavy boots. This one</B>
<P><B>terrified my sister and I when we were children. At night he will chase
you</B>
<P><B>down the hall into the living room, he never passes the the hall door,
but</B>
<P><B>gets to the thresh hold and stops. (After my divorce, I moved back
home,</B>
<P><B>and notice that mychildren do the same thing. They have never been
told the</B>
<P><B>old ghost stories.) The other is my grandmother's dog that has been
dead</B>
<P><B>for for nearly forty-five years. This is the "day shift". I hear her
nails</B>
<P><B>clicking down the hall every so often, and sometimes she goes tearing
down</B>
<P><B>the hall, and as she turns the corner, you hear a slide and thump.
(She</B>
<P><B>always smacked into the wall when running at full tilt.) The front
bedroom</B>
<P><B>harbors something that looks like a nun, although it doesn't "feel"
like a</B>
<P><B>nun. It is rather menacing, but definetly female. The garage was
converted</B>
<P><B>into another bedroom many years ago. In there you can find a little
boy</B>
<P><B>sitting on the floor in front of the door, a little girl who shakes
the bed</B>
<P><B>just to wake you up, and in the closet I'm not sure who he is but
he's</B>
<P><B>really noisy! There are others, but these are the most prominent of
all.</B>

<H3><A NAME=aunt>My Aunt and Uncle's House</A>
</H3><P><B>by stewart1222@enter.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>It started in 1995 when my aunt, uncle, and cousins bought a new house.
</B>
<P><B>The main part of the house was built in 1839 and an addition was put
on in </B>
<P><B>1878(the years might be off a little).  As soon as they bought the
house </B>
<P><B>and were pretty much moved in, my family went over to visit.  The house
</B>
<P><B>was fine, really pretty, but when we got up to the third floor, I
couldn't</B>
<P><B>breath and I got a bad headache. I had to go back down right away.
 A </B>
<P><B>couple of days later, we went back to help clean(the people before
had </B>
<P><B>left the house disgusting).  I brought a friend with me this time,
and she</B>
<P><B>was the first to see something.  I went in to get a drink and when
I came</B>
<P><B>back outside, she was sitting in a chair, very still.  When I came
over to</B>
<P><B>her, she said "Look down by the pool".  I did and I didn't see anything.
</B>
<P><B>She was trying to tell me that she saw a little girl, but before she
could </B>
<P><B>descibe her we heard a loud bang that came from the basement doors
behind </B>
<P><B>us.  We thought that my little brother and cousin had gotten into </B>
<P><B>something, but when we opened the doors, it was dark and no one was
down </B>
<P><B>there.  That's when I got the same feeling from the third floor, I
</B>
<P><B>couldn't breath and I had a bad headache.  We ran out, shut the doors
and </B>
<P><B>ran down to the pool where we found my little brother and cousin
swimming.</B>
<P><B>Later that night when we were saying good-bye to everyone, I was hugging
</B>
<P><B>my aunt and facing this little shed we planned to turn into a
playhouse(I</B>
<P><B>was 12) and I saw a black man in a blue shirt and white pants walk
behind </B>
<P><B>and never come out.  I got all panicking and got in the car and wouldn't
</B>
<P><B>come out.  Everyone wanted to know what was wrong and when I told them
</B>
<P><B>there was a man back there they tried to assure me nobody was there,
but I </B>
<P><B>swear I saw him.  A couple of weeks later I was invited to sleep over.
 I </B>
<P><B>pushed the man out of my thoughts and accepted.  Everything went fine
and </B>
<P><B>bedtime came around and I was put on the floor at the foot of my cousins
</B>
<P><B>bed.  I fell right to sleep, but it didn't last long.  I woke up around
</B>
<P><B>1:30 with a terrible stomaach ache.  I tried to go back to sleep but
when </B>
<P><B>I put my head on my pillow I heard this moaning.  It wasn't one person,or
</B>
<P><B>moaner, it was a couple, all different volumes and pitches.  I finally
</B>
<P><B>fell back to sleep but again, it didn't last long.  I woke up again
at </B>
<P><B>three and looked out the window from where I was laying.  I saw this
big </B>
<P><B>tree and 1 star through the branches but something wasn't right.  I
</B>
<P><B>realized the light was on, and it wasn't the last time I woke up. 
Maybe I </B>
<P><B>didn't notice, but I remeber not being able to see the tree.  My confused
</B>
<P><B>thoughts were interuppted by a white cloud that flew right through
the </B>
<P><B>tree.  I don't mean it weaved itself in and out, I mean it went right
</B>
<P><B>through.  I got up and left that room and went into my other cousins,
</B>
<P><B>where my brother was asleep.  I woke him up and explained everything
to </B>
<P><B>him.  Then I fell asleep and slept the rest of the night.  Other things
</B>
<P><B>have happended, too.  One night, in the summer of 1996, I woke to look
out </B>
<P><B>the window and see a little girl staring up at me.  She was cute and
she </B>
<P><B>resembled the girl that my friend explained to me.  There was a sadness
</B>
<P><B>with this girl, and I wanted to cry, or run out of the house and take
her </B>
<P><B>in my arms and tell her everything will be all right.  I new it wouldn't
</B>
<P><B>so I left the little girl staring up at me, and went back to sleep.
</B>
<P><B>Another time I was running around the corner of the house in broad
</B>
<P><B>daylight and saw the little girl peering around the doorway of the
barn, </B>
<P><B>looking at me, this time without the darkening sadness, but kind of
a </B>
<P><B>playful look.  I turned and ran the other way.  Another time, me, my
</B>
<P><B>brother, and my three cousins were up in the third floor and we were
</B>
<P><B>playing with this doll that walks around in a walker and cries and
laughs, </B>
<P><B>we were making fun of it and beating over the head with a cardboard
brick.</B>
<P><B>When we were done we turned off the doll &amp; walker and the remote
and we </B>
<P><B>sat down and started playing with a Ouja board.  Me, my brother and
cousin</B>
<P><B>put our hands on the pointer. My cousin started saying "Spirits of
the </B>
<P><B>light, protect us from the Spirits of the dark" but the doll started
</B>
<P><B>laughing.  We screamed and raced downstairs, leaving my oldest cousin
who </B>
<P><B>had fell to take care of herself.  Also, my cousin and sister have
seen </B>
<P><B>the little girl on the basement stairs and just disapear into thin
air. My </B>
<P><B>cousin also saw her when we were playing Man Hunt.  She was running
and </B>
<P><B>hiding behind trees, like she was playing with us.  I haven't seen
</B>
<P><B>anything since the summer, and I also haven't been there too much.
 I hope </B>
<P><B>I will get to see the little girl some more.  If any people would like
to </B>
<P><B>email me with questions or helpful info, feel free to.    </B>

<H3><A NAME=pipe>The Pipe Cleaner</A>
</H3><P><B>by Nanoboy@bigfoot.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>My father told us this story when we were small...I'm not sure if it
is</B>
<P><B>true, but he says it is.</B>
<P>
<P><B>	We had and old farm-house, in fact it was the oldest one on the road.
</B>
<P><B>In 1974 my mother was in the hospital after just having my sister and
my</B>
<P><B>Dad had sent me to stay with relatives.  He had closed off most of
the</B>
<P><B>house with blankets in the doorways and was just heating the one room.
</B>
<P><B>He was sitting there reading the newspaper and he heard a noise.  He</B>
<P><B>listened to make sure it wasn't a tree limb or a mouse in the wall
or</B>
<P><B>something like that.  The noise was different and it had a</B>
<P><B>pattern....tickety-tick, tickety-tick.  He turned the light on
 upstairs</B>
<P><B>and went to investigate.  The noise stopped. He dismissed it and</B>
<P><B>returned to his paper.  He had no sooner sat down and he heard it</B>
<P><B>again.  He waited and it didn't stop so he went to look again.  As
soon</B>
<P><B>as he turned the light on it stopped.  Confused, he went back to his</B>
<P><B>paper and sure enouh it started again.  This time he snuck up the
stairs</B>
<P><B>in the dark.  He could clearly hear the tickety-tick, tickety-tick.
 He</B>
<P><B>couldn't see anyone though.  He said, "Who's there?", and  there was
a</B>
<P><B>flash of red light and the noise stopped.</B>
<P>
<P><B>	Ten year's later my father woke up in the middle of the night to see
a</B>
<P><B>man dressed in clothes from the 1800's with one leg up on the end of
the</B>
<P><B>bed.  The man was just staring at him while cleaning his pipe.  The
only</B>
<P><B>sound my dad could here was the noise he made while scraping his pipe</B>
<P><B>out, clickety-click, clickety-click!  </B>
<P><B>	The funny thing was is my Dad thought the person was real.  He
yelled</B>
<P><B>at him, "Who the hell are you?".  There was a red flash and the
figure</B>
<P><B>disappeared.  My Dad yelling had awoken my mother.  He told her what
he</B>
<P><B>saw but she told him he he was dreaming and to go back to sleep.  To</B>
<P><B>this day he swears he wasn't asleep when he saw the man.  He didn't
even</B>
<P><B>remember his experiences from ten years before until a couple days</B>
<P><B>later.  He's sure the man cleaning his pipe was the exact same sound
he</B>
<P><B>heard all those years before.  Nobody ever saw anything else to</B>
<P><B>substantiate my Dad's story and we no longer live in the house.</B>

<H3><A NAME=christmas>Christmas Ornament</A>
</H3><P><B>by FJPOST@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>I have a white linen bell. It is a Christmas tree ornament that my
grandmother made shortly before she died.  My grandmother was from Lithuania
and is the only grandparent that I can remember very well. The others - also
from Lithuania - died when I was very young.  My grandmother knew she was
dying from colon cancer that summer, so she began making crafts, thing to
give to her children and grandchildren with which to be remembered.  The
bell of one of these.</B>
<P><B>     It is intricate, linen lace, fashioned with white sparkles.  Each
year, I pull it out from its box and put t on the tree.  This year, I decided
not to pack it away, and have it in a dresser drawer in my bedroom where
I can look at t.</B>
<P><B>     Just after my grandmother died, my sister got pregnant with my
niece.  Her daughter is now a young adult.  She's like many of the kids that
I now teach.  She also has a linen bell, fashioned by an old woman who she
never knew.  It's interesting, last summer my sister told me that shortly
after her daughter was  born - as a toddler - the little girl saw an older
woman in her room.  She wasn't frightened of this woman, but was indeed curious
to her identity.  The woman smiled lovingly at her.  Only three, the child
described the woman to her mother as having spoken "funny English." Her
description matched the picture of my grandmother that now sits on a desk
in my sister's family room.</B>
<P><B>     Some say that it could be bad that my grandmother came back from
 where she is to see her great-granddaughter.  I don't think so. I think
it's a blessing.</B>

<H3><A NAME=protective>A Protective Spirit</A>
</H3><P><B>by SKoches@TacoBell.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>About 1931,  my mother had a "visitation".  The folks were living in</B>
<P><B>company housing (a bedroom and a kitchen, outside plumbing) at a coal</B>
<P><B>mine in Illinois with one heating source - a pot bellied stove in the</B>
<P><B>kitchen.  It was January, and bitterly cold.  At the time my sister
was</B>
<P><B>about 5 months old.  As usual, the fire in the stove was banked to
give</B>
<P><B>off enough heat to keep my sister warm in her crib by the stove.  At</B>
<P><B>about 1am my mother felt someone tapping her on the shoulder.  She
was</B>
<P><B>facing the kitchen when she opened her eyes to see a woman dressed
in a</B>
<P><B>long black gown with mutton sleeves and lace at her neck and cuffs.
 The</B>
<P><B>lady's hair was pulled up in a Gibson style and she was standing
above</B>
<P><B>my sister's crib looking at the baby.  Mother turned over to my
father</B>
<P><B>and whispered "Joseph!"  </B>
<P>
<P><B>Upon turning back to the kitchen, the woman was gone.  Mother got up
to</B>
<P><B>check on my sister and found that the stove had gone out and the
diaper</B>
<P><B>my sister wore was ice cold (from doing what babies do best - wet).
 The</B>
<P><B>temperature was dropping and had my mother continued to sleep, the
baby</B>
<P><B>would have frozen.  When she described the woman to my father, he
went</B>
<P><B>to his childhood bible and removed a small photograph of his mother
that</B>
<P><B>he had stashed away.  She was dressed in a long black gown with lace
at</B>
<P><B>her neck and wrists, smiling for the camera.  Dad said that she was</B>
<P><B>buried in that dress about a year after the picture was taken.
 (Grandma</B>
<P><B>had died of a botched abortion.)  </B>
<P>
<P><B>Mom always had "feelings" and "forebodings" and as kids, we learned
to</B>
<P><B>listen to her and take these things into account.  She would even
tell</B>
<P><B>my dad not to take a job on the railroad extra board because she felt</B>
<P><B>something would happen to that run.  She wasn't always correct, but</B>
<P><B>often enough for us to take note!</B>

<H3><A NAME=not>Haunted or Not?</A>
</H3><P><B>by Ragnell513@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>From 1980 until 1983, my husband and I rented an old farmhouse from
a very nice couple with a family.  It was known as a grandparent's or in-law's
house.  The original structure was a log cabin, and it had been added onto
sometime in the late 1800's, which made it very close to the "main" house.
 It was a charming old house, but I always felt really uneasy there.  My
oldest daughter was just a baby at the time, and my husband was working a
lot of evenings.  I always had the feeling that someone was watching me,
but never really saw anything.  I did hear mice, I think, because there were
always scurrying, scratching noises in the walls and ceilings, but never
saw any.  I really got concerned one night, though--my husband was working
late.  I was in the upstairs bathroom getting ready for bed.  The upstairs
bathroom had a window that looked down on the backdoor and patio.  I know
I was wide awake and not imagining things when I distinctly heard a voice
say my name.  I thought my husband was locked out as he always came in the
back door, so I quick looked out of the window to see if he was down there,
and there was no one there.  My daughter was sleeping, and the voice was
definitely a male voice.  I never was so scared in my life!  I didn't sleep
well in that house, but don't remember any particularly horrible nightmares--just
that uneasy feeling.  But, in all the time we lived in that house, twice
someone spoke my name and no one there.</B>

<H3><A NAME=feeling>Ghostly Sounds and Feeling</A>
</H3><P><B>by KAC75@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>I am very interested in ghosts and hauntings, though I do not know
very much</B>
<P><B>about them but what I've heard from others or read in other stories
or websites.  I</B>
<P><B>live in Southeastern Pennsylvania, and I was just wondering if you
know of</B>
<P><B>any especially notable haunted places in my area.  I have heard and
read many</B>
<P><B>stories about the Berks County area, which is only about a half hour
from</B>
<P><B>where I live.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>To my knowledge, I have never actually seen a ghost, but I am convinced
that</B>
<P><B>I have at least heard some and felt the presence of others.  One time,
I had</B>
<P><B>gone with my boyfriend (now my husband)  to visit a friend in Boyertown,
PA</B>
<P><B>about a year and a half ago.  When we entered the building where his</B>
<P><B>apartment was in, I got a very strange, creepy feeling.  I didn't know
why,</B>
<P><B>but I did know I wanted to get out of there FAST!  I cannot say that
I felt</B>
<P><B>like I was in danger, but it was a very unsettling and uncomfortable
feeling.</B>
<P><B> The next time we went to see Randy (my husband's friend) I decided
I'd wait</B>
<P><B>in the car for them.  It was at this time that I first saw a plaque
on the</B>
<P><B>front wall of the building.  It stated that it was the former site
of the</B>
<P><B>Rhoads Opera House, in which there had been a fire in 1908.  The fire
had</B>
<P><B>killed 170 people who had been packed (and terribly overcrowded) into
the</B>
<P><B>Opera House to see a Sunday School play.  The building was rebuilt
soon after</B>
<P><B>the fire.  I had read the story of the fire about two years before
this</B>
<P><B>visit, in a book called "Ghost Stories of Berks County" by Charles
J. Adams</B>
<P><B>III.  Needless to say, I never did go into the building again.</B>
<P>
<P><B>A few years ago, before I met my husband, I was living in an apartment
in a</B>
<P><B>very old building in Royersford, PA (the town where I've lived for
most of my</B>
<P><B>life).  I had moved into this place in November.  When we were moving
my</B>
<P><B>things in, I went down into the basement for the first - and last -
time.  I</B>
<P><B>got the same creepy feeling down there that I described above.  I
quickly</B>
<P><B>decided not to store any of my things downstairs, so I wouldn't have
the need</B>
<P><B>to go down there ever again.  Now, by the following spring, the woman
in the</B>
<P><B>apartment next to mine had moved away, and I was the only tenant left
in the building.  There was a larger apartment upstairs that the landlord
couldn't rent until he fixed</B>
<P><B>various problems with it.  However, almost every night, I was kept
awake by</B>
<P><B>the sounds of someone walking around upstairs!  I almost jumped right
out of</B>
<P><B>my skin one night when I heard these footsteps walk across the floor
above</B>
<P><B>me, come down the inside stairs, proceed down the hallway and stop
outside my</B>
<P><B>bedroom door!  The inside stairs were in my living room closet.  When
the</B>
<P><B>building had been remodeled to create apartments in the old house,
it had</B>
<P><B>been done in such a way that if you were to open the closet door in
my living</B>
<P><B>room and try to go up the stairs, you would hit your head on the bottom
of</B>
<P><B>the upstairs floor, with NO POSSIBLE WAY TO GO ANY FURTHER)  After
several</B>
<P><B>weeks of such performances, a friend and I went up to the outside door
of the</B>
<P><B>2nd floor apartment and discovered that it was locked with a padlock
that had</B>
<P><B>obviously not been unlocked for quite a long time.  (My landlord was
not</B>
<P><B>disposed to doing many repairs in my building.)  And also, the wooden
floor</B>
<P><B>of the porch upstairs was in such horrible condition that we very nearly
fell</B>
<P><B>through it onto the concrete below, not to mention that we made a great
deal</B>
<P><B>of noise walking on the squeaky porch.  In all the times I had heard
someone</B>
<P><B>upstairs, I had never heard anyone going up or down the outside steps.
 A few</B>
<P><B>weeks before I moved out the landlord finally decided to start working
on the</B>
<P><B>upstairs apartment, and after he removed the padlock and was in there
more</B>
<P><B>often, I didn't hear anything else at night.  Pretty odd, don't you
think?</B>

kind-of</B>
<P><B>across the street, and to our right... there was a vacant field across
the</B>
<P><B>street from us...</B>
<P>
<P><B>The lights were on in the Cox's residence... so we knew someone was</B>
<P><B>home... which was not always the case.  Mr. Cox worked as a pilot for</B>
<P><B>the Naval Air station... or something like that... my dad also worked
at</B>
<P><B>the navel base, too... but that night some one was home at the Cox's</B>
<P><B>residence.</B>
<P>
<P><B>There were other children, many our age... some younger, and in</B>
<P><B>groups, and some older... most with costumes of goblins, and ghosts,</B>
<P><B>and other costumes that were appropriate for that special night.  So</B>
<P><B>we made one stop, next door, then headed across the street to the</B>
<P><B>Cox's residence and knocked.  We waited but there was no answer..</B>
<P><B>so Elizabeth and I peered throught the front door glass, and inside
the</B>
<P><B>small frame house, Mr. Cox was sitting in an overstuffed cloth
chair..</B>
<P><B>the old brownish kind... that looked that it may have been stuffed
with</B>
<P><B>cotton...</B>
<P>
<P><B>He was in full naval uniform, even with his cap on... we could see</B>
<P><B>him clearly in the room... the floor lamp was lit, and the reflection</B>
<P><B>around the room from the wallpaper covered wooden walls, gave</B>
<P><B>a good view... The chair faced a little to the right of the door, so</B>
<P><B>he was not looking exactly at us, but a little to the right of us...
and</B>
<P><B>he simply sat and stared at the right side of the front door where</B>
<P><B>we stood.... knocking.  He didn't even seem to hear our knock.</B>
<P>
<P><B>It was obvious that he did not intend to get up and give a treat so</B>
<P><B>Elizabeth and I really pounded on the door, to irritate him into a</B>
<P><B>candy... we were children,  and we new the power of the irritation</B>
<P><B>factor.</B>
<P>
<P><B>But still, he didn't budge... so we left, exiting on the left side
of the</B>
<P><B>wooden front steps... the steps had two sides...  a person could</B>
<P><B>enter from the right or left... and as we exited,  I took a bar of
soap</B>
<P><B>that I used in an emergency, and left a quick design on the window</B>
<P><B>screen that was on the left side of his door... and we quickly left
for</B>
<P><B>better pickings at some other residence....</B>
<P>
<P><B>We were happy that night, and soon forgot Mr. Cox's rudeness at</B>
<P><B>not accomodating us... and it wasn't until the next day that my
mother</B>
<P><B>had informed Elizabeth and I that Mr. Cox had been killed in a
aviation</B>
<P><B>accident, about dark... the time that we saw him....  Elizabeth and</B>
<P><B>I were really excited... and we told mother that we had seen him
sitting</B>
<P><B>in his chair... but mother, who, never took anything serious that we
said</B>
<P><B>or did... so after a few days... the event was forgotten... until now....
 I</B>
<P><B> remembered it, while reading your ghostly web page.</B>

<H3><A NAME=a>A Few Experiences</A>
</H3><P><B>by  meara@bc-alter.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>I have a few stories to tell,some of them my own experiences one that
of my</B>
<P><B>grandparents and one of my roommate. My Dad has often told me the story
of</B>
<P><B>when his parents were first married.My family is originally from
England.</B>
<P><B>My grandparents rented a small apartment that was inexpensive.During
their</B>
<P><B>first night there,they were woken up by a great deal of noise.They
opened</B>
<P><B>their eyes to see their belongings being thrown about the room,they
were</B>
<P><B>the only ones there.It escalated from there.Pictures flew from the</B>
<P><B>walls,their bedding was ripped to shreds and dishes were
smashed.Needless</B>
<P><B>to say,they moved out very quickly.Others attempted to live in the
same</B>
<P><B>suite but the same things would happen.Eventually,nobody would live</B>
<P><B>there.Nor,after tearing down the building did the activity end.It
continued</B>
<P><B>in the new one.That building was also torn down.Now,nothing stands
there,it</B>
<P><B>is an empty lot.</B>
<P><B>In 1977,when I was 16,we went on vacation in England to visit
relatives.My</B>
<P><B>parents,myself and my younger brother were touring a castle.We came
to a</B>
<P><B>set of stone steps leading up to a small tower.My Mom had decided to
stay</B>
<P><B>at the bottom and sit on a small bench as she had recently sprained
her</B>
<P><B>ankle.I was the last one up the steps.As I got to about the middle
of</B>
<P><B>stairs,I felt a hand in the middle of my back,like someone was making
sure</B>
<P><B>that I wouldn't fall backwards.I assumed that it was my Mom,and when
I</B>
<P><B>turned to look at her she was still on the bench and nobody was behind
me.</B>
<P><B>A few years later,when we were at home,I was sitting in the kitchen
at my</B>
<P><B>parents home.I had been doing my homework at the kitchen table as I
usually</B>
<P><B>did.I happend to glance up to see the figure of a woman dressed in
a long</B>
<P><B>flowing dress drift past the doorway of the kitchen and down the
hallway.I</B>
<P><B>sat speachless for a moment.When I finally worked up the courage to
tell my</B>
<P><B>Mom who was sitting in the living-room she looked at me and told me
that</B>
<P><B>she had seen the lady before but didn't tell anyone because she
thought</B>
<P><B>that we would think that she was crazy.A short time after this,my
parents</B>
<P><B>woke up one morning,to find that their bedspread had been neatly folded
to</B>
<P><B>the bottom of the bed,both of them had slept soundly through the
night.</B>
<P><B>Some years later,my Mom was babysitting one of the granddaughters.She</B>
<P><B>looked up to see Chelsey staring down the hallway."What are you
looking</B>
<P><B>at?" she asked her."The nice lady in the hall.But she has to go</B>
<P><B>now."Chelsey replied,and proceeded to wave "bye-bye".My Mom was</B>
<P><B>stunned.There ghost hadn't been seen for  some years and only seems
to</B>
<P><B>appear to the female members of our family.</B>
<P><B>About a year ago,my roommate Yvonne awoke to see a figure sitting on
the</B>
<P><B>edge of the bed which was up against the wall.She had an immediate
feeling</B>
<P><B>of fear and what she calls "the yucks".This happend fequently enough
that</B>
<P><B>her cat refused to sleep on the bed.I am Wiccan,so she asked me if
I could</B>
<P><B>do some sort of banishing ritual to rid the house of this unpleasant</B>
<P><B>spirit.One day when the house was empty,I did a ritual and the spirit
never</B>
<P><B>returned.</B>

<P>
<P><B>hello my name is jeff and about five years or so ago i had a paranormal
</B>
<P><B>experience.  i was at my friend, jaiman's house and he had told me
years</B>
<P><B>before this incident that there was a demon who plagued his family</B>
<P><B>for generations.  i didn't belive him until years after he told me
about</B>
<P><B>it i came over to his house to play guitar with him.  it was a normal</B>
<P><B>jam session when all of the sudden he stopped playing guitar and he
sat</B>
<P><B>down and opened up his bible.  i don't know why but he began reading
out</B>
<P><B>loud i thought he went mad or something, then i felt a feeling like
i</B>
<P><B>should be angry or intimidated about something ( i kind of get the</B>
<P><B>feeling just writng about it).  the hair on the back of my neck stod
on</B>
<P><B>it's end.  I felt something moving or maybe i heard something moving
in</B>
<P><B>the next room even though we were all alone in the house and i was
only</B>
<P><B>16 or so at the time.  Jaiman continued to read the bible and i
looked</B>
<P><B>behind me (because i had that feeling like someone was watching me).
</B>
<P><B>there hovering about 6" from the floor over top of my amp, was a</B>
<P><B>transparent sphere about 2'x2' that seemed to shimmer like water
(almost</B>
<P><B>like how the water ripples if you throw a rock into it)  the center
of</B>
<P><B>this sphere had tiny black spirels inside of it that floated in
circles.</B>
<P><B>jaiman acted like it wasn't even there and the next thing i know it</B>
<P><B>moved toward me.  </B>
<P><B>the next thing i remeber was the phone ringing and i looked at jaiman
to</B>
<P><B>answer it and he was still reading his bible.  on the phone was my</B>
<P><B>mother and she was mad because she had to pick me up and it was late</B>
<P><B>(about 10:30) that was at least an hour later than the time i rember</B>
<P><B>looking at on the clock in his room.  to this day i don't know what</B>
<P><B>happened to that hour.  when the phone rang the sphere was gone. </B>
<P><B>jaiman's family went through a divorce since then and he became </B>
<P><B>drug-using, alcoholic, unemployed  and married to his high school
sweet</B>
<P><B>heart who lives at that same house (his dad's house) and it is like
he</B>
<P><B>can't ever leave that house.  also before that night we were the best
of</B>
<P><B>friends after that night he began ignoring me and he doesn't speak
to me</B>
<P><B>any more.  i never saw anything that bizare before or after as that</B>
<P><B>thing i could not explain.  please reply to me and tell me what you</B>
<P><B>think happened that night and if there are any descriptions of
anything</B>
<P><B>like i saw.  that night bothers me to this day and i would love to
know</B>
<P><B>if anyone had a simular experiance.  some people tell me that this</B>
<P><B>happened because i believe in things like ghosts and other paranormal</B>
<P><B>things but just because you beleive in something doesn't mean that
it is</B>
<P><B>going to happen.  if you reply to my e-mail i'll send you more</B>
<P><B>information about the people who used to be my friends at that house
and</B>
<P><B>now i don't have any contact with now all over strange circumstances
and</B>
<P><B>ever since i stopped going to that house everything stange in my life</B>
<P><B>stopped and i have have had a normal life </B>

<H3><A NAME=jean>Jean</A>
</H3><P><B>by Haven@webtv.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>I am going to share something with you. I am not one of those who</B>
<P><B>believes in Ghosts or anything supernatural. Yet, something happened
30</B>
<P><B>years ago that gave me the goosepimples! This experience made me</B>
<P><B>realized that I cannot brushed it off as merely coincidence! </B>
<P>
<P><B>September 17th, 1967 , Seedy area of Los Angeles, CA....I was 17
years</B>
<P><B>old at that time. My alcoholic mother woked me up at 2:15 A.M.. she
was</B>
<P><B>crying hysterically. I knew how she behaves and reacts but that
morning</B>
<P><B>it was entirely different! Its as if she sobered up so fast that her</B>
<P><B>emotiions and reactions was not just her! She had stated that Jean
(her</B>
<P><B>older sister) had died. I looked around our small apartment. There
was</B>
<P><B>no one around...just us. We did not have any phones (being Deaf) .
I</B>
<P><B>asked her how she know that Jean had passed away? She said Jean's
face</B>
<P><B>had appeared before her in bed. She saw Jean's apparation. At first
I</B>
<P><B>had figured it was her drinking that made her seeing things. But what</B>
<P><B>threw me off was her reaction. I stayed with her for about 45 minutes</B>
<P><B>then went back to bed. She looked at me and said ," I knew you don't</B>
<P><B>believe me, Frankie!".  I woked up at 10 in the morning and found her
in</B>
<P><B>a state of mourning in the living room chair. She had me to go see</B>
<P><B>Grandma (her mom).  Grandma lived two blocks from us. Mom gave e a
note</B>
<P><B>for grandma. I was half way to grandma's place when I met Step</B>
<P><B>grandfather. He was on the way to our place to let us know something</B>
<P><B>happened. He told me  that, "Aunt Jean died at 2  o'clock this</B>
<P><B>morning."! I was stunned to say the least. When my step grandfather
and</B>
<P><B>I walked in , mom looked at us and yelled at me.. " I told you Jean's</B>
<P><B>dead! You did not believed me!" . Step grandfather was puzzled and</B>
<P><B>stunned that mom knew Jean had passed away.  She asked him if Jean
had</B>
<P><B>died. He replied yes at 2 this morning. This really gave me the
creeps!</B>
<P><B>I cannot think it was coincidence...too much of a coincidence!
Somehow</B>
<P><B>mom had a message from Jean !       </B>
<P><B>Nowadays,  I don't go around saying there's no such thing as ghosts
or</B>
<P><B>paranormal things! Mom's dead...she died 3 years later (1970). What
was</B>
<P><B>so interesting about her death...was that she was so worried about
her</B>
<P><B>dying coma twin sister Mary (my aunt) yet mom died first. Mary did
not</B>
<P><B>know her twin sister, Isabel (my mom) had passed away then one week</B>
<P><B>later Mary passed away without ever regaining conscious. Mentally,
mom</B>
<P><B>outlived Mary but physically Mary outlived mom. They are buried
beside</B>
<P><B>each other in Los Angeles cemeterey. They shared everything from
birth,</B>
<P><B>though childhood years then in death! </B>
<P>
<P><B>I will never forget this experience! </B>

<H3><A NAME=from>2 Stories from the Carolinas</A>
</H3><P><B>by CAVEONE@prodigy.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>I also have 2 stories to tell you.The first one took place somewhere</B>
<P><B>in South Carolina.</B>
<P>
<P><B>About 2 years ago my aunt went to a friends house.She said just
looking</B>
<P><B>at the place gave her chills.when she talked to the woman of the
house</B>
<P><B>she said her sons were the first to notice anything unusual.Her sons
are</B>
<P><B>about two years apart.The oldest being around the age of six.Well the</B>
<P><B>boys said that during the night they would hear footsteps , but the
lady</B>
<P><B>said it's probly just the house because it's an older house.A couple
of</B>
<P><B>weeks later she notice that the boys would just stop in maybe the</B>
<P><B>middle  of the room or in front of a wall and start having a</B>
<P><B>conversation.Well their mother thought they had imagenary
friends.When</B>
<P><B>she would ask the boys what they were doing and the said talking to
the</B>
<P><B>little boy.She asked "Well where does he live," and they said "in the</B>
<P><B>house." She asked </B>
<P><B>"Where?" and they said "in our room."After that she started to hear
the</B>
<P><B>boy talking to them at night.Well then she started to see a lady
appear.</B>
<P><B>She did not fell threatin.In the morning they would smell fried</B>
<P><B>bacon.The lady that lived there said that it didn't bother her.The
boys</B>
<P><B>said that the lady that she had seen was the mother.The boys also
said</B>
<P><B>that their was a baby in the house.Well she only seen one sign that
a</B>
<P><B>baby was in the house and it's the only thing that ever scared
her.One</B>
<P><B>day when she was going to wash her sheets , she lifted the matress
and a</B>
<P><B>circle of flowers were aranged in the shape of a baby.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The next story happened to a family my parents knew.This story takes</B>
<P><B>place in a town called Gastonia in North Carolina, my hometown.</B>
<P>
<P><B>This house was a good size house and was new.According to the family</B>
<P><B>they said that they would see shadows and balls of light going down
the</B>
<P><B>hall at night.One time she said that 2 feet tall men were running up
and</B>
<P><B>down the stairs.Pictures would also fall off the walls , they would
hear</B>
<P><B>voices , doors would slam and open.The family had the house blessed
many</B>
<P><B>times , had exsersisims performed and nothing worked .I think it's</B>
<P><B>because they aren't Christians and bleive in God finally they moved
and</B>
<P><B>had the house tore down.I ride by the land the house was built on all</B>
<P><B>the time, because it's located on a major road,and no one has bought</B>
<P><B>that land in years.</B>

<P>
<H3><A NAME=tower>The Water Tower</A>
</H3><P><B>by jgwilliam@shoal.net.au</B>
<P>
<P><B>This occurence happened to my friend Collin P. and</B>
<P><B>myself John G. in about 1959. At the time we were</B>
<P><B>about 13 and still attending Hagley RC High School.</B>
<P><B>The time was about 8.00 - 8.30 PM, the month I no</B>
<P><B>longer remember but it was in the Northern Hemisphere</B>
<P><B>Autumn - Winter because it was dark quite early.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The local town was Kidderminster in the County of</B>
<P><B>Worcestershire, roughly in the middle of England.</B>
<P><B>The area was Birchen Coppice, a housing estate owned</B>
<P><B>by the local council, it was then, a respectable area</B>
<P><B>as it was only probably 8 years old, I believe the </B>
<P><B>area is now more of a slum but I haven't been there</B>
<P><B>in 33 years as we moved in the middle '60's and then</B>
<P><B>I re-located to Australia in '67.</B>
<P>
<P><B>A bit of geography is needed here so;</B>
<P>
<P><B>The street we lived in was Kinver Ave, the rear of our</B>
<P><B>houses backed onto undeveloped bushland which went on</B>
<P><B>into some pretty, unspoiled countryside in most directions.</B>
<P><B>However the area just to the rear and to the south was</B>
<P><B>called "The Burlish Camp". This Camp was built in WW2 as</B>
<P><B>a repatriation hospital for US servicemen. After WW2 it</B>
<P><B>was used to house Polish war refugees. As children we</B>
<P><B>played, mixed and schooled with their children. In the</B>
<P><B>middle '50s the people were re located and the whole area</B>
<P><B>was knocked flat, except for one lonley structure called</B>
<P><B>the "Water Tower".</B>
<P><B>As the name suggests it was exactly</B>
<P><B>that, a very large brick tower, from childhood memory</B>
<P><B>about 50ft by 50ft by 80 - 100ft high with a giant water</B>
<P><B>tank in the top. It was used to supply the Burlish Camp</B>
<P><B>with water.There were 8 windows, 4 at the rear and 4 at</B>
<P><B>the front. The first pair about 30ft from the ground, the</B>
<P><B>next pair another 30ft up. There was a steel door on the</B>
<P><B>southern side but it was bricked up in the middle '50s.</B>
<P><B>There was never any electricity to it and it was now</B>
<P><B>inaccessible.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Back to the story;</B>
<P><B>Colin and I were just hanging out, at the end of our</B>
<P><B>street under a street light.This street light was at</B>
<P><B>the junction where our tarred street met with a wide</B>
<P><B>dirt track that lead over to the Burlish Camp, straight</B>
<P><B>passed the Water Tower and onto a small town called </B>
<P><B>Stourport-on-Severn about 4 miles further on.</B>
<P><B>During our conversation Colin said " hey look at those</B>
<P><B>lights in the Water Tower", (the tower was probably 1/4</B>
<P><B>mile away but could be made out in the moonlight).</B>
<P>
<P><B>I was quite supprised, because we could see some form of</B>
<P><B>moving or blinking light in the window area of the Tower.</B>
<P><B>The light colour did not appear as normal to what we call</B>
<P><B>light ie, candles and incandescent light seems to have a</B>
<P><B>warm and yellow content, this light light was very sallow</B>
<P><B>white to opaque. A short time later, about 20 yds from us</B>
<P><B>on the dirt track at angle of about 45 degrees we could</B>
<P><B>see a light, the same colour light that was in the Tower.</B>
<P>
<P><B>From this point on, in the following events, I have no</B>
<P><B>recollection of time; I remember we  thought it was someone</B>
<P><B>on a bicycle because the light seemed to fall to the ground,</B>
<P><B>we started giggling saying it must be someone drunk and fell</B>
<P><B>off their bike. </B>
<P><B>In the next instance, I remember myself drawn and staring</B>
<P><B>wide eyed at the figure of a man particularly at the face,</B>
<P><B>it was side on, very distinguinshable features; vertical</B>
<P><B>flat forehead, long pointed nose, sunken very staring eyes,</B>
<P><B>because my concentration was so intense and to the head,</B>
<P><B>I did not seem to observe any body detail, except the lack</B>
<P><B>of normal motion movements, he appeared to float along.</B>
<P><B>Opaque, we could see right through him.</B>
<P><B>Also the ground all around  seemed to crackle, as if</B>
<P><B>Rice Chrispies were being trodden on. Next, I picked up</B>
<P><B>a stone and threw it in his direction, Colin was pulling</B>
<P><B>at my left arm screaming at me not to throw it. The stone,</B>
<P><B>I estimate, fell short but in line, as it hit the soft</B>
<P><B>grass with a "thud" the man brought up his arm as if to</B>
<P><B>protect his face, my legs went to jelly, I fell to the ground</B>
<P><B>and the vision disappeared, Colin ran off holding his ears</B>
<P><B>and screaming as he stumbled off running through peoples</B>
<P><B>front gardens. </B>
<P><B>BUT..... I vividly recall floating above the street light,</B>
<P><B>I can remember detail such as the bird droppings on top of</B>
<P><B>the post. I watched Colin pulling my left arm, me throwing</B>
<P><B>the stone, collapsing on the ground and Colin running away</B>
<P><B>screaming. I recall a lady from a nearby house coming out</B>
<P><B>and bending over me. </B>
<P><B>The next thing I remember was lying on the ground and a</B>
<P><B>lady, Mrs Sayers, bending over me asking if I was ok, and</B>
<P><B>"what was all that shouting"?</B>
<P><B>I ran home very scared. Collin lost his hearing for 2 days.</B>
<P><B>We made a pact not to tell for fear of ridicule, anyhow</B>
<P><B>as time went by we told, and we got laughed at. But I could</B>
<P><B>never see anything funny about it, this occurrence left an</B>
<P><B>indelible mark on me.</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>Some years later at age, maybe, 16, I had been out fox</B>
<P><B>hunting with a companion Peter G. Peter wasn't a local and</B>
<P><B>was unfamilliar with our area, we were heading back to</B>
<P><B>my home, on a "Dirt" motorcycle at about 2.30-3.00 am,</B>
<P><B>Peter was pillion, I was riding. When we were directly</B>
<P><B>in front of the Tower, a few hundred yards away, Peter</B>
<P><B>shouted to me "who lives over there", I said,"overwhere"?</B>
<P><B>as I concentrated on riding with no lights; "over there",</B>
<P><B>to your left, as I looked to my left I was looking at</B>
<P><B>the Tower. My eyes nearly popped, my jaw dropped, I was agast. </B>
<P><B>Each of the windows in the tower had those same lights as</B>
<P><B>years before, but even more startling, we could distinctly</B>
<P><B>see  people like figures, lined up as if waiting to go in</B>
<P><B>where the door used to be, the figures were not</B>
<P><B>distinguishable seperatley but were the same opaque colour</B>
<P><B>as the "little white man". That motorbike became the fastest</B>
<P><B>bike in the land.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Many years later, talking to my late dad, we were passing</B>
<P><B>the time talking about our familly,being kids, where we lived,</B>
<P><B>neighbours and the like,dad was telling me how in the  post war</B>
<P><B>years 1956 - 1960 times were hard and 5 or 6 of the local</B>
<P><B>ladies would work continuous night shifts in an electrical</B>
<P><B>insulator manufacturing plant, in the above mentioned town</B>
<P><B>called Stourport-on-Severn. He said they would cycle 8 - 10</B>
<P><B>miles to work each way instead of 3 miles short cut through</B>
<P><B>the Burlish Camp. I said "how come dad", oh he replied,</B>
<P><B>"Mrs Hawker next door says that none of the woemen </B>
<P><B>feel good going that way, it always seems very still and</B>
<P><B>eerie when they goe past the Tower, and when they come home</B>
<P><B>in the morning, the birds are singing but, not up there by</B>
<P><B>the Tower, its always still and quiet". Dad chuckled.</B>
<P><B>I didn't, I knew just what they meant.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Well, in the mid to late 60's the tower was to be removed</B>
<P><B>to make way for a communications repeater station, the local</B>
<P><B>news was there to cover the big Bang, it took 3 days of</B>
<P><B>drilling and explosives to finally fell the Tower, the</B>
<P><B>experts were scratching their heads, they couldn't</B>
<P><B>understand how it stayed up through so many explosive attempts.</B>

<H3><A NAME=more>More Williamsburg Stories</A>
</H3><P><B>by kbhigg@maila.wm.edu</B>
<P>
<P><B>Hi It's KAt again, stories con't about Williamsburg....</B>
<P><B>I left off with a story about the girls Elizabeth and Anastasia...</B>
<P><B>The Peyton Radolph house has some VERY current links...</B>
<P><B>In Williamsburg, there are police that patrol both the campus and the</B>
<P><B>old historical district. What they do at night, is go through EVERY</B>
<P><B>house that is not inhabited but used for museum purposes-one of them</B>
<P><B>being the Peyton Randoplph house. There are two main streets in the</B>
<P><B>colonial district-Duke Of Glouster (DOG street, closed off to
motorists,</B>
<P><B>just for tourists to freely wander around) and Prince Henry Street,</B>
<P><B>which runs parrallel to DOG and is open to mototrists. Every night,
two</B>
<P><B>cops have the duty of checking the houses-one takes DOG, one takes</B>
<P><B>Prince Henry. Peyton Randolph is on PH Street. Well, one night in the</B>
<P><B>early 1990's, two cops did their usual round. WEll, PArtner #1 came
back</B>
<P><B>on time, but partner #2 was no where to be found. SO, a search patrol</B>
<P><B>went out around Williamsburg, and they found his patrol ca, door
open,</B>
<P><B>lights on, right in front of the Peyton Randolph house. THe front
door</B>
<P><B>was ajar, and when they went  inside, they found the officer on, the</B>
<P><B>floor, revolver drawn and cocked, pointing to something on the</B>
<P><B>staircase. He was in shock, his face a ghastly white and twisted in</B>
<P><B>terror. He has never spoken about the incident. He was
subsequentially</B>
<P><B>transferred to work as a ccampus police patroller. Sadly enough, he
was</B>
<P><B>the victem of a frat prank during his time at WIlliam and Mary. The
Frat</B>
<P><B>Phi Tau had gotten ahold of the med school cadavers and taken thehead</B>
<P><B>off of one and placed it on the sundial in front of the library</B>
<P><B>here-which is a very central location. He is now residing at Eastern</B>
<P><B>STate, the local mental insitiution 5 miles off campus. </B>
<P><B>A couple years later, another officer was patrolling the area and was</B>
<P><B>making his usuall rounds at the Peyton Randolphg home. Now, PR
(Peyton</B>
<P><B>RAndolph will now be PR) has three floors-2 above ground, and a
celler.</B>
<P><B>THe officer went inside and looked around. Finding nothing on the
amin</B>
<P><B>two floors, he opened the celler door and proceeded to go into the</B>
<P><B>darkness. He was just two steps down when he haerd the door creaking</B>
<P><B>shut---He tuned around, and when the door shut completely, he found
he</B>
<P><B>could not move-He was in a jello like state, free of movement, but
he</B>
<P><B>could feel something very real pressing around him-something cold and</B>
<P><B>very frightening. The next thing he knew, the door opened, and his</B>
<P><B>partner was standing in the doorjam. The partner asked the offcer
where</B>
<P><B>the hell had he been, and the officer, climbing the stairs out of the</B>
<P><B>celler, gave him a confused look and asked him what he was talking</B>
<P><B>about. Apparently, the officer had bee mising for 6 hours, none of
which</B>
<P><B>he can account for. Ever since then, the PR house must be searched
by</B>
<P><B>two people, no matter what.</B>
<P><B>In Williamsburg, Christmas is a major tourist attraction. EAch of the</B>
<P><B>houses' windows are lighted with a candle placed on the windowsill
and</B>
<P><B>are kept lighted throughout  the season. One lady was doing all of
them,</B>
<P><B>and had been for the past several years. I believe it was 1993 that
the</B>
<P><B>following incident occured. She had finished her nightly illuminating</B>
<P><B>rounds and went off to bed. Arounf midnight her supervisor called her</B>
<P><B>and told her the PR house windows were not all lighted. THinking that</B>
<P><B>was odd, she got up and went out there, and sure enough, the
upperleft</B>
<P><B>hand room was not lighted, and the blinds were drawn-the only drawn</B>
<P><B>blinds in the house.  So, she relit the lights and went back home.</B>
<P><B>Fifteen minutes later, the phone rang and it was her supervisor
again,</B>
<P><B>reorting that the lights were still out. Frustrated, she went back,
and</B>
<P><B>the same thing happened-drawn blinds, no lights. She relit the lights</B>
<P><B>and trkked back home, tired, annoyed and puzzled. Again, fifteen
minutes</B>
<P><B>after her arrival in her warm bed, her sup calls her and tells her
she</B>
<P><B>better light the candles, or it's her job. Angry, she storms off to
the</B>
<P><B>house and finds the same thing--Drawn blinds, no candles lit in that
one</B>
<P><B>room. She goes there and relights the candles, and opens the blinds.
At</B>
<P><B>the top of the stairs, she muttered "That damn ghost," and suddenly,
she</B>
<P><B>is shoved very hard down the stairs-so hard, that she broke both her</B>
<P><B>legs and both her arms. Medical examiners said that she was hit with
a</B>
<P><B>force equal to that of a mac truck driving 25 mph. She lived, and
sued</B>
<P><B>the City of Williamsburg-THey settled out of court, and this case is
in</B>
<P><B>the city court on the books.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Let me reiterrate something... Iwas at this house last night, and I
have</B>
<P><B>never been so scared of an inatimate object. THe house has a definite</B>
<P><B>personality...I will never go there by myself. I have goosebumps and
am</B>
<P><B>scared to death of telling this...The house is less than a mile away</B>
<P><B>from my dorm.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Next to the PR house is a path that leads from this house to the</B>
<P><B>Govenor's palace. THe Govenor's palace  was used for the govenor of</B>
<P><B>Virginia before the capital was moved from Williamsburg to Richmond.
A</B>
<P><B>very stately structure, it is complete with a  very large bush maze
out</B>
<P><B>back and lovely gardens. Around the main part is a 7 foot brick
fence.</B>
<P><B>THe  palace is about 50 yards to the left of the PR place. It too has
7</B>
<P><B>foot bushes-These bushes have pklaces carved in complete with benche</B>
<P><B>that make for very nice hiding places. WEll, during the 18th century,</B>
<P><B>two men were courting the same girl-something that was never to be
done</B>
<P><B>in  high society. Well, the man that lived in the PR House was on his</B>
<P><B>way home fom a meeting in the palace. He used the shortcut path. In
one</B>
<P><B>of the inlets, his competitor was hidin. When the unfortunate man
came</B>
<P><B>upon him, he was dragged ino the bushes and stabbed 37 times. Only
a</B>
<P><B>black slave was witness to this, and during</B>
<P><B>this time, blacks were forbidden to testify against white masters.
THe</B>
<P><B>death therefore had no witnesses and his death was never avenged. Now</B>
<P><B>the person giving the ghost tour told us that when going through this</B>
<P><B>path at night, you must always look down, and if you see the shoes
of a</B>
<P><B>colonial man, DO NOT LOOK UP, for it is the ghost of the murderer.
OUr</B>
<P><B>tour guide has confessed to seeing the shoes twice, and he swears
that</B>
<P><B>this path is the most frightening thing in WIlliamsburg. </B>
<P>
<P><B>THese two stories lend to the dramatic atmosphere of Williamsburg:
(All</B>
<P><B>true)</B>
<P><B>Now, there is another path on the other side of the Palace, which
leads</B>
<P><B>directly to an elementary school. If you travel about 10 yards down
the</B>
<P><B>path (which runs parrallel to the wall surtrounding the palace) the
wall</B>
<P><B>turns into a fence, about 5 feet high. It's a tradition at William
and</B>
<P><B>MAry to "Jump the Wall"--that is, sneak into the maze at night by</B>
<P><B>jumping over the wall. Well, this has been down since it was built-in</B>
<P><B>the 17th century. William and Mary went coed in the 1920's. One night,
a</B>
<P><B>couple in their 20's went to jump the wall. THe man went first, just
to</B>
<P><B>check and make sure no cops were in there. When he came back, he</B>
<P><B>couldn't find her. He jumped over the fence and landed on her
body-Her</B>
<P><B>throat had been slashed, and she had died while he was inside. Now,
I</B>
<P><B>mentioned earlier that there is a mental instituin here. This one,
in</B>
<P><B>the 20's was used for the violentlly insane, and one of them esceped.</B>
<P><B>THe land around the palace was not developed untill much later, and
his</B>
<P><B>body was nevr found in the deep woods--There have never been any</B>
<P><B>sightings of this man's ghost, but it adds to the drama.....</B>
<P>
<P><B>However, there has been a ghost of grey cloaked yound man seen
several</B>
<P><B>times within the maze. He says nothing but "i'm going to kill you"
over</B>
<P><B>and over again. It is thought that he was a confederate soldiar
killed</B>
<P><B>on that soil who is so bitter about being killed in the prime of his</B>
<P><B>life that he wants to take away the lives of those who are his age.
</B>
<P>
<P><B>Now, as mentioned above, if you follow the path, you will come upon
an</B>
<P><B>elemntary school, whose name has slipped my mind. It was used for
upper</B>
<P><B>class white children whose families wanted to ensure their proper</B>
<P><B>environment. When desegregation was forced upon the school, many
people</B>
<P><B>were upset and many children were enrolled in private schools.</B>
<P><B>Well, one Friday afternoon, a frantic black mother called the school,</B>
<P><B>claiming that her two sons had not yet returned. THe principal;
assured</B>
<P><B>her, that being a beautifull day and a friday, the boys would turn
up</B>
<P><B>eventually. However, Monday came around and the boys were still not</B>
<P><B>home. THe police came in and searched the entire area, finding
nothing.</B>
<P><B>However, that day, the school was forced to stop their curriculum for</B>
<P><B>the day due to a high pitched whirring noise that droned on and on
and</B>
<P><B>drowned out the rest of the voices. The police came in and started
to</B>
<P><B>search the school for both the boys and the source of the noise. THey</B>
<P><B>searched the first and second floors, but they came up empty. the
third</B>
<P><B>floor was used for both storage and 5th grade classrooms.THis is
where</B>
<P><B>the noise was the strongest. THey tried to open the storage area
door,</B>
<P><B>but it was locked fast. It took them a while to get it open, but when</B>
<P><B>they did, they wished it could have stayed shut forever. One officer
had</B>
<P><B>to leave for fear  of passing out of disgust and terror. Inside, one
one</B>
<P><B>wall, was a bunch of desk, arranged in a makeshift courtroom/trial
 that</B>
<P><B>resembled a lynching setup. THe other side contained the remains of
the</B>
<P><B>two little boys, horribly disfigured and hung up on meathooks. Every
day</B>
<P><B>after the murders, that whirring sound could be heard at 11:00 am
sharp.</B>
<P><B>Finally, they got a priest to bless the rooms and they shut the third</B>
<P><B>floor off untill this day--THe whirring noise can still be heard evry</B>
<P><B>nowand then, but never as loud, and it is very infrequent. Because
the</B>
<P><B>childrfen's murderer was never caught, people believe that they are</B>
<P><B>crying out of vengence for their deaths. It was suspected that the
old</B>
<P><B>janitor at the time had killed them, for he was very against</B>
<P><B>desegregation and was from the times where hate crimes and lynchings</B>
<P><B>were very common.</B>

<H3><A NAME=parents>My Parents' House</A>
</H3><P><B>by shamon@lanvision.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>I have debated whether or not to write.  I'm not saying my parent's</B>
<P><B>house is haunted and I'm not saying it ISN"T haunted.  I'll just
write</B>
<P><B>about the things that I've seen happen there and let someone else</B>
<P><B>decide.  I'd appreciate it, that if you do use this story on your
page</B>
<P><B>that I remain anonymous.   The only reason I decided to write to you
is</B>
<P><B>that your story sounds very similar to mine.  Maybe I won't sound as</B>
<P><B>crazy as I feel.  </B>
<P>
<P><B> My parents moved into their house when I was thirteen.  We had just</B>
<P><B>moved all our furniture into the house and were getting the smaller</B>
<P><B>boxes in.  I was sitting on my bed unpacking a box when my entire bed</B>
<P><B>moved about two inches across the floor.  I froze.  I didn't know
what</B>
<P><B>to do.  It didn't take me long to figure out I should probably get
out</B>
<P><B>of there so I did.  When I told my parents, they just laughed.  They</B>
<P><B>said my bed was probably set up a little crooked and that me sitting
on</B>
<P><B>it evened it out.  OK, fair enough explanation.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Since then, I've heard knocking on my wall at night (I'm on the
second</B>
<P><B>floor and the outside of the wall is brick.).  My room is always
cold.</B>
<P><B>(That's been blamed on bad insulation.)  I bought a lamp at a second</B>
<P><B>hand store and didn't pay too much attention when it would turn on
and</B>
<P><B>off by itself.  I just threw it away.  I figured someone gave it away</B>
<P><B>because it didn't work right.  Then my NEW lamp (using another
outlet)</B>
<P><B>started to do the same thing.  There is a bedroom/den right next to
mine</B>
<P><B>with a touch lamp.  That started coming on and off by itself too.
 Now,</B>
<P><B>my parents have actually seen this.  They say it's not a ghost.  I
told</B>
<P><B>them that they should get the wiring checked in the house then.  That</B>
<P><B>would be another explanation for it and it could start a fire.  Well,</B>
<P><B>they refuse to do that and the lights are still going on and off. 
</B>
<P>
<P><B>I guess I'll tell the least scary things that have happened there.
 I</B>
<P><B>really get freaked out, so talking about some things really shake me
up.</B>
<P><B>The most "harmless" things that have happened involved my cat and my</B>
<P><B>dad's truck.</B>
<P>
<P><B>My cat was really cool.  She wasn't the stereotypical cat you'd see
in</B>
<P><B>the movies.  She would come to me when I called her.  Also, when she
was</B>
<P><B>sitting in a chair and she saw me walk into the room she would scoot</B>
<P><B>over so I could sit down next to her.  To sum it all up, she was a</B>
<P><B>sweetheart.  When she died, I was miserable.  I wanted her back.  I
kept</B>
<P><B>having dreams about her, I guessed it was because I missed her so
much.</B>
<P><B>Then one day my friend Nicole and I were down in our laundry room</B>
<P><B>getting a two litter of pop off the shelf.  (Our kitchen is pretty
small</B>
<P><B>so the shelf down there serves as a pantry.)  I might want to mention</B>
<P><B>that the shelf sits right by our crawl space (which our dog whimpers
in</B>
<P><B>fear at if we try to take him over there.)  Well, I look over into
the</B>
<P><B>space and something's looking at me right back.  It looked like a
black</B>
<P><B>cat.  My cat was a tabby so she looked nothing like this.  I say it</B>
<P><B>looked like a black cat because I couldn't really see it.  I could
just</B>
<P><B>make out the eyes.  I screamed and dragged my friend upstairs.  She</B>
<P><B>didn't have a clue what was going on but she knew I didn't get that</B>
<P><B>scared over nothing.  My parents went back down with a flash light.
 It</B>
<P><B>was really dirty back in there since we never used it.  This time
they</B>
<P><B>sort of believed me.  They didn't see the cat, but they did see the
paw</B>
<P><B>prints in the dirt.  (They sort of looked wet)  They said it must
have</B>
<P><B>been a raccoon or a possum, but we never did figure out how it could</B>
<P><B>have gotten in or out of the house.   I was almost sure it was my
cat,</B>
<P><B>although I don't know why she had looked so different.  For a while
I</B>
<P><B>liked the thought of my cat being around, but then it dawned on me
that</B>
<P><B>was a pretty selfish idea.  If she really was still around and I was</B>
<P><B>what was keeping her here and there was a better place for her
somewhere</B>
<P><B>else, then I should let her go.  That night I silently spoke to her
and</B>
<P><B>told her if she wanted to leave she could and that I would
understand.</B>
<P><B>(No wonder my parents think I'm cracked, I thought)    Just then, my
mom</B>
<P><B>screamed.  I ran into her bedroom.  She was staring at the window
where</B>
<P><B>my cat used to sit.  She said she saw my cat sitting on the window
sill</B>
<P><B>but she was transparent.  Then she turned into a ball of light that</B>
<P><B>looked kind of like a big firefly and went out the window.  I didn't</B>
<P><B>mention what I had just done.  I knew by this time talking about
ghosts,</B>
<P><B>much less talking TO ghosts, would have my parents furious with me.</B>
<P><B>When I asked my mom about it the next morning, she snapped at me
"Don't</B>
<P><B>be so silly, I just had a bad dream."  Subject dropped.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I have had several nightmares, ever since I was little.  It seems,</B>
<P><B>though, that they escalated when we moved into this house.  My
parents</B>
<P><B>are used to this by now and aren't too concerned.  Right around when
I</B>
<P><B>turned 16, I had a really bad one about my dad's truck.  In my dream,
I</B>
<P><B>was driving along in my dad's truck, when all of a sudden I was
talking</B>
<P><B>to these two people.  They said I had died.  I told them I didn't
want</B>
<P><B>to and couldn't they send me back?  They said my body was obviously
dead</B>
<P><B>and they could not.  I asked them if I could say good bye to everyone</B>
<P><B>first.  They looked very sad.  One turned to the other and in a kind
of</B>
<P><B>pitying voice said "She doesn't want to die yet."  At that point I
woke</B>
<P><B>up, very much afraid.  In come my parents, apparently I had yelled.
 I</B>
<P><B>told them about my bad dream.  They comforted me then went back to
their</B>
<P><B>room.  Needless to say I would NEVER get in that truck.  My parents
flat</B>
<P><B>out called me stupid for this.  They'd roll their eyes in disgust.
 I</B>
<P><B>still wouldn't go anywhere in it.  This went on for several years and
I</B>
<P><B>really can't say I blame them for their reaction.  It wasn't until
I was</B>
<P><B>in college that something actually happened.  Nicole (the same friend</B>
<P><B>who was with me when I saw the cat) was over to help my mom and I
with</B>
<P><B>our yard sale.  My dad asked me if I wanted to go to his family
picnic</B>
<P><B>with him.  Our conversation about going places usually went something</B>
<P><B>like this,</B>
<P><B>"Do you want to go?"</B>
<P><B>"Are you taking your truck?"</B>
<P><B>"Well, yeah...."</B>
<P><B>"No, I can't go then."</B>
<P><B>My mom muttered something under her breath and my dad just waved his</B>
<P><B>hand at me and left.  My mom looked at me for a minute then walked
into</B>
<P><B>the house without saying a word as my dad pulled out of the driveway.</B>
<P><B>Nicole gave me a gee-I-feel-awkward grin.  I had previously told her</B>
<P><B>about everything that had been happening in that house.  I had to
tell</B>
<P><B>someone, I thought I was going crazy!  A few hours later my mom got
a</B>
<P><B>phone call.  She called me inside and Nicole followed.  My dad had
been</B>
<P><B>in a wreck.  Someone coming the opposite way near the park had a
camper</B>
<P><B>hitched on to their car.  When they went around the corner, the
camper</B>
<P><B>went over into my dad's lane making him swerve off the road.  From
what</B>
<P><B>I heard it was a pretty steep drop and his truck played like a
pinball</B>
<P><B>bouncing against a lot of trees.  Thank God, he was OK.  No broken
bones</B>
<P><B>or anything.  Just a few scrapes here and there.  We were really</B>
<P><B>relieved.  Of course, what had stopped him down that steep hill was</B>
<P><B>smacking into a tree.  It totally wiped out the passenger side so
that</B>
<P><B>part of the roof of the cab was almost at dashboard level.  Needless
to</B>
<P><B>say, I would've been a pancake.  Nicole sat down on the couch with
me.</B>
<P><B>I looked at her and said, "You know, I just had a bad feeling about
that</B>
<P><B>truck.."  My mom glared at me and very firmly told me to 'SHUT UP.'</B>
<P><B>Subject dropped.   </B>
<P>
<P><B>This stuff really scares me.  It happens all the time there.  I've
since</B>
<P><B>moved out and am just terrified to go back there to spend the night.
 My</B>
<P><B>parents have since gotten locks for the bedroom doors to lock
yourself</B>
<P><B>in at night (they will even remind me to do it when I come to visit)</B>
<P><B>although they still won't admit anything's wrong.  Like I said, I
just</B>
<P><B>mentioned the nicer occurrences that didn't scare me as much.
 Luckily,</B>
<P><B>where I live now, everything's peaceful.  </B>

<H3> <A NAME=ghostly>Ghostly Co-Worker</A>
</H3><P><B>by Karen.L.Alligier@boeing.com </B>
<P>
<P><B>I have a friend who has amazing powers when it comes to communicating</B>
<P><B>with spirits.  A couple of things come to mind when I think of her</B>
<P><B>abilities.  The hair on the back of my neck still stands up when I
think</B>
<P><B>of these two incidents.</B>
<P>
<P><B>One deals with a coworker.  This woman reported to my friend in a</B>
<P><B>supervisor/subordinate capacity.  For the purpose of this writing,
we</B>
<P><B>will call the woman Mary and the supervisor Ann.  Mary and Ann had</B>
<P><B>become good friends in the year or so they worked together.  Mary was</B>
<P><B>married to a man who had two grown boys by a previous marriage.  From</B>
<P><B>the stories that Mary told Ann, the marriage was not good and Mary's</B>
<P><B>relationship with the grown children was strained.  Mary drank a
little</B>
<P><B>bit; but not to the point where it affected her work.   One morning
Mary</B>
<P><B>did not show up for work.  Around 8:30 or so in the morning Ann began
to</B>
<P><B>feel as if something was wrong and tried to call Mary's house.  She
go</B>
<P><B>no answer.  She tried again and again throughout the morning because
she</B>
<P><B>just felt as if something was terribly wrong.  At last around noon</B>
<P><B>Mary's husband answered the phone and informed Ann Mary had killed</B>
<P><B>herself by letting the car run in the garage while she sat in it. 
Ann</B>
<P><B>did not feel good about what she heard and called the police to tell</B>
<P><B>them she believed that Mary did not kill herself but possibly was</B>
<P><B>murdered.  The police took the statement, but to her knowledge,
nothing</B>
<P><B>came of it.  Now, here is where the story takes on that hair raising</B>
<P><B>turn.....About a week or so after Mary's funeral, Ann saw Mary
walking</B>
<P><B>around the office area.  Ann's office was situated where she could
look</B>
<P><B>out her office door and see the open bay area where her people sat
at</B>
<P><B>their desks.  Ann would look up and see Mary passing in front of her</B>
<P><B>door, or see her walking in the back of the room and one time saw her</B>
<P><B>sitting at her desk.  When Ann would get up to investigate, Mary was
no</B>
<P><B>where around AND, no one else had seen her.  This went on for a
couple</B>
<P><B>of week and Ann was getting a little upset.  She felt as if Mary was</B>
<P><B>trying to tell her something, but she didn't know what.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>One night a Mary was driving home late (very dark outside), she</B>
<P><B>suddendly had a feeling that Mary was sitting in the passenger seat.
</B>
<P><B>Ann was frightened, but did not look towards the seat fearing she
would</B>
<P><B>wreck her car if she actually SAW Mary sitting there.  So, she said,</B>
<P><B>"what is it you want, you are frightening me Mary!".  As soon as she</B>
<P><B>said these words, the feeling went away.  Ann had to pull over to the</B>
<P><B>side of the road and get control of herself.  Mary has never returned</B>
<P><B>and Ann is not sure what Mary wanted.  Ann is still convinced that
Mary</B>
<P><B>did NOT commit suicide.</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>Another story about Ann deals with peer supervisor who worked at
another</B>
<P><B>location.  We'll call this peer Karen.  Karen's husband, Karen and
Ann</B>
<P><B>were good friends.  Karen's husband, Don had a medical condition</B>
<P><B>(diabetes sp?) which lead to the amputation of both of his legs.  It</B>
<P><B>also eventually caused his death.  When Don became seriously ill and
it</B>
<P><B>appeared his death was near, Ann flew to be with Karen.  Ann had to
stay</B>
<P><B>in a hotel and commute to the hospital where Don was slowly fading
away.</B>
<P><B>The night before he died, Ann was alone in her hotel about 3:00 in
the</B>
<P><B>morning when she felt Don's presence in her room.  She said out loud
to</B>
<P><B>Don, "what is it you want Don?" and she heard him respond that he was</B>
<P><B>there to say goodbye and that he was checking out at about 2:30 that</B>
<P><B>day.  She said it wasn't as if he was talking to her as you and I
would</B>
<P><B>converse, but as if she heard his voice in her head.  He told her not
to</B>
<P><B>worry that they would have their dance some day in heaven.  (Ann used
to</B>
<P><B>tease Don that he needed to get out of his wheel chair and take her
and</B>
<P><B>Karen dancing). </B>
<P>
<P><B>The next morning as she arrive at the hospital to be with Karen
around</B>
<P><B>8:30 a.m., she relayed to Karen what she had experienced in the wee</B>
<P><B>hours of the morning.  She and Karen both felt that it was weird, but</B>
<P><B>gave it little thought.  After lunch, they were sitting in a waiting</B>
<P><B>room when Karen's grown children came out to get her to go to be with</B>
<P><B>their dad.  Karen waited for about 15 minutes and a nurse came in and</B>
<P><B>said Don had just died.  Karen looked at her watch and it was 2:30</B>
<P><B>p.m.</B>
