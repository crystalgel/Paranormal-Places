<p class="MsoNormal"><big>This may seem like it's not true, but it is a real
experience.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I was 10, 3 years ago,
my mom went home to Texas to visit her family.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>When she came back, she brought me a doll that she had had
since she was born.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is dressed in old
pioneer clothes and a bonnet, and its name is Pudding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If you turn her on her stomach, she says
"mommy", but she's so old that you can't understand what she is
saying.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The doll freaked me out, but I
didn't have the heart to tell my mom, so I put it in my closet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Something woke me up in the middle of the
night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I sat up and saw that the doll
was sitting on the end of my bed, smiling a creepy smile that it didn't have
before.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I screamed at the top of my
lungs, and my mom came running in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
told her what happened but she didn't believe me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She saw how freaked out I was, though, so she
moved it to my little sister's room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
next morning when I went to get my sister, she was laying in bed,
trembling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I asked what was wrong and
she said she had a dream about the doll stabbing her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She showed me her arms, and they were covered
in scratches.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I know she didn't scratch
herself because she was only almost 6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
told my mom, and she said she finally believed us because the same thing that happened
to my sister happened to her when she was little.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We threw the doll away, and nothing has
happened since.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>About 20 years ago I went to my first haunted place in my
life. I wasn't scared just currious. It is located in <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Ohio</st1:place></st1:State> near the deer creek area. The gost is
of a cathy smith, she walks down a hill in her wedding gown...the story is in
the 1800's she was on her way to her wedding in a horse and buggy and someone
spooked the horses and the carriage wrecked and killed her. To this day she
haunts the land. She walks down the hill at the accident site on certain
nights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I first met Cathy, I got a
little scared and left in a hurry, it was my forst time. I started crying on
the way home for no reason.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My aunt told
me not to cry her tears but I just couldn't help it....the next day we realized
she had come home with us. Is this possible? When I took her back home I didn't
fo to the hill we went to a cemetary I asked her where she wanted to go home
too. I got out of the car and walked straight to a grave site with a tombstone
with tne name of Cathy Smith on it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To
this date she still haunts the hill and she loves to scare people. She likes to
leave her site and go home with you and be in two places at once.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was my first real experience and I will
never<span style="">&nbsp; </span>forget it...</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Hi. I love your site. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Ok. I lived in this 100 year old house for 4 years. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>It wasn't super haunted. Just stuff happened that wasn't
fun.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>My TV would come on or shut off. My stereo would click on. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>f I was in the living room, I would hear a cup hit the
kitchen floor. I could hear it bounce around on the floor. I'm clumsy I know
what it sounds like. Then I would go into the kitchen and nothing would be
there. A few times when I was completely alone I would hear a horrible crash of
what sounded like all my dishes hitting the floor. I only ever checked once.
When I saw nothing anywhere in the house, I didn't look the second time. I was
to scared. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>My kids heard this one too. Always when I was cooking
dinner. I would hear my front door (Old and squeaky) come open then slam shut
and then someone would walk threw the house. This happened like 5 times. I
would call everyone I knew. No one came over. No one was ever there. I was
smiling and ready to greet people. No one was ever there. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Our cat would stare at the wall and get a bent out of shape
from time to time. Never would he ever enter our bedroom. I didn't like it
there either... I always felt watched and mad at. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>A few times when sitting on the couch there would be a loud
bang on the wall above me. There are no pipes in that part of the house. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>We finally got to move. I was so happy. As a little present
while my son and I were cleaning up the basement. We heard someone stomp threw
the house. This is the middle of the day. Everyone I know is at work and I had
my front door locked. I even have a picture of my son looking up at the ceiling
as it stomped by. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I love my new house. Nobody died here.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I've been reading stories on this site for years now....I
love it, and tell everyone I know about it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>here's my story.....</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>we had a cat that was mainly mine, and my daughter's.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>charlie would sleep every night with <st1:place w:st="on">erin</st1:place>, and they were terrific buddies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>well, charlie suffered a series of strokes
and had to be put down, and it was devastating to my daughter and me. both of
us heard the cat within days of her passing---scratching her neck---and my
daughter felt her weight on her bed beside her.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>the disney movie, "tarzan", was out at the time, and <st1:place w:st="on">erin</st1:place> told me that she couldn't listen to the phil
collins' song from it, "you'll be in my heart" because it reminded
her of charlie, and she'd just cry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>so,
for over a year after that, every time I heard that song, I cried, too.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>fast forward another year or so, and I was
sitting on the living room floor, watching, "Tarzan" with my youngest
son.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>it was on TV, not a DVD, so it's
not like we watched it all the time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the
phil collins song played, and I thought of charlie, but didn't cry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>seconds later, I felt the unmistakable, and
undeniable weight of a cat rubbing itself along my back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I turned, because we had two more cats by
then, thinking it was one of them. there was nothing and no one there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I just stopped cold, and knew, beyond a
shadow of a doubt, that it was charlie, coming back, on cue, to say hello and
give me a loving bump.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>instead of making
me sad, I was really happy to have her "come visit".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am one of those who so very much want to
see a ghost, but haven't yet, but I know I felt one---charlie, our beloved cat.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>i was the age of
12 /13 ,when my grandmother bought me a rocking chair out of what she said was
a yard sale.she claimed they were very glad to rid of it and she never thought
to ask why,...she brought it home and i sat it in my room with my dolls in
it.it was an antique so i was leary about anyone sitting in it.i never
experienced any weird activites in it ,but my brother at the age of 9yrs,was
sitting in the living room where he could see it and claimed he seen it rock
three times.it scared him to where he ran outside to my grandmother crying and
screaming.i was confused and my grandmother told me to keep it close and keep
my door shut.later my aunt said she went into my room to get something and she
also seen it move...i was getting mad thinking that there was something wrong
with my chair and hid it in my closet...the last person that seen it move was
my little cousin ,due to us moving to another location.she agreed to keep it in
her room where she did not stay at the time,but went in and out of there when
needed.she was doing her hair in her dresser mirror when she said she caught
glimpse of the rocker moving then to her surprise and fright,a little girl
appeared.she said she was very beautiful and in older clothing.she screamed and
ran from the room.it took her some time to calm down to tell what happened,and
there i was ready to get rid of it also.the one thing that i did find out about
the chair before giving it away was it hated men.due to my families
curiousity,my great uncle was determined to see it and experienced it sliding
away from him across the room.he was never the less very scared and left
quickly.i am glad i gave it away ,and didnt think twice,...but never had it do
anything in front of me..<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>hi. i just wanted to share a story. i moved into an older
house i bought from a couple a few years ago. the lady told me they had heard
voices in the house, but nothing else had ever happened. i moved in and after a
while, i started hearing the voices. they were like someone was in another room
with the door closed. i could hear voices, but could not make out what was
being said. later on, other things started happening. i would be asleep at
night and i would be awakend, as if someone was shaking me. several times, i
woke up to what felt like a child jumping on the bed. i have never actually
seen anything, but i have gotten up in the morning and the cushions on my
furniture will be flipped up or the toilet paper will be off the roll in the
floor. i have also heard a childs voice. i have had freinds over and they hear
the voices, and on one occasion a freind was here, when the tv just turned off.
i have talked to the couple i bought the house from, they say nothing like that
ever happened to them. they bought the house from an older lady, who was a
widow and had the house built. i have always been interested in ghosts and
ghost stories, but never experienced anything until i moved in here. i live out
in the country, and my house is across the road from an old church cemetary.
there is also supposed to be an old indian burial ground in the area. i have
hiked through the woods and neighboring properties, but haven't found anything.
i've never been scared of any of this, just more interested. i started working
a night shift about two years ago and haven't experienced anything since. i
kind of miss those experiences. i was checking out your website and thought i
would share my story.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>i would love it if you guys added to your ghost story
collection in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">iraq</st1:country-region></st1:place>.
i was deployed there in 2003-2004 at the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">baghdad</st1:City></st1:place>
international airport. when my unit was there, there were many strange goings
on that occured. first, in the hangers, there was a very dark "impending
doom" feeling, it was extremely uncomfortable to walk around alone at
night any where in the hanger or ajoining building. feeling like someone was
right behind you while walking, strange noises and creeks. a soldier had
actually commited suicide on the rooftop of that ajoining building. soldiers
were camped out in this building and it was extremely dark and dreadful, its
like death was hanging around. the whole airport area had actually been bombed
and dead iraqi bodies were collected throughout the airport area. walking
around outside anywhere at night became a dreadful experience. soldiers were
encouraged to stick together "battle buddy", because of the war and
also because of the strange feelings. many soldiers complained of many restless
nights due to feelings of overwhelming anxiety and or nightmares. i, myself
know for a fact of occurances. i woke up more than a handful of times because
some "unseen presence" was touching my hair or pulling it. this also
happend<span style="">&nbsp; </span>to another girl in my room with
me. i can not express how strange and frightening that was. also, on my b-day,
i became deathly ill and no one told me what i had came down with, i ended up
staying at a national guard unit medic station for 4 days, and while there was
very ill and having strange "hallucinations" of ghosts and strange
vibes, but wasnt on any medicine that would induce any kind of hallucination.
something woulld wake me up repeatedly and i was by myself, while walking to the
toilet "port-o-potty" outside, feeling like someone was right next to
me, in the building where i was sleeping there would be drafts of cold air and
no window near by me. other soldiers told many stories of different things,
ranging from noises to cold spots, to<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>feeling uneasy,hearing un-human noises like growling with no type of
animal present, some one walking behind them to turn around and see nothing and
feeling like there was something watching you. all in all this has been the
most haunted place ive been. considering the history and circumstances, i can
understand why. i wanted to share this with you. hopefully you will post it. im
sure your readers will be interested. </big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">&nbsp;</span>am a 19 year old boy
living with my family in an apartment. well its all rented and we been stayin
here just for about 6 years now. its a small apartment, 3 bedrooms a hall,
kitchin and dinin room. everythin was jus normal at the begning we were pretty
much happy about it all.It started from the time i got committed, was truely in
love me and my better half talked for hours on the phone even during the night.
and then one night it just so happened tht i was really depressed about
something and i was tellin her how lonely i was, i was lyin face down on ma bed
talkin to her on the phone, and then suddenly i felt some1 sittin beside me and
i jus could see a dark form when i turned ma head!! it was late in night so the
lights were turned off, i tried ta get up. i couldnt, whatever it was, it had a
hand on ma back pressin me back on the bed. i tried ta call mom or dad, but the
words simply couldnt come out. my girl, she was screamin on the other side,
somethin about me mumblin things! and then i tried ta get up again with all my
force, nd this time the dark form let go and sat straight up! i was really
really cold!! i turned the lights on immediately but found no1 in the room!!
mom, dad never belived anything. BUT it was not long when they decided to
belive me,WE have a cellar parkin lot, which is like a basement to the
appartment, i was with ma dad nd we were tryin ta get the car out!! suddenly
dad stopped and asked if i said somethin, i denied, then we both heard it!! it
was somethin like a raspin kind of a voice. it was weird, really really weird!!
we looked around but there was no1!! we started backin away and then some1
screamed right in our ears, " dont u dare leave me alone" ... then it
became so cold!! nd the cold swept by and then it was all back to normal!.. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>we never tried sharin this wid anyone! thought they might
think we are jus insane. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>nd after that these things started occurin frequently,
specially in my room, always kept hearing someone bangin on the bathroom door,
but every time i opened it, it was all empty inside!!</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>and then the most amazin thing happened, that made me
respect the "shadow"[ thts what i started calling it]. i was driving
all alone that night, really bored, and sleepy, nd i din know i just fell asleep
as soon as i opened my eyes i saw a truck speedin right at me! i had no time to
react! but i had a feelin tht some1 placed a cold hand upon mine on the steerin
wheel, and turned the car, i missed the truck by inches, ma heart was hammerin
against ma chest, and then again the cold feeling crept over, nd then the
whisper " dont worry, your fine" i turned immidiately to see what jus
whispered and again, there was nothing!. i smiled to myself and the cold feelin
was immidiately turned all warm and comfy!! </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>this my story,
i know theres some1 watching over me! i don kno who it is, u know?? i hated the
feeling initially, but then when i welcomed it found everythin in ma life goin
jus fine!! i think i finally found a friend who i can trust to be there for me
when i need him! </big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I was looking through your archives of places in PA that
have hauntings, and the only post on <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Mount</st1:PlaceType>
 <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Holly</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Springs</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>
came to mind. Maybe what I heard, felt, and even saw is related....but I doubt
it. Let me start at the beginning:</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>On June 9th 2007, I was staying the night with my girlfriend
right off the main road of <st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">North
  Baltimore Ave.</st1:address></st1:Street> and Butler St. Up on the top of the
hill on <st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">Butler St.</st1:address></st1:Street>
is a medium size <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Methodist</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Church</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> that my little
brother had Cub Scout meetings at. Behind the church is a small park merging
with a wooded area. This wooded area is in the process of being torn down for a
housing development. At about 1:45ish on the morning of June 10th we decided to
go for a walk up to the park and woods. We had never heard of any kind of
activity aside from daily bikers, and walkers occasionally losing bearings on
the series of winding paths. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>When we got to the church we decided to go into the woods,
my girlfriend had her phone and watch, I had a knife, and a watch. When we
walked into the woods within moments of us entering the woods the light<span style="">&nbsp; </span>from the street lamps in the park suddenly
vanished and everything was pitch black dark. But not daunted by it, we kept
walking and after about 5 uneasy minutes I paused and told her"hold,
quite", I heard a distinct sound of something moving around in the brush,
and it wasn't in one place, for a bout 30 seconds while I was listening it
would change from in front of us, to the left or right, and at one point from
above. My girlfriend turned on the light of her phone and it wasn't working
correctly. The light was unusually dull and flickered every few moments. At
this point we still kept walking until we began to hear a dim and almost
distant voice, and we knew no one else was there, no cars had been in the
parking lot fr the church or the park, and no construction was being done at
night. Once we reached nearer the construction sight( I think) we saw a blueish
light to the left of our position. I have always been unable to catch my
bearings with the compass on my watch. For some reason the magnetic field
doesn't work properly in those woods. I think we where facing South East
meaning the light came from the North East. But at the point of the light we
just turned around and ran. The moment we got to the tree line the lights for
the park reappeared. We kept running and when we got onto the Church grounds,
my girlfriend's phone got a message from her calendar reminding her with only
two words: "Hell's Yes" This was at about 2:30AM. We then went home
and didn't talk about it till about a week later. We returned to that park
several months later with a very similar experience, but more forceful. I think
whatever haunts or occupies the woods, is angered by the housing development that's
tearing it down.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>We have had so much going on I don't know where to
begin.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Several years ago our family
noticed strange happenings but were so far apart we would let it go.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Keys being misplaced and than turning up
where we first looked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Seeing a mist
over the top of the refrigerator, being tapped on the shoulder, the feeling of
being watched and of course the footsteps.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>2006 we renovated our entire home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is when things got really
noticable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were all hearing our names
called.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The kitchen cabinets were
slamming but most of the time when our backs were to them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I got<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>touched on my head and my back.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Computers turned on by themselves.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We started looking back at the house when we would leave to see if there
was any movement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One night we came home
and all the lights in the basement were on when we came home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One night my husband came home ( noone was
home) and he heard all this noise upstairs, like the t.v. was<span style="">&nbsp; </span>blaring with some kind of game show (alot of
voices) when he hit the foyer, everything went silent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was very upset.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He swears he saw a civil war man on our deck,
but I think he was in the house because he headed towards the cabinet or pantry
that was slamming.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My children and I saw
an orb bigger than a softball come out of the pantry went across the top of my
slider and it was gone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were all
downstairs watching television when we heard running in the hallway, of course
no one was there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was sitting at the
kithen table about 2:00 a.m. when all of sudden it got really cold and it felt
like someone was standing over me scowling at me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It<span style="">&nbsp; </span>did
not feel good.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My husband was sitting at
the table and he felt a pounding on the table and the table vibrated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Another time I was sitting at the table and
out of the corner of my eye I caught a shadow go under the table so I thought
it was my dog, when I looked nothing was there.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Then it sounded like something was being dropped down the vent next to
the slider.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>That christmas the tree was next to the computer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am on the computer about 3:00 in the
morning when the tree started shaking.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was unbelievable. I have been keeping a log all the way up to this
month.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have had so much happen and
are still having things happen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Some
time may go by, but it happens again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
have all seen shadow people.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I can hear
a knocking that no one else can hear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
know that we have something going on in this home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It could be the land for the civil war came
through here, plus I have spoken to others in the area who have also had
paranormal activity happen to them as well.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>My parents' house in <st1:City w:st="on">Stratford</st1:City>
upon <st1:place w:st="on">Avon</st1:place> is modern, built in the 1960s and as
far as I know nothing stood on the site of the house previously. Nevertheless,
several of us have seen strange things there. The living room on the ground
floor is at a right angle to the hallway which leads to the front door, and
from one of the armchairs you can see up the stairs which come down onto the
hall. Several times my parents and I have seen a figure come down the stairs and
turn the corner towards the door. You see it only just out of the corner of
your eye, but once I saw enough to have a sense of a flurry of skirts as the
figure turns. When my brother and I were little my parents would think that
we'd got out of bed and come downstairs and get up to tell us off only to
realise that there was nothing there. Our old neighbours (the house is
semi-detached) got very angry with us once and wrote a long letter complaining
of banging around in the early hours of the morning and particularly of the
sound of the French windows being opened and shut repeatedly when in fact we
had all been soundly asleep. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>One time towards Christmas when my mother had hung all of
the Christmas cards on streamers against the wall I saw them all billow out
into the room from the wall though there was no breeze and nothing else moved.
Our cat would sometimes watch something tracing the same path down the stairs
to the hall, though there was nothing to be seen. The only time I was actually
frightened was one New Year's Eve when I was up in bedroom - I must have been
about twelve - and with everyone downstairs talking I suddenly heard footsteps
outside my bedroom scuffing the carpet. That made me scream and my dad rushed
upstairs and said 'Where was it?' These events seem to have got fewer and
further between as time passes and I think it's years since anyone has seen or
felt anything now.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>The other times that I believe that I have seen ghosts it
has been very much on the model of the earlier sightings at home, a shape out
of the corner of your eye which you take to be a figure and only realise after
it has gone could not possibly be. One night I was in the main corridor of my
school, a big nineteenth century building, and quite alone, when I felt like a
boy had walked past me. I had a flash of a dark jacket and white collar as he
went past, and after a fraction of a second I turned round because I hadn't
seen anyone come towards me and it's a long corridor. There was no one there. I
even hurried back up the corridor because the only way for him not to be there
would've been to go up a wide wooden - and very noisy - staircase off to one
side - which in any case was for masters only - and there was no one there
either.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>My mother and I once saw a ghost together when we were
visiting a country house - we were in the stableyard going towards one of the
outbuildings and I saw a woman in a white dress go into the building before us.
When we went through the door ourselves my mother said, 'Where is she?' because
there was no one else there. My father and brother hadn't seen anything.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>The only other time I have been frightened by something
ghostlike was when I was staying at an old house in <st1:place w:st="on">Yorkshire</st1:place>.
I had gone up to bed at about one in the morning and couldn't sleep, so I was
reading a book of cartoons that was on the bedside table. The reading light was
on, and as I was in the middle of reading I felt all of a sudden absolutely
terrified and unable to move. I felt like the worst thing in the world was
standing behind me and I daren't move. I've no idea how long the feeling
lasted, it felt like ages but could have been only half a minute, before just
as suddenly it disappeared and everything felt fine again. Some years later I
heard that behind the panelling of this room the owners had discovered a
disused staircase leading to the small attic room known as 'The Mad Woman's
Room' -<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the precise story behind is a
mystery, but it was a family secret some time before the nineteenth century,
and being told to Charlotte Bronte on a visit is believed to have inspired the
fate of Rochester's wife in Jane Eyre. I'm not sure though that the horrific
almost evil feeling I had could have anything to do what sounds like a very
tragic story.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Two Men and a Lady</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By: C03239@Cerner.com</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>This true story took place in the early 1970s over a three
or four year period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I was five
years old my mother and father purchased their first house. I remember helping
them move (as much as a five year old can). I was sent to our new basement to perform
some medial task. When I went down there I saw a shadowy silhouette of a man
walk along the wall opposite of the windows. He seemed to have what would be
his back to the wall and acted as if he was afraid of me. At the time I was not
afraid but bewildered. I told my mother of this, and it was dismissed as a
childs imagination.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Some time later my great-grandfather was visiting us and I
had to sleep on the floor in my sleeping bag. I was awakened that night by a
loud crash seemingly coming from our kitchen. As I lay there in the middle of
the night I saw the silhouette of a man walk down the hallway passing my open
door going towards my infant sister&#8217;s room. The silhouette was illuminated in
that it looked like the static you used to see on old televisions that were on
an open channel. It was translucent but very defined in the darkness. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>On another occasion I saw the same type of silhouette walk
the same way only this time it was the figure of a women in an old-time type of
bell dress. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>The last time I saw one of these things I was awakened by
the male figure. He was in my room and walking towards me. Only when he got to
a certain point he started over from the same place as if there was a glitch in
time. this went on for many minutes and then he was gone. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>It would be easy to dismiss these events as the overactive
imagination of a child, but as my sightings diminished my sister who was now
about five began to tell my mother of the same types of sightings. I remember
her asking my Mom if she could have a Halloween costume like the dress with
lights that the lady who comes into her room at night wears. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I don't know if it has anything to do with the sightings but
when I got older my Mother told me that they got a good deal on the house. It
seems that the former owner was a low-level member of organized crime. He
turned up missing and the bank foreclosed on the house. At approximately the
same time my parents closed on the house his body was found in the trunk of a
car. Also our neighbors said there was a young man living there that was openly
involved in the occult. He stayed in the bedroom that became mine.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Anyway, I can't prove this story. I know it happened just
the way I said it did. I see similar stories and many of them are about
children seeing the same types of things. Maybe children have the ability to
see things adults can't. I apparently lost the ability to see them while my
little sister continued to see them for a few more years. Who knows maybe you
could have these things in your house right now.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Ghost Skeptic</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By: tawonda2@yahoo.com</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I'm sharing this story with you with the disclaimer that I
am a ghost skeptic -- that I can find logical explanations for most
"ghosty" phenomena described by others. But since this story is from
my significant other;-)...well, I've got to honor that!</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>My dad, Henry, died about 10 years ago, after falling ill at
home with what turned out to be an aortic aneurysm -- he was rushed to the
hospital but died a few hours later when the aneurysm burst. My partner and I
rotate between her home and my home, which used to be my parents' retirement
cottage.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>A couple of years ago, after our relationship became
serious, my partner confided to me that she could feel what she described as a
friendly but eerie presence in our garage. She noted that our dogs and cat,
while not at all afraid of the garage -- the opposite, actually -- nonetheless
stayed out of certain parts of the garage, as if they were walking around
something.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She also recounted going into
the garage when I was at work to find the old radio on inside, on a local
talk-radio AM station. (We never touch the radio, but it's still plugged into
an outlet on Dad's work table.) This unnerved her so that she found herself
talking to "Hank," telling him, "You've got to stop that, Hank
-- you're scaring me!"</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>When she told me this story, I told her about a similar
incident, before I'd known her, when I'd come home one day for lunch to find
the old radio on in the garage. This had unnerved me too, but I chalked it up
to a mouse accidently switching the radio on while scuttling around the
workshop, or some other equally non-otherworldly explanation. I'd also told her
that, when he was alive, my dad's garage was his "man cave" -- he
wasn't allowed to smoke in the house, so he'd sit out in one of the bays with a
Swisher Sweet, watching the neighborhood activity; or he'd be busy tinkering in
his workshop area.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Other than my one radio incident I honestly do not sense
that my father is present in the garage -- I don't have the hair-standing-on-end
sensation, the feeling of coldness or of being watched, or anything like that.
I've never had another radio incident. Every once in awhile I'll come upon one
of his old Swisher Sweet cigarillo holders on the lawn...keep in mind, he smoked
a lot, so it's not unreasonable that a non-biodegradable plastic thingmabob
like that will surface once in a while.;-) But my partner feels
"Hank" in the garage most of the time, as a protective presence who
takes a real interest in any project she's working on in there. And she'll even
talk to him from time to time. I kid her that "Hank" likes her
because she's like the son-in-law he never had when he was alive.;-)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But she won't let him listen to Rush Limbaugh,
his favorite show, on the old radio. "I like you, Hank," she tells
him," but not THAT much."<span style="">&nbsp; </span></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I was at my friend Jennifer's house and her house was built
in the late 1800's-early 1900's or so. In the day, everything's<span style="">&nbsp; </span>normal, but at night it just seems a little
off.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Her houses layout is like, the backdoor is used as a front
door. You go through the backdoor and your in the sunroom. Theres a doorway
directly to your right, and a few feet to your left is another door that goes
into the downstairs barthoom that Jen's stepdad put in a few years back. The
bathroom has 2 doorways, almost like a hallway with a toilet and a shower. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>You go through there from the sunroom and you end up in
their familyroom. If you go to the door that was to your right, your in the
kitchen. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>When your in the kitchen you walk past the fridge about 4
feet and theres 2 door ways, one straigh ahead and one to the left going to the
pantry. In the pantry there's a 'secret' stair case that lead up to the
upstairs bathroom. If you go straight you end up in the dining room. When your
in the dining room, theres two ways to get to the main staircase. To the left
is the familyroom connected to the bathroom, straight ahead is the second
family room. Either way you go through, you either go right or left in
whichever room and you end up at the main staircase. The main staircase is next
to a massive stained glass window. about 15 feet high and 8 feet wide. It goes
up to just about below the ceiling. There are 3 landings. One close to the bottom,
on close to the top, and one at the top. When you go up you can go straight
into jens room or turn left and go into her parents room. If you go straight
about 7 feet right before jens room, you can go into the second hallway, theres
a closet there which is under the attic stairs. Turn right and continue down
the hallway about 4 feet and infont of you in the bathroom that has two
doorways :]. Stand there and turn left and look left and theres the attic
stairs with the door closed and locked because of bats. Go straight past the
staircase and your in Jessica's room (Jen's older sister).</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Thats the layout. The attic upstairs is finished btw. theres
still bats and stuff though.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Okay, so eveyrthing is normal during the day like i said. It
starts getting eerie at night. Like, i'll go downstairs alone at night but i
dont stay for long. I've never had a self-concious problem with people watching
me or like feeling like their watching me through a window or somthing, but in
her house i feel like somthings watching me from the cieling. NOT a window. The
kitchen and sunroom is the only place i feel... safe in. Like, not watched.
Probably because the sunroom was an addition to the house? Anyway.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>One night i slept over at jen's and around 2 AM the door
that i made sure was completly shut (habit :P) suddenly propped open and
creaked as it always did. my feet were uncovered at the time and i felt
somthing brush up aganst them like somthing silky and free. I turned the map on
and nothing was there, Jen asleep the whole time.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Another thing that creeps me out is i hear creepy noises
coming from the attic around 3 AM. Like somthing thumping, and i dont think
bats wear heavy working boots.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Another thing is (i dont know if they where lying about this
or not) but Jessica said she and her mom once say a young girl walk down the
hall and top at the second landing going down, and looked out the window and
sat there facing the street, like she was waiting for somthing or somone. I
havent witnessed this girl but i do hear a young girl talking when the wind
blows aganst the house. Once, i thought i heard somone say "oh, your
home!" and i turned to jen and asked her what? she said she didnt say
anything.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I know the description of the house wasnt really needed but
you wouldnt really understand it if i just started rambling on about things.
Thanks<span style="">&nbsp; </span>for reading.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>P.S. Where the girl was suposidly seen looking at the
window, when Jen's stepdad was making repairs to the floor he foudn a half of a
heart locket jammed in the floorboards. He still cant get it out so he just
made the repairs and left it as is.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Interesting Fact: George Bush's Grandmother lived in the
house and i think was the original owner.</big></p>

when she became too loud or rowdy like you would any young person during teen
years.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Strangely enough, a underpass was constructed for cars and
students at <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Fresno</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">City</st1:PlaceType> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">College</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>
after 2 students were killed by trains while crossing the tracks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A male student was walking to his car while
listening to music with earphones and not paying attention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The other was the last of several cars
friends racing each other one behind the other to beat the train across the

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>2) While visiting a cousin and husband in Hiawatha, Ks a few
years ago we visited his empty 2 story birthplace home in the country.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He related stories of a family gathering
where several adults were at the dinning room table playing a game after
dinner. His uncle was sitting near by in a easy chair. smoking a cigar when the
rocking chair in the middle of the room began creaking and rocking back and
forth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The surprised uncle opened his
mouth and the cigar fell to the floor causing laughter among those present.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>3) Also mentioned was that the house was frequently rented

presently visiting the house frequently to make sure it was not used by

windows, kitchen cubbards, drawers were close each time he left.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon returning the next day, there was
usually an upstairs door ajar and kitchen cabinet doors and drawers ajar. His
wife remarked, I wonder if it's your recently departed mother.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I am serving in the US Air Force in <st1:State w:st="on">California</st1:State>
but my family lives in <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Az.</st1:place></st1:State>
I tried to post this Jerome Hotel Experience but the Site wouldnt work so i
thought i would paste it for you to read. So here it is: </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>On my Girlfriends 21st Birthday my mom set up a night in the
<st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Jerome</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Hotel</st1:PlaceName></st1:place> for my mom/my gf and myself. She
booked 2 rooms...31 and 33. Before we left i had heard the place was haunted
but not much more. We arrived in the hotel and from the beginning the air
inside was very thick and harsh. When we got into our rooms they seemed
pleasant and nice. I was laying in my room when a strong scent of Flower
Perfume came across me. My mom and gf were getting ready but all doors were closed
and they didnt have anything that came close to what the scent was. Well I
moved into my moms room and they went outside to smoke. Inside the bathroom it
sounded like someone was scuffing their shoe in the bathroom and than the
Pulley system that used to give medicine was heard in there as well. Come to
find out that system had been removed years ago so again i went hmmm.... They
came back and i explained what happened and they made jokes as usual. When they
started to make jokes something began to touch my arm. Something very cold and
it wasnt threatening but it was moving up and down. My mom came over and said
she felt a cold spot that continued to move and thats when i said DINNER TIME
WOO! We can back and my gf wanted to take pics with her camera on a tri-pod so
dust wouldn't get kicked around. Well what we found were 3 orbs constantly
around me and nobody else. The final phenomena was outside we heard what
sounded like a shovel being dragged across the cement. When i went to look
there wasn't anyone out there and come to find out my mom and i were the only
ones to hear it..My gf did not hear it on all 3 of the occasions it happened.
This place is definately haunted. Stay there and ask for rooms 31/33. It has a
great old feel and the elevator is worth the stay even if you don't experience
what i did.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>That was fun....As for my home experience. We moved into
this house when i was 15 years old. The first night there i saw a man and a
women standing in my doorway holding hands than walk away. I figured im just
seeing things right? Wrong... My Next experience is I was in bed (top bunk only
one in room) and my head and pillow started lifting off the mattress..i said
stop it and it stopped...Talked to my mom about what was going on and I wasnt
the only one experiencing things. My mom heard stuff dropping in the bathroom
and breaking but when she went to investigate there wasnt anything. Her closet
light would turn on for no reason. I would turn it off when she wasnt home and
as i was walking out it would turn back on. My Door would slam shut for no
reason and TV would turn itself off and on continuously when i was in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Iraq</st1:place></st1:country-region>. My
Brother has seen someone come up and down the steps and my gf has heard little
girls playing in my moms office but when she goes in there isnt anyone inside.
The creepiest thing i've experienced is I was up on the computer and at about 3
am (dead time i know) it sounded as if a train was going right through my
living room and a little boy was being choked. We have trains that go by the
house but they are NEVER that loud and the fact it sounded like a lil boy was
being strangled freaked me out. 2 weeks later my mom was up with me and i told
her to mute the tv and this time again loud as hell and instead of a boy it was
a lil girl.......This phenomena happens in spurts. When i moved out of the
house it died down but in my apartment i saw a black shadow looking around the
corner in my apartment. my roommate woke me up one night asking if i was in the
hallway because he had just seen a man walk down the hallway into my room. I
know im haunted. Ever since i was a little kid living in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">chicago</st1:City></st1:place> with my grandparents during summers i
would see and hear things. The stuff just started in my house again. My mom was
asleep and someone turned on her overhead light that can only be turned on by a
remote contr ol that was in her dresser drawer and than she said it sounded
like someone opened the front door. Freaked out she ran downstairs but the door
was locked...... Also i lost my remote control for my tv/cable box for almost a
year...when i asked my mom to get me a new one finally the new one turned
up....It was found on top of her bed covers in her room...she came in and asked
if it was mine and when i used it to turn on my tv...it was it....and that was
the only controller that worked for my tv.....Thought i'd share this with
you.... My brother/mom and I get weird feelings when something isnt right in
the house. I tend to see a lot of things that many others dont along with
hearing things as i said with the jerome hotel story. I hope you believe my
storys because I always love to hear others 1st hand experiences. </big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Strange Night</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By: rjm999@peoplepc.com</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Several months ago I had an experience while I was working.
I work as a courier at night and as part of my job I enter one of the local
businesses in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Tombstone</st1:City>, <st1:State w:st="on">AZ</st1:State></st1:place> near the old Bird Cage Theatre. Many
times after entering the dark building I would smell a very flowery perfume
like odor just inside the door. I never thought much of it, thinking it was
probably an air freshener or flowers or such, even though I would only smell it
once every week or two. Then one day I recalled a tv show I'd seen about the
Bird Cage Theatre's ghosts where they'd mentioned smelling a flowery perfume
backstage from one of the dance hall girls or actresses. I decided next time I
smelled it, I would take a minute and track down it's source. Well, not many
days later I entered the building, and there was that odor again. Only at the
front door. That made it very easy for me to go over that area very carefully
looking for any air freshener, or anything that could be responsible for the
odor. Nothing. The odor was strongest right at the door, and there was nothing
physically present that could have caused the odor. I kind of smiled to myself
knowing what that meant. I had to go to the rear of the building before I
exited the front door again, but as I left I noticed the odor had vanished
except for just a slight hint where only a moment before it was very strong. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Well, it's been months now and the odor hasn't returned.
Last night something new occurred that freaked me out. At the time the original
incident happened I had a lot of personal problems in my life and kind of put
the incident behind me. It's been only recently that I've appreciated what
happened and only within the last couple weeks that I even told others about my
experience. As I approached the business last night I noticed the manager was
inside working late. I thought this would be a good time to tell her about it
as it is very rare that she works late enough to be there when I come in. I got
to the front door, put the key in the lock, opened the door and stepped in. But
as I went to pull the key out of the lock it wouldn't budge. I tried turning it
every which way to pull it loose with no success. Then it occurred to me,
"Could the spirit be telling me not to tell of my experience with her
?" I began to wonder if spirits can read the mind and thoughts of others.
I even thought, "Okay, I won't tell her, is that what you want?".
Nothing different. "Do you want me to tell her?" Nothing different.
All this time I was telling the manager, "I can't get my key out of the
lock." After about five minutes of me trying to loosen it and getting
nowhere, the manager comes over and pulls the key out as easily as a knife
through hot butter! I stood aghast with my mouth wide open as I witness this. I
then told her of my past incident, and how strange it was that the key, which
I'd never had any trouble with in the past, would do this now. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>As I left the building I feared I may have angered the
spirit somehow and she was letting me know. Then I started thinking if the
spirit really wanted to cause me problems she cold have done it the night
before when the manager wasn't there to help me. After a few hours at home it
hit me how funny I must have looked trying to pull that key out and the
expression on my face when the manager did so easily. So I am hoping the spirit
was simply having fun with me. But I still wonder if spirits can read the thoughts
of the living or put thoughts into your mind? Seems like I'd heard something
about that on one of the ghost tv shows. I would appreciate your thoughts and
comments on this. I will have to return to this dark building alone every
weeknight as part of my job and would like to better understand how to deal
with this spirit.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I did not experience this myself, it happened to my mother a
couple months ago and she told me about it after it happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What happened was a couple of moths ago my
mom was preparing for a party in our kitchen at about 9:30 pm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Me and my brother, who was about 11 at the
time were both at the house at the time.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I was upstairs and he was in the living room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My mom told me that she was washing dishes
and that she looked up at the window in front of her and she saw someone walk
by the hallway behind her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
immediately thought that it was me because of how tall the person was, she she
called my name and told me to do something for her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After a couple of minutes she came to look
for my brother to ask where i had went.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He looked at her like she was crazy and told her that i hadn't been
downstairs for about an hour.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She called
me down noticeably scared because she thought someone was in the house, but we
could not find anyone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This happened
once more to my mother, but more noticeable.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She was washing clothes and had to walk through the kitchen and saw
someone poke their head out from behind the counter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She of course thought that it was either me
or my brother, but when she checked she found no one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She called me immediately and told me what
had happened and now we believe that a ghost is i the house, but it doesn't
show itself regularly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Two other things
have happened since then.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One happened a
couple months after that,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>me and my
brother had a friend over and he had gone to the bathroom on the second story
of our house, no one was up their at the time but when he came down he said
that he had seen two red eyes down the hall near my parents room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He immediately ran downstairs and we told him
about my mothers experiences.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The other
thing that happens more frequently now is that our dog starts to growl at
something in the hallway.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She sleeps in
our parents room and sometimes she will get up and walk around the room and
then she will stop in the doorway and growl at something in the hallway, but
when we turn on the light there will be nothing their.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has been a couple of months since anything
worth reporting has happened, but we believe that it is a friendly ghost and
nothing harmful will come of it.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>The Butterfly Ghost</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By: pchirichiello@colbent.com</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I have been a huge fan of this site and here is my story. I
always believed there is a fine line between the paranormal and coincidence. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>My mother died suddenly in the spring of 2005. Shortly after
that my second child was born. I always wondered if she could see my daughter.
I always asked for a sign. A little while later while vacationing, my whole
family was swimming in a lake. A very large yellow butterfly flew and sat on my
beach chair. I walked towards and joked to my wife that maybe it was my mother
watching her grandkids play.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As I
approached the butterfly it made no attempts to move. In fact I stuck out my
hand and it crawled on. I sat on the beach chair for about 15 minutes with this
butterfly on my hand while it just looked out at my kids in the water. It
eventually flew away. I chalked that up as coincidence until later that night.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>My sister called me. She&#8217;s a big believer in the supernatural.
She called to tell me she got engaged. As we talked and I got details I wanted
to tell her about the butterfly. But before I did I asked her a question. I
asked her if she noticed anything strange before she was asked to be married
(she was proposed to on a beach). She said no but then paused and said
&#8220;actually there was a large yellow butterfly that followed us the entire walk
we had.&#8221; I told her my story and we are convinced it was our mother in some
form.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">&nbsp;</span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>well,i don't know where to start but um, i had some
experiences in the house i still live in now.(22 yrs) i am<span style="">&nbsp; </span>now 24 yrs old.I still dont understand why it
happens.I cant really remember the first time it started.but i was about 12 yrs
old.it was late at night around 1:30 am. and i always slept on the couch. one
night i woke up to the sounds of footsteps running around the house.I was so
scared i couldnt move. i just prayed to god for it to be over.well i ended up
passing out to sleep from how scared i was.a couple weeks later,same time at
night i was asleep.and my feet were hanging over the arm rest of the sofa.All
the sudden i felt a hand grabbing my ankle and with my eyes still shut i was
thinking(what the hell is that) i opened my eyes to look and my leg dropped
from the air as if someone let it go.I was SOO scared i slept in a ball the
rest of the night.Than some weeks passed. another late night had come.And i had
waken up to a sound of someone dragging something heavy towards the kicthen from
the hallway.Thinking it was my brother i had jumped up to scare him once the
sound was right around the wall from me but when i looked,nothing. once again i
passed out with fear.than things started to get real serious.One night,around
8-10 pm.I was in the living room waching tv thats next to the back door to the
backyard.And we had those blinds that open side ways when you pull the
string.Well half of them were missing so we used a bed sheet to cover that
section.But it only covered half ways.Well the light from the tv was hitting
the ground where the sheet didnt cover.And the blinds were a lil open so you
can see into the backyard which was real dark.Than all the sudden i saw a man
in all black walking towards the side as if going towards the door.than it
stopped were the tv light was hitting.I could see its black feet.like tabi
shoes.(ninja boots)So i got up still looking at them and reached for the sheet
and pulled it and the feet just vanished.My heart STOPPED!! i froze unable to
move.Some time had passed.like 2 yrs.And i got home late one night with my mom
and we were at the door knocking.No one got up.The light from the kichen was on
and it kinda gave light to the hall.well as we nocked a lil harder.someone was
leaning over the window inside.And as well had those blinds with a few missing
on the end.I looked but saw it was all black.Thinking it was my bro i started
cursing at him to open the door.My mom got the keys out and started opening the
door.right before we rushed in the shadow was still there.I ran in and just
felt something run right threw me towards the kichen.It even blew my long
sleeve shirt open.I stopped and didnt know what to think.One day mid afternoon,
i was alone reading a book and i heard the bathroom door shut HARD.I got up to
look but it was open.All the doors were open. since it wasnt night time i wasnt
as scared.But that night,alone , i just got done washing my hands and i started
down the hall when i felt something over my shoulder.I turned slowly and saw a
black hand reaching up behind me and when i turned real fast all the way it
ducked down and vanished.I stuck against the wall unable to move for like 10
min.Than ran outside till someone got home.This was when i nearly had a heart
attack.One night i was wating for my uncle to get home because he is a truck
driver.I was in the small living room on the couch(where my leg was grabbed)
and laying down facing the door.Theres two windows next to the entrance
door.well i had the feeling i was being watched.It was so strong.Seemed like everything
got quiet.Than all the sudden a black shadow darted which really looked like it
was floating across the window as if it was coming to get me.I had jumped up so
fast towards the window when i saw it, when i got there i felt face to face
with something so powerful.It passed by so fast but yet saw everything.It
looked like a skeleton.I saw the skull it looked so angry and had like
spikes,or spicky hair.and it looked like it had a ripped sleeveless shirt. i
saw the bony skeleton arms and seemed like it had short horns on its shouders.I
saw the the jaws and everything. but when it all happened that very moment my
heart REALLY did stop.I was about to faint cuz i tried to run but my legs felt
like they had fallen asleep.And my left arm went completly numb.Its really hard
to explain that very moment but i can still see it in my head.people think i
was just imagining it but i saw it as i was looking at my self in the
mirror.That could be the reason i have a heart problem today because it scared
me almost to death.Literally! When i have company come over,they always tell me
they feel like there gonna see someone walk by the back door.And they dont feel
right sleeping at night here as if there bieng watched.Footsteps i do hear
alot.Loud and clear.Every now and than the man shows up.But usually where i
dont see him.My sister had a serious encounter with him twice.Here at home and
when she had her own place.She woke up one night to someone on top of her
choking her.But she couldnt see anyone.when it stopped,she screamed for my mom
real loud.She was real scared.She didnt sleep alone for months.somtimes i know
hes here,but he dosent make a move.I sometimes dare it to but than i feel like
i cant handle it.Its just to strong and powerful.People dont believe ghost exist
but they really do.Hard to believe,but they do.But a long time ago,my sisters
played the ouija board here and thats when things changed.But who really
knows.I dont know why it got me more than my other fam members.Well got to much
to share.But i'll be back .And if anyone had this same problem.Please share.I
dont understand why this happens.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>The House I Grew Up In</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By: ahersey3@cox.net</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I grew up in a house in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Somerville</st1:City>, <st1:State w:st="on">MA</st1:State></st1:place>
that had something &#8220;living&#8221; on the third floor.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The third floor is where the bedrooms were, attic and a crawl
space.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The crawl space was in my sisters
closet and in the 14 years I lived there I never once went in to see what was
in there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Just being in my sisters
closet was scary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We would play hide and
seek in the house and hiding in my sisters closet never lasted long.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whenever I was in there I always felt like
something was up there waiting.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Being on the third floor was odd, it was like a sound proof
area.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All sound from outside or downstairs
never seemed to penetrate to the third floor no matter how loud.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We always got an uneasy feeling being up
there, especially alone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Everyone in the
family has had an experience with the shadow as we now call it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I go back to <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Somerville</st1:place></st1:City> to visit my sister and pass by the
house I find myself being unable to NOT stare in fear up to my parents old
window.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>It&#8217;s strange because it never tried to harm anyone and yet
I&#8217;m still terrified of that place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
father saw it walking around my room late one night and he followed it into my
sister&#8217;s closet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One night I was
upstairs doing homework, I was 13 I think.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Then I got this cold uneasy feeling and I was frozen in place with
fear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I kept telling myself &#8220;GET UP!!!!
RUN!!!!&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I sat there for a few minutes
then bolted down the hall and stopped at the stairs and looked back and saw it
in my doorway.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was a shadow looking
thing with red eyes and it started coming down the hall towards me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I bolted downstairs and never told my family
about it until a few years ago.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That&#8217;s
when we all started talking about our experiences.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had always been uneasy up there but that
was the first time I ever felt I was in danger.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We moved to <st1:City w:st="on">Phoenix</st1:City> about a year or two
later but even now, 20 years later I can&#8217;t pass in front of that house without
being afraid, when I go back to <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Boston</st1:City></st1:place>
.</big></p>

husband and grandma have heard this. Also I have a few family members that
attend that church but they kinda creep me out so I stay away. When I went last
time a week ago I was taking pics and stuff and I heard meowing but saw nothing
but this kitty poped outta no where so fearing some nasty kids may harm the
kitty I took this cat home . I just home it brought nothing back with me haha.
In my home " I live in cartersville" </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>im right at the indian mounds. My house/land here has to be
cursed also in 2002 the previous owner of my home was found dead in my living
room floor he was found a week after his death " thanks good for new
flooring". Anywho we had no clue of this till 1 year after we bought the
home. Anywho my daughters room now cause she's a new baby we never used this
room there was no need for it but we would shut the door and 2 sec later it was
open again. So I would shut it and lock the door and no more than 2 sec later
its open again. I we pretty much gave up lol also at night you can hear foot
steps in the hallway/stairs. Everyone who has lived here has had the worst of
bad luck . I thought it was just us but nope all of our neibors too. I make
jokes telling my husband what the etowah indians must not like me here cause my
dads damn near full blood cherokee somehow I was not blessed with his genes
lol. Anywho 1 owner dies in house owner 2 losed everything he owned and then us
we never had any reall bad things happen till we moved here in 1 year I now
have 3 urns due to deaths an its just been bad luck one after another but our
surounding neibors said everything was good with them till they moved here. I
really think the lands cursed we have tried everything I think somes helped but
only a little I keep gargoyles on my house now lol... </big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By: badsushicannon@yahoo.com </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>It is my personal testimony, that this location is indeed</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Haunted by thing or things of a foul nature.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is a current resident living there, who
I have made no attempt to contact as I avoid even looking at this House </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>whenever possible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
lived there with my brother and my niece for around a year I suppose, and was
often to spend the night alone there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>On many occasions in the bathroom I could hear scratching
from the closet door, only to find no evidence of Mice or other rodents in the
closet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Infact we put</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>a mouse trap down in the closet with plenty of food, the
food went untouched and the trap un-sprung.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>A light covering outside detached from its base and nearly
struck my 2 year old niece in the head, and while this could be natural it has
always been odd to us </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>how far the covering landed from the light (Almost 3 feet).</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">&nbsp;</span>There were many
things I debunked for myself, or at least I tell myself I did.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>A screaming and crying noise from the furnace vents,
resembling a small child: I put forth that this may have been a cat in Heat,
yowling near the laundry exhaust.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A white blurry
feminine figure in the wall (Yes, in the wall) I think this could be an eerie
but natural refraction of light through the window in the bedroom I had.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Understand I was awake and in terror at this event, unable
to move and alone in the house. It looked like someone halfway up the wall next
to my bed leaning over</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>and looking at me, I passed out at sunrise, again with the
sun rising a refraction may have changed or stopped from the nights shadows and
lights.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>We once came back and found a dead bat in our trash
can.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was on top, smelled horrible,
and could have easily flew away, we don't know why it died, we used</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>no rodent poisons, only traps with spring mechanisms.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">&nbsp;</span>We left
approxiamately one month after this next thing.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>A social worker was here for this, and did see this happen.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Our niece was playing in the dining room by her own as her
mother and the Social worker talked about how the case was shaping up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Out of nowhere a small bouncy ball did a
slight jaunt to our niece, it came from behind the wall where we couldn't
see.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We'd never seen the ball, we'd
never let our niece have a toy</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>that easy to choke on.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We<span style="">&nbsp; </span>left there in the year 2001.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I have worked here for about 3 years now and at least once a
week someone has a story to tell of something unexplainable that has happened
to them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I work on the 2nd floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My old boss (she retired) saw a woman up here
roaming the floor often.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Other coworkers
and my husband have all saw this woman.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Our radios and calculators will go off and on by themselves.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My calculator would just randomly start
adding numbers and this would go on for a few minutes, other coworkers have had
this happen to them as well.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One
Saturday a friend was up here working by her self and she heard footsteps up
and down the hall but no one was there.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Another coworker saw a mans face in a window but when she went to
investigate further nothing was there.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I was told that a little girl was seen in a window on the first
floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A lady was driving down <st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">Combs Rd</st1:address></st1:Street> and saw a
small child playing in the window.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
was late so she called and one of the maintenance men went to check it out and
no one was there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It seems like there is
always something going on here that you can&#8217;t explain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Just this morning a couple of girls were here
early and a door kept opening and shutting.<span style="">&nbsp;

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Follow Catherine Street Up To Klondyk Rd Which will take you
up a big Hill with houses and people living in them along the road, till you
get about half way up, there is a gravel lane which at the end of the lane you
can take a right and leads to an occupied house, but if you follow the lane about
200 feet it leads to a dirt road and you're forced to leave your car because
the gate is closing the road off most times. (Only once did we walk up in
during the day where it was open, the road follows the whole way up the ridge,
which eventually leads to an abandoned mansion and eventually out at Tiny Town,
then out behind the Uni-Mart on Valley Street) One night me and my boyfriend
and his brother and a 2 friends of ours were partying up at the "Sitting
Stones" which are these big stones which are room for about 4 people to
sit at right at the top of the ridge, and beneath the stones is about a 100 ft
drop to a bunch of rocks. On the night of March 13, 2008, we all were sitting
on the stones and it was about 12 AM, and we weren't looking for paranormal activity
we are just a bunch of kids looking for a place to party where we won't be
seen. As we were all sitting at the rocks after about 30 minutes of sitting
there Our friend started talking about spirits and how the Mifflin County
Library has a cave behind it that 2 girls got killed at(which is right at the
base of the other side of the mountain. And the Jewish Cemetary, which is about
5 miles from Arts Ridge) And my boyfriend started talking about if there are
any spirits that they should show themeselves, and our friend was talking about
how when my boyfriends brother and him went up there earlier the day before
they were talking about how they could imagine my boyfriend sitting down on the
rock and falling down to the rocky bottom. (which is weird cause when we first
got there I attempted to put my arm around my boyfriend cause I felt scared and
he freaked out and threw my arm back cause he said he was sitting right on the
edge and was afraid of falling. (I personally felt scared just walking up the
ridge and told everyone before we got to the stones, but they all just called
me a scardy cat). Our friend kept talking about how if there were any spirits
that they'd pick him first to throw over the edge because he's black, making a
joke out of it, then he went into detail and my boyfriends brother said stop,
and he kept going and my boyfriends brother kept saying stop, stop until
finally our friend stopped and my boyfriends brother said dude I feel something
and our other friend agreed, and so did I and so did my boyfriend and my
boyfriends brother said he felt it when we started up the ridge, but he just
didn't want to say anything, and it just got worse. (Before all that started,
the whole time I was sitting there I felt like I was being watched, by more than
one thing, and I kept feeling like something was going to appear either across
the drop on the other side of the ridge, or in the drop where all the rocks
were, or behind me, I felt like it was going to come after just me, like it
targeted me) But after my boyfriends brother spoke up we all decided it was a
good idea to leave the area and get back to the road, so we all ran down the
side of the ridge, along the way my boyfriend almost fell, and his brother went
to grab a tree (it looked like a sturdy little tree) and it broke and he went
sliding down the ridge, I, who was right behind him went to grab him, but I
couldn't. He reported to have felt as if something had ahold of him. After we
ran down the ridge we got out the lane and got on Klondyk, none of us spoke for
about 5 minutes, then I said what was that and my boyfriends brother asked us
not to talk about it, please. There's something up on that ridge, we've visited
it once since then and took pictures and from that we had our friend park at
the bottom of the ridge because the gate was closed, and my boyfriends brother
took a picture right in front of the car and an orb appears in the picture,
then once we got near the sitting stones again, we found a grave for something
like a small animal or something, and at one point we were standing at the top
right after the road ends, and we all felt this prescence, the same as that
night and we snapped a picture quick and whats in that picture is it looks like
smoke (note: no one was smoking and no fog was present that night) and deriving
from the smoke you can clearly see a girl with long hair in a long dress and a
really messed up face, it gives you chills just to look at it. And there are
things around her which look like maybe a man, a horse and a carriage. Just
looking at the picture gives you chills and an eerie feeling. I still have the
pictures saved on my computer. There is definately something on that ridge,
none of us want to visit the abandoned mansion at the top of the ridge, and may
I mind you at the end of that road is Tiny Town (Which is rumored haunted) and
at the bottom of the ridge on the other side is the cave behind Mifflin County
Library, where two girls supposedly haunt after being lost and dying in the
cave. The property is not posted for tresspassing and we never got in trouble
or cops called for being on the ridge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>this is the first time I've seen your site, I think it's
interesting to finally see someone believes in odd people like me. this is my
true story. when I was young my mother and I lived in S.F. Ca. it was an older
place 2 story walk up. I was afraid of the ghost of an older man, for a while.
then one night my mom brought home groceries. she couldn't find the string in
for the light. it hung in the middle of the room. I was afrraid to go inside
with her. so I told her to ask the ghost. she looked at me and said you ask. so
I did. the light came on. My mother put the bag down looked at me strangely.
then walked out of the room. the odd thing is she used to write true stories
for Fate magazine. I have always seen stirits and the sometimes the future.
thanks for listening.</big> </p>
