<b>Spirits of Scotland</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: aliciam@isense.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>My experience with the paranormal happened in March of this year.&nbsp;
My friend and I had traveled to Scotland for vacation, and were staying
in various places throughout the country as we journeyed along. One night
we stayed in Stirling, at a youth&nbsp; hostel that was adjacent to Stirling
Castle. The hostel had been converted from a church, which was large and
quite lovely (although churches usually give me the creeps).Upon entering
the hostel, I noticed that there were graves in the yard right&nbsp; next
to the hostel building. A few of them actually propped up against the wall.
This was a bit unsettling to me, but remembering that the hostel had once
been a church, I accepted it and moved on. We had arrived late that night
and we were starving, so we started to get ready to go out for dinner.
My friend went downstairs to settle our bill, and I went to the sink and
began to wash my face.&nbsp; We were staying in a dorm style room with
bunk beds, and the sink was located in the main room where we slept. The
shower and the toilet were each separate, and on opposite sides of the
entry hallway into the room.&nbsp; As I was washing my face, I heard a
woman's voice moaning. I looked up into the mirror and saw in the reflection
the head of a woman hanging upside from the ceiling where the toilet was.
I could not see her face, but she was swinging her head from side to side,
moaning and swishing her long brown hair around like a horse would his
tail. Simultaneously, the ceiling tiles were shaking. I was so frightened,
I flew out the door and down the hallway, screaming for my friend, who
was already skipping flights of stairs frantically to get to me. His first
thought was that someone was attacking me but as soon as he saw me he knew
something was terribly wrong. We stood outside the door, and in between
hysterical sobs and suds sliding down my face, I tried to explain to him
what I saw and that there was no way in hell I was going back in there.
At this point, people started becoming curious and began to&nbsp; poke
their heads out of their rooms. We went back into the room and I began
to explain to my friend again what I had seen and what had happened. As
soon as I started to tell him what went on, we heard this low wail, the
same one i had heard earlier, and the ceiling tiles started to shake again.
My friend (quite the skeptic I might add) turned pale and screamed "Let's
get the !@#$ out of here!" I was already out the door, soap still on my
face. We ended up going to a resteraunt, but we drank more than we ate.
My friend, who hates alcohol, drank 3 beers. We went back to the room,
and slept in shifts. I really didnt sleep much at all, quite frankly, and
in retrospect I would have gotten a better nights sleep in the car!</b>

<br><b>Scary Stuff</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: caligurl89@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>This is my ghost experience. I'm 11 year old girl and</b>
<br><b>I do believe in ghosts. One night I was going to find</b>
<br><b>something to drink. And then I saw a black creature</b>
<br><b>that looked like a cat and a chihuaua combined. Now I</b>
<br><b>have a dark grey cat. But he NEVER comes to me. Well</b>
<br><b>the catdog thing snuggled against me and the minute I</b>
<br><b>turned the thing dissapeared. But my parents can't see</b>
<br><b>this thing. The next day at the same time I saw the</b>
<br><b>thing I heard a low pitched howl in my room. I was</b>
<br><b>half asleep when I heard that and I thought it was my</b>
<br><b>neighbors dog. I looked out my window and I saw no</b>
<br><b>dogs but I saw a circular shape. I thought it was and</b>
<br><b>orb. And it was. So I freaked out and slept in the</b>
<br><b>living room near my dad. The day after that I took a</b>
<br><b>picture of my mom with an I-Zone camera. I saw smoke</b>
<br><b>and a flashing string on the photo. Half of me said</b>
<br><b>that was an error on the film and the other half said</b>
<br><b>it was paranormal. I threw that photo away because it</b>
<br><b>freaks me out. I don't want to get rid of the</b>
<br><b>ghost/demon or move because I think my parents will</b>
<br><b>send me to the funny farm.</b>

<br><b>Bumps in the Night at Fremantle Prison</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:pjthk@mailcity.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>In May 2000 myself and my wife visited WA for a 2 week holiday and
in the second week as we headed south to the wine region&nbsp; we stopped
in Fremantle for two nights. After travelling around the town for while
we made an enquiry at a bed and breakfast and were told there wer no rooms
available but we could rent a cottage. We agreed to take a look and after
seeing the pleasant cottages up on the hill near the prison entrance, decided
to stay there and paid in advance.After unpacking our kit we headed into
town to do some shopping and during our visit to a clothes store we got
chatting to an assistant and during our conversation we discussed where
we were staying and commented it might be a bit spooky. The girl replied
that she had heard the cottages were haunted by ex convicts but not to
worry because all they do is stare at you. Rather disconcerted we asked
who had told her and she replied that her brother-in-law ? (I'm not sure)
stayed there during renovations at the prison. We laughed nervously and
left with the shopping.By 10-o-clock and after a few beers we nervously
returned to our gloomy cottage and were quite relieved to find nothing
waiting for us. We setttled down in the big cast iron bed for sleep (but
left a small light on). Suddenly at about 5-o-clock the next moring we
both awoke at the same time - it was quiet initially. Suddenly a loud resounding
bell sounded somewhere outside and was followed by the sounds of metal
on stone. Convicts breaking rocks ? - we didn‘t look outside to find out.
The sounds continued for a few minutes and ended as suddenly as they began.
We drifted off to sleep after while. The nexy day we discussed what had
occurred and between us rationalised the experience. We‘d been spooked
by the girl in the shop, the booze had disturbed our sleep and the noises
had been caused by someone nearby. We went to Rottnest for the day and
returned determined to spend a happy evening in the cottage. After eating
in the kitchen we settled on the sofa to watch</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;TV and did n’t drink any alcohol. About half way through The
Bill there was a resounding crash which sounded like someone had violently
kicked the back yard door. We looked at each other but neither of us wanted
to investigate as the back door only led to a high walled yard abutting
the prison wall. Unhappy but determined we went to bed and this time I
put my ear plugs in to avoid the sounds of the chain gang. Suddenly again
it was 5am and we were both awake. I was rather annoyed and determined
to sleep and my wife tried also. Suddenly I felt the bed shaking as if
someone were holding the frame and pushing it. This stopped after a short
while and then, according to my wife, the bell and chain gang started again.
Eventually we slept again and awoke mid morning relieved to move out.</b>
<br><b>Both of us liked Fremantle but we would n’t stay in those cottages
again even if we were paid to. Plenty of people have tried to tell us it
was our imagination fired by the shop girl’s story, due to drinking or
earth tremors - but to us it was plain spooky. If someone else knows the
reasons for our experiences, knows that the girl was bullshitting us or
can confirm the hauntings, please write back to me at pjthk@netvigator.com

<p><b>I Became A Believer</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: barnacleboy@mindspring.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My name is Paul Kepp, and the summer when I was
13, my mother and I bought a house in North Lima, Ohio and I was more than
excited to see it.&nbsp; When we pulled up I ran inside the house to find
a deserted house with no furniter; no nothing.&nbsp; Naturally I wanted
to get a feeling for the house and I began exploring the house.&nbsp; The
layout was like this, you had a screen door that was in the back of the
house (the main entrance we used) and led into the kitchen, to your right
and in front of you was a door that led to the basement (a place I never
ventured in my entire time (three months) in the house.) and to the far
right was a door that led to my room and to the right of that was the bathroom.&nbsp;
Going the other way through the kitchen takes you to the dining room and
the living room was next to that in an open area and then that led back
to my room on the other side. (a complete circle)&nbsp; Between the living
and dining room was the main door (That ended up being blocked by furniture,
go figure) and opposite of that were the steps that led upstairs.&nbsp;
a good amount of steps would come to a small square that would turn 180
and the stops would go up the other way.&nbsp; At the top there was a room
that was on the left (my moms), a room to my right (my Aunt's), and a center
room (storage).&nbsp; I first went inside the middle room and I looked
out the window and I immediately got hte feeling like somoene was behind
me and it gave me a very threatening feeling, the hair on the back of my
neck stood up and I bolted outside.&nbsp; This experience was 5 years ago
and I can't tell what</b>
<br><b>happened first, last, et cetera, but among the things I encountered
were footsteps at night that would last for quite awhile almost everynight.&nbsp;
I once found a coke can crushed and sitting at the first step leading upstairs,
I had one of those push-button TV's that went haywire (the button's pushed
themselves) while playing Nintendo. I had a cat that would sit at the base
of the steps and peer upstairs for the longest time.&nbsp; I'm pretty sure
it was almost every night I spent in my mom's room and one night I seen
a spectre of a farmer mumbling (I was surprised that no photo's on your
site showed a complete person but this is what I saw and it scared me .)
I may be forgetting an experience or two but those were the big ones; my
aunt experienced her bed moving and layed down her keys and turned around
to grab them and they were gone.&nbsp; My mother seen everything in the
storage room in disarray with paper everywhere, she also had a skeleton
key pushed into her hand while sleeping. This was my only experience with
a haunting but it made a believer out of me.</b>

<br><b>A Haunted Staircase and Old Doll</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Elizabeth@verrill.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>My first story takes place when I was about five (I am 14 now) and
living in</b>
<br><b>an old, eighteenth century house in Preston, Connecticut. My older
sister</b>
<br><b>and I were watching Saturday Night Live in her room while my parents
were</b>
<br><b>out to eat. There was the front staircase which we hardly ever used,
and it</b>
<br><b>went down to three doors. The door in front of you went ouside,
the door to</b>
<br><b>your left went to the dining room, and the one on the right went
into my</b>
<br><b>dad's study. There was a shelf that went along side the stairs that
had a</b>
<br><b>few encylopedias on it. Well, my sister and I were watching the
show when</b>
<br><b>all of a sudden we heard loud thumping that went down the stairs.
We looked</b>
<br><b>at each other, and we were scared, but we decided it must have been
that one</b>
<br><b>of the books had fallen (though how we had no idea). We ran over
to the door</b>
<br><b>that led to the stairs and opened it, but there was nothing there.
There</b>
<br><b>were no books misplaced, but we had the erie feeling we were being
watched.</b>
<br><b>The scariest part was when our big Akita, Koko, went halfway down
the stairs</b>
<br><b>and was growling, very menacingly, and she was in a dog's threat
posture.</b>
<br><b>Then, without warning, she made a kind of choked off whimper and
ran</b>
<br><b>upstairs. Now, this dog was huge, and not afraid to growl at anything
or</b>
<br><b>anyone, but something really scared her. My sister and I reflected
later,</b>
<br><b>and we both agreed that the thumps sounded more like footsteps than
books</b>
<br><b>falling. We thought it might have been a burgler, but nothing was
missing</b>
<br><b>when our parents got home, and no one was found in the house. Plus,
my</b>
<br><b>sister and I would have heard it if someone moved in either of the
two rooms</b>
<br><b>or we would have seen someone outside, but nothing was out of the
ordinary.</b>
<br><b>We told my parents about it, but they laughed it off. A few days
later, my</b>
<br><b>sister, her best friend Melanie, and I were outside playing softball
in our</b>
<br><b>backyard when somehow, we all looked up at the attic window at the
same</b>
<br><b>time. We all saw the face of a girl, but in was only there for about</b>
<br><b>two-three seconds. There were some other weird occurences, but those
were</b>
<br><b>the most vivid and strangest.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;My next story is actually my friend Jordanna's. This girl
is the</b>
<br><b>most honest person you could ever hope to meet, and she is sooo
sweet and</b>
<br><b>caring that a lot of people take advantage of her. She has no reason
to make</b>
<br><b>this up and she even has proof.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Her mother always buys her old dolls from antique shops and
they are</b>
<br><b>displayed in her room. She picked up one doll and told us about
it. It's</b>
<br><b>ugly, and possessed, it seems. She had a few friends sleep over
one night,</b>
<br><b>and they were mucking around with walkie-talkies one of them brought
over.</b>
<br><b>One of the girls left one upstairs turned on because she had to
go to the</b>
<br><b>bathroom, and while she was gone, a weird, childish voice was heard
talking</b>
<br><b>over into the 'talkie. Jordanna and her friend thought it was the
other</b>
<br><b>girl, but when they went upstairs to look, the girl was in the bathroom
and</b>
<br><b>the 'talkie was in Jordanna's bedroom. The ugly doll was standing
right next</b>
<br><b>to the 'talkie, and that doll was not there when the girl put it
down.</b>
<br><b>Another thing happened when the girls were leaving: they were going
to</b>
<br><b>another girls' house and Jordanna was with them. They were waving
to</b>
<br><b>Jordanna's mom when they all saw the doll standing in the window
with it's</b>
<br><b>hand up, like it was waving. All of the girls said they had not
done it, and</b>
<br><b>Jordanna's mom wouldn't have, because she's not into that sort of
thing.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;One day when Jordanna was cleaning her room, she knocked the
doll</b>
<br><b>over and the back of its head busted open. A third eye was in the
head,</b>
<br><b>staring out the back just as normally as any regular doll's eye.
She showed</b>
<br><b>us the eye that was still in the head, as proof for her story. Her
mom won't</b>
<br><b>let her throw the doll away because it is an antique. This may sound
really</b>
<br><b>strange (though not as strange as the rest of this story), but Jordanna
made</b>
<br><b>up rules for the doll. It can only come to life when a thousand
people are</b>
<br><b>in the house all at once, so needless to say, it shouldn't be waking
up</b>
<br><b>anytime soon. But when we (two of my friends and I) were in Jordanna's
room</b>
<br><b>at one point, BEFORE she told us this story, we were looking at
the doll and</b>
<br><b>fooling around with its hat. We put it on sideways so the feather
was on the</b>
<br><b>right, and we are positive to this day that it was on the right.
Jordanna</b>
<br><b>walked in and asked us what we were doing, and when we turned around
to show</b>
<br><b>her what we were messing with, the feather was on the left side
of the hat.</b>
<br><b>Jordanna told us the doll doesn't like to be played with, and then
she told</b>
<br><b>us the story.</b>

<p><b>Eloise Hospital</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: erixmail@mediaone.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the town of Wayne, MI (suburb of Detroit) there
is a building</b>
<br><b>presently called The Kay Beard Center, operated by Wayne County
Social</b>
<br><b>Services. This building had served as a mental asylum for women
since</b>
<br><b>the 1930's, known as "Eloise Hospital" up until the 1990's. They</b>
<br><b>currently use only the bottom floor as a day care center and various</b>
<br><b>administrative offices.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Employees have reported strange occurrances here
- unknown people</b>
<br><b>walking about on the upper floors, talking, screaming. These reported</b>
<br><b>incidents had recently aroused the curiousity of a local TV station
here</b>
<br><b>in Detroit, WXYZ Channel 7. They sent a camera crew along with</b>
<br><b>investigators in the paranormal to see if they had a story. They
were</b>
<br><b>not disappointed.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to many eyewitness accounts, the
paranormal</b>
<br><b>investigators shot dozens of polaroid photographs as the tour was
being</b>
<br><b>conducted. Most photos revealed these little "orbs" floating around
all</b>
<br><b>over the place. They then interviewed a photography expert to attempt
to</b>
<br><b>explain these orbs. After examination, his conclusion was that the
orbs</b>
<br><b>appearing in the photos were not of external origin but rather objects</b>
<br><b>present at the time of the photo. But perhaps the most compelling
part</b>
<br><b>of this expose was the actual news footage shot out of one of the</b>
<br><b>windows towards an adjascent wing of the building (closed). One
can</b>
<br><b>clearly see the face of a woman staring back from one of the upper
floor</b>
<br><b>windows</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Personally, I am often skeptical of local news
content because they</b>
<br><b>tend to sensationalize, but with the evidence presented, I feel
that</b>
<br><b>there was clearly something that could bear further investigation.
The</b>
<br><b>area surrounding this building has a lot of unfortunate history,
this</b>
<br><b>area also had served as a poor farm during the depression. There
is also</b>
<br><b>a pauper's cemetary nearby of unmarked graves for its previous</b>
<br><b>inhabitants.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are interested, I could see about getting
file footage on</b>
<br><b>this news article. I would also appreciate it if you could tell
me if</b>
<br><b>you have ever received anything about "Eloise" from other visitors
to</b>
<br><b>your web site.</b>

<br><b>3 Life Experiences</b>

<p><b>By: Luvmychicas@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;There haven't been many weird things in my life, but these
are weird. I'v</b>
<br><b>had three life experiences. 1 was when I was 11. I was over at a
friend's</b>
<br><b>house to sleep over. I woke up that morning to a very cold sensation
and a</b>
<br><b>hard time breathing. All of a sudden, an attractive woman appeared
in old</b>
<br><b>maid's clothing. With her cold breath and English way of talking,
she simply</b>
<br><b>stated to me, "Miss, you're going to need to get up. I need to do
the</b>
<br><b>sheets.</b>
<br><b>Your breakfast is on the table downstairs."Well, I went downstairs
and said</b>
<br><b>puzzled in the state of sleepiness, " I didn't know you had a maid."
Her</b>
<br><b>parents replied, "We don't. I soon found out I had the rare experience
of</b>
<br><b>meeting the lady in black. My second experience was when I was 12.
My father</b>
<br><b>and I knew a lady who owned an old civil war hospital. My dad and
I wanted</b>
<br><b>to "ghost hunt". We got there late and were exhasted, so we went
to bed. That</b>
<br><b>night, I woke up in the middle of the night to a large breasted
woman asking</b>
<br><b>me if I was ok. ( We were in the old very extremely haunted emergency
wing)</b>
<br><b>I said, "Yea. Thanks for asking." Soon after that she disappeared
in a mist.</b>
<br><b>The next day, I told my dad and he totaly beleived me. We tried
helping the</b>
<br><b>lady wash off some of the old bloodstaines and went downstairs to
eat lunch.</b>
<br><b>When we came back up, they were back and there was fresh blood too.
We all</b>
<br><b>screamed and ran downstaires. I still continue to go there to do
"research".</b>
<br><b>My 3 experience was a Oijia board. Let's just say it was out of

<br><b>Two Diffrent Experiences with Ghosts</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: hudine@btinternet.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hi I'm 18, female and I live in Northern Ireland.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Living in Northern Ireland you grow up hearing ghost stories, and
stories about lepracorns and fairies and stuff. I used to laugh at my granny
when she talked about this stuff. As well as my freinds, heck there is
an old ghost story about a headless drummer boy that wonders the grounds
of mourne park (The local camping ground for school tips). It's said you
can hear the drummer boy walking along still beating his drum. Well to
show you how much I believed in this stuff I brought a tin bucket to the
camp one day and drumed on it, and scared some 40 school kids and there
teachers half to death.Well then I was with my dad at a friends house,
in Nerwy, County Down. My friend was talking about leaving the house he
was in. When I asked why he said that there was strange things happening
in the house.Him and the wife would sit in the living room and hear footsteps
upstairs, and someone walk down the stairs and out the front door. One
time there was a music box in one of the daughters wardrobs and it started
playing by it's self and scared the life out of her. Well they all thought
she was playing tricks, so they boxed it up and put it in their wardrob.
Well it was all boxed up and one night about a month later it played by
it's self again. Of corse by this time me and my dad was laughing at them.
I was sitting in a arm chair in the livving room, looking out at the stairs
and the hallway leading to the front door (there is about 3 ft from one
to the other). Well the next thing I know we can hear walking upstarirs,
then going down the stairs, and the front door (witch I can remember locking)
opend up by it's self. I would have saw someone oping the door and walking
down the stairs from where I was sitting. I even looked upstairs no one
there, looked at the door no wires, no sighns of trickary. Nothing. I've
not been back in there since.The second time something happend to me. I
was on vacation with my mum and brother. We were in Tunisa, at an old Roman
amputhater. We were looking arond in the pit downstairs, and there was
nothing unusal, untill we whent into one area. My, brother, mum (who by
the way dosn't beleive this stuff either, still dosn't) and I all felt
this bad feeling. We stop dead in our tracks in a suddent feelling of toatal</b>
<br><b>and utter terror, like we where about to die. My mum whanted to
go further into the place and go up the steps there, but me and my bro
was to scared, and ran like heck in the other direction. I was stupid I
should have taken a photo with my digetal camra to see if anything turned
up, but I was too scared.Well that's all that's happend to me personaly.
Though my unchles naibours swore they saw him walking around the&nbsp;
backgaurden in the rain, 2 hours after he died.</b>

<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi I am From California and would like to share my
experiences with some</b>
<br><b>people. I have experienced some terrifying ghostlike figures in
my small</b>
<br><b>house of C.A. I remember the quit night I was with my mother watching
"Gone</b>
<br><b>With The Wind." My father left for a baseball game about 2 hours
earlyer. He</b>
<br><b>took both of my brothers with him. My mother and I&nbsp; had gone
to bed. about 5</b>
<br><b>minutes later I saw the kitchen light go on. I thought, "Oh there
my dad is!"</b>
<br><b>I was soooo excited that he had come home for we had started to
get worried</b>
<br><b>about him. approximently 3 minutes later my father still hadn't
come up the</b>
<br><b>hallway. It was a nice one story house. I called his name ancously
waiting</b>
<br><b>for him to tuck me in. Then the light went out.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Two of my friends and I went to this abondoned church in McCormick
county Sc.</b>
<br><b>They started acting alittle crazy as we neared an abondoned church,
you know</b>

into the</b>
<br><b>parking lot and refused to get out of the car...we where miles away
from</b>
<br><b>anyone if we needed help and it was the middle of the night. Well
this was a</b>
<br><b>windless and cloudness night but, I felt like we where being watched.
And had</b>
<br><b>a strange feeling about being there. I wanted to leave and told
my friends</b>
<br><b>that, but they decided they wanted to have some "fun " first one
of them</b>
<br><b>light a couple of candles. And after a few minutes of being let
the went out</b>
<br><b>on their own. Liek I said this was a windless night. Well after
a few minutes</b>
<br><b>of me watchinmgg them act crazy I started my car up and was about
to leave</b>
<br><b>them there, I looked out the window and saw an outline of a figure
in the</b>
<br><b>sky. My friends saw it to and started running back to the car one
of them was</b>
<br><b>pushed down but made it to the car without any injures. After we
started back</b>
<br><b>home the other one felt something ice cold gripping her neck. I

<p><b>Haunted Places in PA</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Tkestral@hotmail.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>i was recently checking out your Haunted Places PA page. I saw an
entry on</b>
<br><b>the University of Pittsburgh in Johnstown, that reminded me of my
own</b>
<br><b>personal experiences with ghosts at the campus.</b>
<br><b>About 3 years ago, myself, my twin sister, our friends Ashley, Jackie,
and</b>
<br><b>Michelle were staying at the college during a summer music camp.
We met</b>
<br><b>Michelle at the camp, she was my sister's roommate, and we grew
to be good</b>
<br><b>friends.</b>
<br><b>One night, we were hanging out in barb and michelles dorm room,
and since we</b>
<br><b>were coincidentally all practicing Wiccans, we decided to excercise
our</b>
<br><b>psychic abilities. That night, Michelle, Jackie, and Ashley all
succesfully</b>
<br><b>astral-projected. For those of you unfamiliar with the practice,
it's where</b>
<br><b>you're astral body, (your mind, your spirit, your soul, whatever
you wish to</b>
<br><b>call it.) leaves the body, andyou (in astral form) are free to project</b>
<br><b>around, see things some people can't (as we found out) and more
or less</b>
<br><b>exist on a different plane of consciousness.</b>
<br><b>During one of Michelle's foray into the astral plane, she travelled
into the</b>
<br><b>Pasquerella Preforming Arts Center's (PPAC) basement. She describes
feeling</b>
<br><b>a horrible, terrible, terrorizing 'blackness' oozing from the walls.
In real</b>
<br><b>life, she sat up from the bed, got up, and started walking. She
had a pained</b>
<br><b>expression on her face, but other than that her face showed no sign
of being</b>
<br><b>awake. She walked towards the dorm door, and, basically, scared
the living</b>
<br><b>crap out of all of us. We screamed her name, clapped, yelled at
her to wake</b>
<br><b>up, and finally, touched her. The rule of Astral projecting is to
never</b>
<br><b>touch the person, it can jerk the astral body back into the physical
and can</b>
<br><b>'shock' the person. The second we touched Michelle she fell limp
and</b>
<br><b>immediately, wihtout a second of pause or hesitation, started crying
harder</b>
<br><b>than i've ever seen anyone cry. We packed up our tools and went
to sleep. No</b>
<br><b>one wanted to, but we had to be awake early for class.</b>
<br><b>A year later, we were back on the campus for the same music camp.
Michelle</b>
<br><b>was not at the camp that year, and Jackie wasn't staying over night,
so we</b>
<br><b>really didn't delve into astral projecting or anything.. but that
didn't</b>
<br><b>stop anything. After dinner, local talents held recitals in the
PPAC.</b>
<br><b>Typically, we fell asleep. Just before dozing off, i remember the
theatre</b>
<br><b>turning ice cold. Now, it's an air conditioned building and it was
quite</b>
<br><b>chilly in the first place, but the temperature&nbsp; dropped significantly.
i</b>
<br><b>noted the occurance but didn't feel the need to discuss it.</b>
<br><b>Later, in barb and ashly's dorm room, she told us she'd seen a ghost
sitting</b>
<br><b>in the PPAC, not near anyone, sitting quietly. She was</b>
<br><b>sitting still, older than the students but younger than the teachers,
with</b>
<br><b>curly, red-blondish hair. And she was slightly transparent. At first
none of</b>
<br><b>us believed ashley, she really didn't beleive herself, she'd been
nodding</b>
<br><b>off to sleep like the rest of us. The next day, she saw her again.</b>
<br><b>Throughout the week, Ashley saw her about twice a day. In a backstage
room</b>
<br><b>in the PPAC, Ashley had a camera, filming tge ckass experimenting
with</b>
<br><b>makeup-bruises. No one was around the table, and the camera was
sitting in</b>
<br><b>her backpack in the middle of the table. The camera and backpack
was pushed</b>
<br><b>onto the floor. It was fine, and the next week, ashley reviewed
the tape to</b>
<br><b>find a shadow in the corner of the mirror where she is assured nothing
could</b>
<br><b>have reflected or walked past the mirror. Unfortunately, this spooky</b>
<br><b>videotape was recorded over with footage from her kid brothers baseball</b>
<br><b>game. I've never seen the tape, but ashley is not the kind of person
to joke</b>
<br><b>about these matters.</b>
<br><b>Throughout the week, ashley took note of the ghost. Her name was
Jenny. She</b>
<br><b>had curly, reddish-blond hair, freckles, was tall, and appeared
to be in her</b>
<br><b>20's. She was not limited to the PPAC, she was also seen walking
the</b>
<br><b>sidewalks and pathways through the woods, near the Living and Leaning</b>
<br><b>Center. Ashley also recalls seeing dark spots on Jenny's wrists,
could</b>
<br><b>possibly be slit marks.</b>
<br><b>Not much else has happened since then, but the camp continues this
year,</b>
<br><b>next week, actually. If anything supernatural should occur, i'll
be sure to</b>
<br><b>tell you. I hope my account could contribute to your webpages, i
assure you</b>
<br><b>everything i've said is, to the best of my knowledge, completely
true and</b>
<br><b>told to the best of my abilities. If my story sounds hokey or fake,
that's</b>
<br><b>just my way of writing and i apologize. Well, happy hunting,</b>

<br><b>Want to Touch the Baby</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: kdcbmc@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I don't really know where to begin.&nbsp; I guess it all started
before I was</b>
<br><b>born.&nbsp; I was going through a really rough time in my life,
getting into</b>
<br><b>trouble, and my parents sat me down and had a talk with me that
was probably</b>
<br><b>long overdue.&nbsp; My father had his own experience for several
years, and so</b>
<br><b>there has been a history of experiences in my family.&nbsp; My mother
told me</b>
<br><b>that when she was approximately 7 months pregnant with me, she and
my father</b>
<br><b>were staying at my grandparent's house for the weekend, and she
awoke out of</b>
<br><b>a dead sleep one night to discover an apparition standing beside
her bed,</b>
<br><b>and saw hands reaching for her stomach.&nbsp; She swears up and
down that she was</b>
<br><b>not dreaming, because she felt the cold that people always talk
about.&nbsp; It</b>
<br><b>scared the living daylights out of her.&nbsp; She didn't know if
it was something</b>
<br><b>to be concerned about, or if it was maybe one of our deceased family
members</b>
<br><b>that just wanted to "touch the baby".&nbsp; Everyone always talks
about guardian</b>
<br><b>angels, and I believe in it.&nbsp; I think everyone has a guardian
angel.&nbsp; Both</b>
<br><b>of my parents had an experience when I was born.&nbsp; But it is
hard to</b>
<br><b>determine whether or not it was a good one.&nbsp; From my father's
account, he</b>
<br><b>said it was like there was someone standing right beside him, whispering</b>
<br><b>into his ear, that I was different somehow, and that if I was not
taken care</b>
<br><b>of and watched every minute, that I would never live to be an adult.&nbsp;
I</b>
<br><b>don't know what this means.&nbsp; I am now almost 24 years old,
and have had</b>
<br><b>several experiences in my life that probably shouldn't have turned
out as</b>
<br><b>good as they did.&nbsp; Is it luck?&nbsp; I believe that someone
was watching over me.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; When I was a baby, my parents built a house.&nbsp; Being
newly built, obviously</b>
<br><b>no one had lived there before, so there was no history of any death
in the</b>
<br><b>house, or anything.&nbsp; But, there was something in that house.&nbsp;
My father</b>
<br><b>thinks that it was the same spirit that had been in his life for
years.&nbsp; My</b>
<br><b>mother is very sensitive to things like that, so she always knows
if there</b>
<br><b>is something not quite right.&nbsp; There was a spirit of some kind
in the house,</b>
<br><b>but I was so young that I don't remember anything about it, I can
only go by</b>
<br><b>what my parents tell me.&nbsp; My father was the main one that this
spirit seemed</b>
<br><b>to connect to, or whatever it is that spirits do.&nbsp; He states
that he can</b>
<br><b>remember this spirit being there from his earlies memories, so apparently,</b>
<br><b>it had been hanging around for quite some time.&nbsp; I don't really
know how</b>
<br><b>long it was in the house, I just remember my mother telling me that
one day,</b>
<br><b>after my father was gone to work, and my sister and I were gone
to school,</b>
<br><b>she was home alone, and felt that there was something in the room
with her.</b>
<br><b>She said it felt like there were pins and needles down her neck,
and had</b>
<br><b>this chill just run through her body.&nbsp; She just got scared
enough that she</b>
<br><b>stood up and started yelling at whoever, or whatever it was to leave
her</b>
<br><b>house, and leave her and her family alone, and she said since then,
she</b>
<br><b>hasn't had any experiences with it.&nbsp; There was a time when
they were renting</b>
<br><b>a house until the house that they were buying became vacant, and
my mother</b>
<br><b>would not go downstairs by herself.&nbsp; She wouldn't even open
the door to the</b>
<br><b>basement, unless there was someone there with her.&nbsp; They even
had our priest</b>
<br><b>come over to bless the house.&nbsp; Mom said that the first time
they ever looked</b>
<br><b>at the house, she knew there was something there.&nbsp; Is there
some reason why</b>
<br><b>my entire family would have these experiences?&nbsp; Why my parents
were always</b>
<br><b>scared to death that something was going to take me from them before
"my</b>
<br><b>time"?&nbsp; I, myself, have never had any true experiences, or
sightings, only</b>
<br><b>that every once in a while, I think I hear someone whistling.&nbsp;
It's a</b>
<br><b>familiar tune, and always the same, but I couldn't whistle it myself.&nbsp;
It's</b>
<br><b>like as soon as it stops, I forget the tune.&nbsp; I wish I would
have a true</b>
<br><b>experience.&nbsp; I would love to be able to tell my family the
answer to all of</b>
<br><b>the questions that they have had over the years.&nbsp; My father
wrote a story</b>
<br><b>about his experiences that I have not read.&nbsp; I think it's time
I dig it out.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; If I read it, and find that it may be something that you
are interested</b>
<br><b>in, I'll send you a snippit or two.&nbsp; Thanks for listening.</b>

<br><b>&nbsp;What's Waking Me</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: butlerange@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>For a year or so I've been woken up by something or someone in my
room. It</b>
<br><b>doesn't matter where I live or how long I've lived there, I'm always
woken</b>
<br><b>up by the same presence. The most recent started a couple of months
ago. The</b>
<br><b>apartment that I'm currently living in is in Maryland. We've only
been here</b>
<br><b>since January, 2000, we've moved down from Mass and are moving back
next</b>
<br><b>month. But when I'm woken up by what ever it is that wakes me I
see pieces</b>
<br><b>of the room are blurred but not distorted. Like seeing through glass
that</b>
<br><b>has water on it. Usually there is only one or at least that's what
I've only</b>
<br><b>seen, however last week I woke up to four figures all dressed in
black</b>
<br><b>wearing black hats standing on my boyfriends side of the bed. When
I saw</b>
<br><b>them, they seemed to be about 10ft away from the side of the bed.
(There</b>
<br><b>isn't even five feet to the wall from that side of the bed) I sat
straight</b>
<br><b>up and said "Chris! Wake up, don't you see them?!" I then made him
switch</b>
<br><b>sides of the bed with me as if to protect him. I knew though that
they would</b>
<br><b>hurt either of us. Chris didn't remember anything in the morning,
didn't</b>
<br><b>even remember switching sides of the bed.</b>
<br><b>A couple of weeks before, particularly the night(3am) before my
grandmother</b>
<br><b>died. (In Maine) I saw two different sized forms (first time in
multiples).</b>
<br><b>The smaller one stayed closer to the side of the room that I was
on and the</b>
<br><b>larger one on the side of the room that my sister was sleeping on.
Again not</b>
<br><b>scared. I looked at them and whispered to watch over us and to go
to my</b>
<br><b>grandmother who needed all the support she could get. The next day
I learned</b>
<br><b>that my grandmother at three a.m. took another turn for the worst
and later</b>
<br><b>died at 11:30 am.</b>
<br><b>I've talked to my mother and she believes these are forms of Angels
and to</b>
<br><b>find away to talk to them. I've tried twice successfully, the second
time</b>
<br><b>with my grandmother. The first time back here in Maryland, at night,
again</b>
<br><b>woken up, I told them that I was "okay and happy. There are children
right</b>
<br><b>now that really need you and you should go to them." I assume that
they did</b>
<br><b>since I hadn't seen them since.</b>
<br><b>Now it is almost a weekly (no less than twice a week) occurrence.
The last</b>
<br><b>time I really panicked and had to turn on lights to make sure what
ever it</b>
<br><b>was wasn't there. It was just unexpected.</b>
<br><b>Now for the past couple of days I've been getting a "feeling" in
certain</b>
<br><b>areas of the apartment. The bedroom's interior wall and the wall
with the</b>
<br><b>central air conditioner is the strongest areas. I keep lights on
in rooms</b>
<br><b>that I'm not in or that are near by so I don't have to go in to
a dark room.</b>
<br><b>I also did this at my mother's house in Maine for several years
until I</b>
<br><b>moved out. I used to turn on the living room lights which would
light the</b>
<br><b>bottom of the stairs. Turn on the hallway lights to the stairs,
go up and</b>
<br><b>turn on my bedroom light. Then I would go down and turn them off&nbsp;
in the</b>
<br><b>order that I turned them on just not to be in the dark. The same
routine</b>
<br><b>would happen when I'd go to the bathroom not more than 5 feet way
from my</b>
<br><b>room, but would have to go in to the hallway.</b>
<br><b>I hope I'm not creating these experiences or just dreaming them
up. I know</b>
<br><b>I'm awake when all of this happens and it's making me really "jumpy".
I get</b>
<br><b>startled easily and have problems sleeping.</b>
<br><b>My sister saw found your website looking for answers for since I
have no</b>
<br><b>where to start. I don't know what books to look and want answers.</b>
<br><b>I hope you'll be able to point me in the right direction.</b>
<br><b>Your input is appreciated and hope to hear from you soon.</b>

<p><b>&nbsp;Moving Spirits</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Ibclever2@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>At the risk of sounding certifiable I would like to share the following</b>
<br><b>personal story.&nbsp; Let me introduce myself, my name is Shirley
, I live</b>
<br><b>in Pico Riveria, California, its a suburb of Los Angeles. I teach
religion</b>
<br><b>and honors algebra; as well as coordinate the Confirmation program
at my</b>
<br><b>parish.</b>
<br><b>The experience I am about to share I have only shared with two other
people.</b>
<br><b>I have never heard or read anything like what I am about to share.&nbsp;
Then</b>
<br><b>again I haven't searched a lot for similar experiences.&nbsp; When
I was 22 I got</b>
<br><b>a job teaching at the old abandoned Lincoln Heights Jail.&nbsp;
While I was still</b>
<br><b>in college.&nbsp; My classroom was where the lawyers would visit
with their</b>
<br><b>clients.&nbsp; The building was eerie to say the least but we managed
to make it</b>
<br><b>nice.</b>
<br><b>I am going to give you the conditions of the night.&nbsp; This happened
around</b>
<br><b>September or October 1972.&nbsp; The night was crisp, windy, and
there were white</b>
<br><b>clouds in the sky.&nbsp; Three must have been a full moon because
I could see the</b>
<br><b>clouds in the sky.</b>
<br><b>I had been studying and I decided to take a break I walked over
to the front</b>
<br><b>room bay window and looked out just taking a mental break turned
on the</b>
<br><b>stereo and looked out to see if I could see my cousin coming home.&nbsp;
I looked</b>
<br><b>up at the sky and was watching the clouds move into each other.&nbsp;
Then, I</b>
<br><b>began to see spirits, move across the sky.&nbsp; Many of them.&nbsp;
No, I was not</b>
<br><b>drinking and I did not do drugs.&nbsp; The reason I am sharing this
with you is</b>
<br><b>because there is a picture of a Texas Chile contest with orbs.&nbsp;
This is</b>
<br><b>similar to the way the apparition were moving.&nbsp; I recognized
the what I saw</b>
<br><b>only I saw shapes: I could distinguish features.&nbsp; Thinking
it must be my</b>
<br><b>imagination I went back to studying, got ready for bed and then
some time</b>
<br><b>later went back to the window.&nbsp; Again I saw the same apparition.&nbsp;
I went</b>
<br><b>outside to see if I could see anyone projecting anything from the
hills</b>
<br><b>around me.&nbsp; I looked to see if I could see any film truck from
Hollywood.</b>
<br><b>The next morning I bought the paper to see if anyone had written
about what I</b>
<br><b>had seen.&nbsp; Because the screen actors guild owned and operated
out of the</b>
<br><b>second floor of the building I asked if they had shot a movie last
night.</b>
<br><b>Nothing.&nbsp; So up until now I have kept this experience pretty
much to myself.</b>
<br><b>It is difficult for me to believe what I experienced.&nbsp; It is
even more</b>
<br><b>difficult for me to expect someone else to believe what I have just
shared.</b>
<br><b>To this day when I look up at the sky at night I wonder if I will
ever see</b>
<br><b>what I saw that evening.</b>
<br><b>Today is the first time I have every read the name of the types
of</b>
<br><b>apparitions.&nbsp; I did not see anything like what I saw in the
photographs.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>saw features, I could identify characteristics, like people from
all eras in</b>
<br><b>life.&nbsp; There form was more of a cloud.&nbsp; The movement much
like the picture</b>
<br><b>with the chilie contest.</b>
<br><b>I have one other personal experience.&nbsp; But, I would like impute
from you.</b>
<br><b>Have you ever heard of something like this.&nbsp; Is this possible?
Or do you</b>
<br><b>agree, it could have been Hollywood doing some type of trick photography?</b>

<p><b>&nbsp;I Feel Him</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: kpsmiley@swbell.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>Here's my experience with a ghost, I think.. Could somebody please
let</b>
<br><b>me know what they think?</b>
<br><b>Last fall, I woke up in the middle of the night, something quite
strange</b>
<br><b>for me to do.&nbsp; I could have sworn that I heard someone flipping
through</b>
<br><b>the pages of one of my books across the room.&nbsp; I had a gut
feeling that</b>
<br><b>someone was in the room with me.&nbsp; I didn't see anything, and
upon</b>
<br><b>turning my lamp on didn't see anything either.&nbsp; Nothing was
out of</b>
<br><b>place.&nbsp; I went back to sleep and that was it.</b>
<br><b>A few weeks later, I again woke up in the middle of the night and
knew</b>
<br><b>someone was in bed with me.&nbsp; It wasn't a big deal, I just thought
"Oh,</b>
<br><b>he's laying behind me." and fell asleep again.&nbsp; For some reason,
it</b>
<br><b>didn't seem like anything out of the ordinary.&nbsp; Again, I didn't
see</b>
<br><b>anything or hear anything.</b>
<br><b>Nothing happened for a long time and then about a month ago, maybe
6</b>
<br><b>weeks ago, I was sitting at my computer and went to get in a more</b>
<br><b>comfortable position in my chair, which involved leaning forward
for a</b>
<br><b>moment.&nbsp; As soon as my back left the back of the chair, I felt
a hand on</b>
<br><b>my shoulder.&nbsp; Just for a split second, but I knew what it was.&nbsp;
Of</b>
<br><b>course I was terrified, nobody was there.&nbsp; I could feel someone
in the</b>
<br><b>room, but I didn't know who or what it was.&nbsp; The next day,
I went</b>
<br><b>outside to read because it was nice outside and I was very cold
inside.</b>
<br><b>I was reading my book on western philosophy, sitting on the ground
about</b>
<br><b>5 feet from a retaining wall.&nbsp; For some reason or another,
I looked over</b>
<br><b>to the ledge and knew he was sitting there, watching me read.&nbsp;
I've</b>
<br><b>never seen him, but I know he's a he, and he was smiling.&nbsp;
I just...know</b>
<br><b>these things.</b>
<br><b>I was getting kindof freaked out about the whole thing so I talked
to a</b>
<br><b>friend of mine about it, she's interested in these types of things.</b>
<br><b>While we were talking, she suddenly asked me if my parents had ever</b>
<br><b>miscarried any children before me.&nbsp; I said yes, and just as
I was</b>
<br><b>answering it, I felt him walk into the room.&nbsp; He didn't do
anything,</b>
<br><b>just walked in.&nbsp; He seems to be a little older than me, which
supports</b>
<br><b>that theory.&nbsp; My dad built our house when I was born because
the other</b>
<br><b>one was too small for us.&nbsp; Since then, I haven't felt his presence.&nbsp;
I</b>
<br><b>sortof miss him actually.&nbsp; I was starting to feel comfortable
around</b>
<br><b>him.</b>
<br><b>If anyone has any opinions, please let me know..</b>

<br><b>night i would here noises like someone was walking around the house
so i</b>
<br><b>started keeping my bedroom door closed.&nbsp; after about a month
of this, i saw</b>
<br><b>the ghost in my bedroom.&nbsp; i was lying in bed reading about
11pm when i saw a</b>
<br><b>long white light out of the corner of my eye.&nbsp; i looked straight
ahead for a</b>
<br><b>few seconds and then looked directly at it and it had disapeared.&nbsp;
i was a</b>
<br><b>little spooked since this was actually my first sighting of a ghost(i
have</b>
<br><b>been able to feel them for a long time), so i stayed still and went
back to</b>
<br><b>reading.&nbsp; it happened again on the other side of the bed and
it was a smaller</b>
<br><b>ball of light that disapeared when i looked right at it.&nbsp; i
was a little</b>
<br><b>confused because i couldn't feel it the way i had with other ghosts(
i assume</b>
<br><b>that's because it wasn't very strong).&nbsp; after that, i had no
more sightings</b>
<br><b>but still occasionally heard things at night, especially on the
front porch</b>
<br><b>it sounded like someone pacing late at night.&nbsp; a few months
later i was</b>
<br><b>moving things into the storage room that had been converted from
a side</b>
<br><b>porch, when there was a large red wasp flying around and i decided
to wait a</b>
<br><b>while before moving anything else in because i'm allergic to their
stings and</b>
<br><b>didn't want to take any chances.&nbsp; about an hour later i went
back in to see</b>
<br><b>if it had gotten out the way it had gotten in.&nbsp; i didn't see
it anywhere at</b>
<br><b>first.&nbsp; then i looked up on the ceiling and it was smashed.&nbsp;
there was no one</b>
<br><b>else in the house with me at the time and the ceiling is very high.&nbsp;
i was</b>
<br><b>startled of course and said thank you.&nbsp; the last time anything
has happened</b>
<br><b>was when my husband spent the night.&nbsp; he and i have been seperated
for a</b>
<br><b>while and we were thinking about getting back together.&nbsp; he
had never spent</b>
<br><b>the night before here and said he was thrown in the floor from the
bed about</b>
<br><b>5am.&nbsp; i didn't even wake up.&nbsp; i asked the woman who lived
here before me if</b>
<br><b>she noticed anything strange going on.&nbsp; she said she had, but
she's very</b>
<br><b>religious and doesn't believe in ghosts and would pray when anything
strange</b>
<br><b>would happen.&nbsp; she wouldn't elaborate on any of her experiences.&nbsp;
i don't</b>
<br><b>feel uncomfortable here like i have in the past with other haunted
places</b>
<br><b>i've lived.&nbsp; it's nice knowing i have a protector.</b>

<br><b>&nbsp;Chilly Trip To the Cemetery</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: LAURENZPAUL@prodigy.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>It was half hour past midnight, my friends(2), a cousin of mine,
and I were all</b>
<br><b>bored, we all just got off from work, Dawn, a friend of ours told
us about an</b>
<br><b>eerie experience she and her boyfriend had while passing by this
cemetery</b>
<br><b>in our town(Williston,FL)---I'm just wondering if it could be the
same one on your</b>
<br><b>list, yet, i'm not pretty sure since you had made no mention of
which cemetery.</b>
<br><b>Ok, going back to my story... so, all four of us went to the nearest
store for</b>
<br><b>our midnight snacks, we happened to joke about going to the cemetery
just for</b>
<br><b>thrills but instead we were spooked!!! My cousin Wenz was driving,
I was seated at</b>
<br><b>the back with our friend Anne and Dawn was seated in the front passenger's
seat...</b>
<br><b>Our car was driving perfectly fine until we got inside the cemetery,
all of a sudden the car felt sooooo COLD, it was&nbsp; pretty humid all
day and night-THAT NIGHT, so</b>
<br><b>we started to freak out, the car was somewhat experiencing some
problems and</b>
<br><b>the car stereo was having some static reception... I was soooo scared!
We all tried</b>
<br><b>to calm down and while Wenz was carefully driving around the cemetery,
we</b>
<br><b>had goosebumps all over and we somewhat saw some mist in the area
which was</b>
<br><b>matter of fact, strange, we all had this creepy feeling that there
were some presence watching us... we drove off as fast as&nbsp; we can,
we never went back there</b>
<br><b>too, we were all spooked , it sure was a spooky and scary experience!!!</b>

<br><b>&nbsp;Cat's Meow</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: JasperSimms@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>My story isn't as elaborate or shocking as some I have read so far.&nbsp;
I have to say, some of these stories have chilled me to the bone. In April
of '93, my husband and I were asleep in our room with my cat at the foot
of our bed.&nbsp; I was pregnant at the time&nbsp; with our daughter.&nbsp;
The cat had awaken me.&nbsp; I sat up and saw the cat was being taunted,
teased, and chased by a transparent orb.&nbsp; The cat's meow was chilling
and it scared me.&nbsp; I tried to wake my husband but for some odd reason
he wouldn't wake up.&nbsp; I found it kind of funny him being a light sleeper
and all.&nbsp; After the orb disappeared, my husband finally awoke and
told me he was dreaming that I was trying to wake him up but he couldn't
open his eyes or move.&nbsp; I explained to him that I was trying to wake
him up but he wouldn't.&nbsp; 2 months later, my husband passed away.&nbsp;
I was 7 months pregnant.&nbsp; 2 months later, I gave birth to our daughter
on my husbands birthday.&nbsp; When I had arrived home, I was playing a
cassette tape that we both enjoyed and I had skipped one of the songs that
he played for me all the time because I wasn't ready to listen to it.&nbsp;
I pressed fast forward to the next song and went into the bathroom to curl
my hair.&nbsp; As I put the curling iron into my hair, some how, the tape
had rewound itself and our song was playing.&nbsp; I didn't know wether
to laugh or cry so I let the song play, twice.&nbsp; It rewound itself
again and played a second time.</b>

<br><b>A STory For your Chills</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: brandeec@nslp.org</b><b></b>
<p><b>I think I posted this one on the message board by mistake.&nbsp;
I wanted it</b>
<br><b>added to the stories about hauntings.&nbsp; Of course this really
happened to me</b>
<br><b>but after reading on your website for the last couple of days I
decided I</b>
<br><b>would share one of my experiences too.&nbsp; thanks.</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have had several "unexplained experiences" during my 26 years,
but none</b>
<br><b>have been so frightening as the night I spent in a house on Washington</b>
<br><b>Street.&nbsp; I live in Lincoln NE and have all my life.&nbsp; If
you'd like a good</b>
<br><b>book about my area read The Ghosts of Lincoln (I can't remember
the authors</b>
<br><b>name)&nbsp; Anyway, my best friend had been asked to babysit for
one of her</b>
<br><b>sister's co-workers.&nbsp; She lived in the ground floor apartment
of an old</b>
<br><b>colonial style house on 23rd &amp; Washington Street.&nbsp; There
were 2 kids, an</b>
<br><b>older girl and a younger boy.&nbsp; I want to say at the time they
were maybe 6</b>
<br><b>and 3...Anyway, the house was kind of creepy to begin with, it was
dark blue</b>
<br><b>and surrounded by bushes and trees that made it very ominous from
the street</b>
<br><b>when we pulled up.&nbsp; The Mom was working the late shift for
a friend and we</b>
<br><b>arrived there right about dusk.&nbsp; (it was late summer because
I remember it</b>
<br><b>was very hot in the evening but it didn't get dark until about 10)&nbsp;
I think</b>
<br><b>we must have arrived at around 7 o'clock.&nbsp; We went in the side
door, which</b>
<br><b>was the main entrance to the apartment, there was a small entry
then a</b>
<br><b>living area with a large stone fireplace and wooden mantel with
lots of</b>
<br><b>family pictures and a pair of really pretty hurricane lamps.&nbsp;
I first sensed</b>
<br><b>something strange when the Mom left.&nbsp; I saw her out the door
while my friend</b>
<br><b>Heather talked with the children.&nbsp; While I watched the Mom
get in her car I</b>
<br><b>felt the back of my neck get all tingly and the hair stood up on
my arm and</b>
<br><b>my neck.&nbsp; It was chilly, I chalked it up to just coming into
an</b>
<br><b>air-conditioned place from the heat and dismissed it.&nbsp; We decided
to play</b>
<br><b>Candyland with the kids in their bedroom which was directly off
the main</b>
<br><b>living area.&nbsp; In their bedroom was a mirror that went from
the floor to the</b>
<br><b>ceiling, I remember thinking it was kind of cool at first, at first,
until I</b>
<br><b>saw something in it that I will never forget.&nbsp; Heather was
in the kitchen</b>
<br><b>fixing popcorn and I was sitting on the floor with the kids playing
the</b>
<br><b>game.&nbsp; I turned to yell at Heather that it was her turn when
out of the</b>
<br><b>corner of my eye I saw something in the mirror that made me gasp!&nbsp;
There was</b>
<br><b>something black standing behind me!&nbsp; It freaked me out so bad
I immediately</b>
<br><b>stood up and jerked around only to see nothing but the wall with
a crucifix</b>
<br><b>hanging on it.&nbsp; The kids looked at me kind of funny and I just
dismissed it.</b>
<br><b>Later on that evening I decided I needed to take a shower.&nbsp;
Now the bathroom</b>
<br><b>was at the front of the house and the window was actually the old
front</b>
<br><b>window of the house.&nbsp; It looked out to the front porch which
was one of</b>
<br><b>those old covered types.&nbsp; Anyway I locked the door, shut the
blind on the</b>
<br><b>window and got in the shower.&nbsp; I was washing my hair when suddenly
the light</b>
<br><b>went off.&nbsp; I screamed, Heather came to the door and tried to
open it but it</b>
<br><b>was locked from the inside.&nbsp; I was terrified to open the shower
curtain</b>
<br><b>because I just knew that black thing was there!&nbsp; I finally
got up the</b>
<br><b>courage to reach my hand out to open the blinds and let some light
in..when</b>
<br><b>I did, there was nothing there, but the old push button switch was
in the</b>
<br><b>"off" position and Heather was still knocking on the door.&nbsp;
When I opened</b>
<br><b>the door she was standing behind a card table that had been leaned
up</b>
<br><b>against the door.&nbsp; I remember her standing there with her hands
on her hips</b>
<br><b>wanting to know why I had moved the table out of the kitchen and
into the</b>
<br><b>hall like that?&nbsp; I think she must have realized what was going
on because</b>
<br><b>she got really pale and started backing up out of the hallway.&nbsp;
I couldn't</b>
<br><b>believe this was happening...I quickly got dressed and went into
the living</b>
<br><b>room.&nbsp; It was getting dark out and time for the kids to go
to bed so I let</b>
<br><b>Heather put them down (I wasn't going back into that room) The kids
had been</b>
<br><b>asleep for awhile and we were watching TV in the living room.&nbsp;
I was sitting</b>
<br><b>in a recliner that backed to the small front entry way.&nbsp; I
started getting</b>
<br><b>that feeling again.&nbsp; This time I mentioned it to Heather.&nbsp;
We sat there for</b>
<br><b>a moment, then we both thought we could hear people talking...it
was coming</b>
<br><b>from seemingly the entryway.&nbsp; "Maybe she's home early" But
we weren't</b>
<br><b>expecting her home until almost 3 in the morning.&nbsp; No it was
the damn ghost</b>
<br><b>again because as we sat there, one of those beautiful hurricane
lamps came</b>
<br><b>crashing to the floor, right off the mantel, and I know it had to
have been</b>
<br><b>at least a foot away from the edge of the wood.&nbsp; That did it,
I told Heather</b>
<br><b>I was outta there! She wouldn't let me though.&nbsp; "theres no
way you're</b>
<br><b>leaving me here alone and we can't leave those kids"&nbsp; So we
ended up turning</b>
<br><b>every light in the place on until the Mom came back at 3.&nbsp;
We left</b>
<br><b>immediately, we almost forgot to get paid we were in such a hurry
to get out</b>
<br><b>of there.&nbsp; We told her about the lamp that had fallen trying
not to let on</b>
<br><b>that it was mysterious in nature but I think she knew because she
said that</b>
<br><b>it had happened to other things she had up there before.&nbsp; Anyway,
that was</b>
<br><b>about 10 years ago.&nbsp; I never mention that night to Heather,
although we are</b>
<br><b>still very good friends.&nbsp; Sometime I will drive by the house
just for kicks</b>
<br><b>and it still give me the heeby geebys just the same.&nbsp; There
are some other</b>
<br><b>stories that I have but we'll save those for another time!&nbsp;
ciao!</b>
