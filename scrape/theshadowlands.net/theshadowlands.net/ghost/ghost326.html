coming towards me!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Just as I screamed my
dad opened the door, I ran and jumped into the bed telling my parents what
happened.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My dad went to get his gun
from the closet and ran out of the room.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>When he came back he looked puzzled and said that there were leaves in
the foyer and the front door was wide open.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>

the door it was not locked he just turned the knob.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>My
husband and I lived at at this house for one year and had several experiences.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Our
apartment covered two floors, the 3rd and 4th.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The living area, kitchen, etc was on the 3rd floor, bathroom and 2
bedrooms on 4th floor.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It started
slowly, like after I had gone to bed, my husband would think that I was awake
because he heard someone walking outside of the bedroom.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>The
TV and clock radio would turn on or off by itself, sometimes change
stations.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The bathroom door would
sometimes open by itself.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>One
time after getting out of the shower, there was an 3 dimensional image in the
mirror of a man in a sports coat.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You
can't see a face, but you can make out the shoulders, the lapel, and even that
one button is buttoned.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I am attaching a
picture that we took.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It's hard to make
out because it's a mirror, but you can see that it isn't something that we
could draw on the mirror ourselves.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>One
time I felt, what I thought was my husband sneaking into bed as to not disturb
me.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I felt the weight of his body behind
me, and then the weight of his arm over my waist just holding me.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My heart was racing, like I'd never felt
before.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I reached my leg back to touch
him, and everything vanished instantly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Another
time, my husband was getting ready to come upstairs to bed and thought that I
was trying to scare him by the stairs, so he slowly creep up the stairs.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When he got to the top, he saw a large black
shadow hovering at the top of the stairs, then it vanished in front of
him.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He saw that shadow again at the
foot of our bed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>When
I told my daughter, who was out of state at college, that my husband had seen
something, she said &quot;we all knew something was there, it's about time that
we saw it.&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The next time that she
came home, she saw it out of the corner of her eye.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>When
we moved out of the apartment, we had two last trips to the truck, and when we
went to get the last box, the door was locked.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>

there is a big river going through the park. so me and my friends were just
walking along the river and there was a bench. 2 of my friends got tired so
they sat on the bench there. me and this other friend we just started walking
further. there was like this dock on the river so me and my friend walked on
there. and we started waving to our friends. then all of a sudden we saw this
normal looking boy sitting next to them with blue jeans on, a baseball cap and
a shirt on. then we walked back. and we asked our friends who that guy was but
they said that there was never a guy there. and me and my friend both saw this
guy. and the funny thing is, is that there is a cemetary right next to the
park.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

remember when I was young, around 9 or 10 year's old, I used to hear somebody
playing basketball around 3 or 4 in the morning. I would hear them say things
like &quot;give me the ball, give me the ball&quot;I would wake up to the
sound, and I would look outside and the yard would be empty with no one, or a
lot of times, I would hear something dribbling the basketball around our house,
I would wake up and nothing would be there, it was just really strange. I was
not scared but I wanted to know what was going on. This happened at least four
or five times a week. As best as I can remember, this only happened in the
summer. One time, my older brother told me that he heard the same dribbling
also, and he told me that the dribbling stopped in front of his window to his
bedroom. He felt like someone was trying to get in thru the window, so he
opened the curtain really fast, and nothing was there. very strange!!! I dont
know why it was basketball noises that we heard, if anybody has had anything
like this happen to them, let me know, thanks<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I
grew up in Suburban IL and have had a great many experiences throughout my life
(currently 24).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As a child (5-10), I had
many experiences seeing floating faces/heads in my parents' house.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>One night, I woke up around 1:00 am.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Whenever I would wake up in the middle of the
night, I would walk over to my parents' bedroom to get back to sleep (I felt
safter there).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Our bedrooms were all on
the second floor.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As I walked to their
bedroom, I noticed a white object over the staircase floating at about my
height.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I wasn't sure what I was seeing,
so I walked down the staircase to see what it was.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I looked up at it and saw nothing but a floating
white cloud.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>At this point I realized
that I could see through it and nothing was holding it up.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I ran screaming to my parents' room.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Another
time I was sleeping over at my cousin's house (about age 12).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I was always the last to fall asleep, and I
hated it since I was always scared of the dark.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>An hour or so after everyone else fell asleep (two cousins, one brother,
aunt/uncle in another room), I heard the backdoor (along with the screen door)
open and close.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I heard several people
walk into the house talking loudly (although I couldn't make out what they were
saying). <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>They all walked into the room
we were sleeping in and continued to talk and otherwise make lots of
noise.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I hid under the blankets until
the noise stopped.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I never slept over
there again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

name is Caryn, and I live in a small town on the coast of North Carolina.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I have always been sensitive to paranormal
occurances.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It began when I was small,
and my imaginary friend was actually my mother's cousin, who had died nearly 12
or more years earlier, I told her his name, what he looked like, how he
died-everything.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That was just the
beginning, then when I was about 13 we moved into the home my grandfather grew
up in.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My house is between 80 and 90
years old, my grandfather and his 13 brothers and sisters grew up there.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My great-grandfather actually died in what
now is our living room.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My sisters and
have experienced many creepy things.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Take me, I have actually seen my great-grandfather standing over
me.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I was sleeping on the couch in the
living room-in the exact place where he died- and suddenly I woke up saying
something odd, and as my eyes began to adjust to the light in the room, I saw
the apparition of my great-grandfather.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>He looked exactly like he did in the picture of him we have hanging in
our entrance way.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He actually looked
multi-colored, like when the TV scrambles and you see all sorts of colors.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When I was fully awake, he disappeared.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Another time, I was sitting in my kitchen
floor, petting my cat.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I had a
wife-beater in my hand, and I felt a cold breeze behind me, when I looked up,
my shirt was floating in mid-air.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Needless to say, I was absolutly terrified, but I actually stood there
trying to rationalize what had just happened!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I also don't like to be alone in my house at night, especially if i have
to go upstairs.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It's not that I feel
unsafe, but I always feel like someone is directly behind me, breathing o my
neck.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>My
sister lived with us with her son for a year, while her husband was away at
boot-camp.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Her son was maybe between 1 or
2, and we constantly heard soft humming coming from his room when we put him to
bed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He would sit in the hallway,
staring at the wall laughing and babbling to someone he called Big Mama.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We asked my grandfather about it, and he said
they always used to call his mother Big Mama.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>No one had ever told any of us that, and we definitely didn't tell my
nephew about it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>While they lived with
us, My sister was really screwed around with.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>She went to the kitchen late one night to get a drink, and when she opened
the freezer to get some ice, she heard the sound of what she described as a
womans high heels, like they wore in the 40's-bigger clunky heels-and the
footsteps stopped at the edge of the kitchen door, and then directly behind my
sister, she heard in a whispered voice, &quot;sshhh, hush.&quot;<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She ran out of the kitchen, leaving the
fridge open, and jumped on the couch where my mom was sleeping.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She also was always awakened to a woman's
voice softly calling out her name.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>One
night she had gotten fed up with being woken up, and she sat up in bed and said
&quot;great-grandma, please let me sleep, just please let me go to
sleep.&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>From that night on, she
never heard her name being called again.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>It's
not only the family that get messed with, it's our friends too.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Once, my sister's boyfriend stayed the night,
and slept on the couch where my Uncle Tal had always slept before he passed
away.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Lee-the boyfriend-kept on having
his feet thrown off of the couch; being in the middle of sleep, he didn't
really reguard it as anything, until he really woke up to his feet being held
up in the air and his legs being twisted back and forth.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My college roommate recently came home with
me, and slept in one of the rooms upstairs.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It used to be my om, but that room never ever got warm, even in the
summer, when the upstairs of our old house is blistering hot, it remains
cool.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Anyway, she woke up in the middle
of the night to see a man laying on the floor with his hands behind his head.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He never moved, but he just stared at
her.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When he disappeared, she got up a
turned on the lights, and slept with them on for the rest of the night.<span

stories, and believe me, these are true.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I wouldn't have spent so much time typing them out if they were
fake.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I love the fact that our house is
haunted, I feel piveledged!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And it seems
that everytime one of my grandfather's brothers or sisters pass away, our house
receives more activity!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They are all

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I
have had four dreams of airline disasters which have come true.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The first two were over a period of about one
year.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I would have a terrible dream that
I was onboard a stricken airliner, falling to the ground, or crashing on
landing.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Both times the dreams struck me
as unusual.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Very real and the terror was
palpable.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Both times I awoke the next
morning and heard that a major airline disaster had indeed happened overnight
as I slept.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>At this stage, after it
happening twice, I began to tell other people about it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Years
later at University, I had told my friends about these two dreams, when a third
one occured.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>These were never the same
dream by the way, always different situations, places etc.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If I had any details from the dreams such as
an airline or a city, these were never accurate.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What was always the same was this feeling
that came with them.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Real terror.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As if I crashed with them myself.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This third dream occured and I turned on the
radio after waking expecting to hear about the disaster, but there was nothing
on the news at all.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I was quite relieved
that the other two occasions must have been just an amazing coincidence.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Later
that day, about 4 pm, I was listening to the radio when I heard an ad for the
news that night saying they had pictures of America's worst ever airline
disaster, which had occured about mid-morning our time.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When I heard this I just about fell over.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

fourth dream involved me.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I was overseas
in Germany with a group of school students when I dreamt that we were coming in
to land in Australia and I was sitting a little past half way along the 747
three seats away from the left hand window on the aisle.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We hit the runway very hard on landing, so
hard, that all the passengers gasped.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We
stopped and then I somehow looked out a window on the otherside of the
aircraft, about two rows in front of mine, and I saw vehicles driving under the
wing.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In the morning, I knew that this
was &quot;one of those dreams&quot; because it had that funny feeling to it,
but I knew it wasn't about doom and death.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I assumed that we had landed on a freeway.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Two
weeks later, we are coming in to land in Brisbane, our first touchdown back in
Australia, and I am sitting in the seat from my dream.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Jumbo is being tossed about like a toy,
and as we bank, I see Moreton Bay is white with foam from what must be VERY
strong winds.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is not going to be
pretty I think to myself, and I tighten my seatbelt a little more.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We slam into the runway, and all passengers
gasp with surprise.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The pilot applys no
braking force however and we scream along the runway for a few seconds.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then the brakes are slammed on, causing
everyone to gasp a second time.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We then
come to a complete halt and the engines are turned off as we still sit on the
runway itself.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Something's up here.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>One of the students from my group is sitting
at the window from my dream on the other side of the aircraft.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He is pointing out the window and saying,
&quot;Fire&quot;.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I was about to jump
out the nearest window we he said &quot;Fire-engines&quot;.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Apparently, a front brake had overhea<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>ted
and set off a fire alarm and all the emergency vehicles were driving under and
around that wing o<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I
have had strange things happening to me since I was 6 years old. Probably
longer than that but I dont remember. I have talked about them to very few
people but reading the stories on your sight made me want to share mine. Just so
you know, I am not crazy. Im a very down to earth, 24 year old, working mother.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>The
first experience I remember was when I lived in NC as a small child. I was in
first grade, a little dramatic, as most girls are, but not one to make things
up.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I was in bed one night, sleeping
like a baby, and I was awoke by a noise. When I woke up I could here the
drawers on my bedside table opening and closing. Of course I was terrified and
tried to scream for my mommy, but no sound would come out. I kept trying to scream
for what seemed like forever although Im sure it was only a few minutes. I
guess I must have fell back asleep from terror and exhaustion because I woke
the next morning and everything was fine. I told my parents, and they thought I
was dreaming. I accepted that.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Several
years later, still in NC but in another town and home I was awoke again in the
middle of the night. This time I hear what sounds like loud satanic music
coming from the basement. I also hear a dog barking (we dont have a dog, nor do
any of our neighbors) and the sound of chains being drug up the wooden steps
going into the basement. I assume that my parents have lost their minds, and I
get up to find out whats going on and to tell them to be quiet. . For some
reason I go straight to my parents room instead of opening the basement door.
Thank god for that because they are in bed fast asleep aparently not hearing
any of this. By this time all of the noise has stopped. I wake my mom and she
calms me and I fall asleep in her bed. Once again I am convinced that I am
dreaming.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Nothing
memorable happens again until I have met my husband and we are living in
Jackson Co, WV. There were little things over the years but nothing that stands
out to me now. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>We
had lived in this house for almost 2 years when strange things started
happening.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Every morning a little after
4 am the phone would ring one and a half times. Nothing registered on the
caller id and if I dialed *69 it would be the last number that had called the
night before. If by some chance I answered it, it was a dial tone.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Every morning when I was in the shower
someone would knock on the bathroom door. For awhile I blamed this on my
husband or my daughter but soon realized they were both to lazy to get out of
bed at 6 am to play a joke on me. I tried not closing the door but then felt
like someone was watching me. My daughters toys would start talking at night on
their own and it was too often to be batteries going dead. I had a home
interior mirror hanging in my living room that fell on numerous occasions.
Granted it was heavy, but the nails were always still in the wall and nothing
was bent. This was all very creepy but nothing to get to excited about. A few
months after all of this starts to die down, I wake one night to see my husband
standing in front of the window as if he is staring outside. I speak his name
and reach out to him and he steps back without turning to me and vanishes. I
sit up and in doing so realize that he is lying beside of me asleep. In a
panic, I wake him up. He can tell that I am scared to death and it scares him
too. We check on our daughter and she is fine but we still dont go back to
sleep. To be honest I didnt sleep for quite a while after that. This time I
knew that I wasnt dreaming.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Everything
is quiet for a few months, and I have put all of this in the back of my mind. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Then,<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I am lying in bed one night fast asleep and I
wake up to this loud humming in my head. I cant move a muscle, and I cant make
a sound. I can feel that my hand is on my husbands leg and I try to squeeze or
pinch or anything to wake him but I am paralyzed by something. This is when I
think, Oh my god, Im dying. It felt like everything was fading far away. I
could open my eyes but it was too dark to see anything.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I fought this with everything inside of me
and eventually I felt a pop, like a seal breaking inside my head and all senses
came back to me. I was hysterical. There was nothing anyone could do to calm
me. I was scared to death to go back to sleep. I didnt not associate this with
anything paranormal. I thought that something was physically wrong with
me.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Even after several check ups I still
didnt believe I was ok because their had to be an explanation for what
happened. Then I visit this web site and I read a story by a boy who has had
this happen to him. He calls this expereince &quot;Pe Um&quot;, I think. I dont
understand what it means but I know it sounds like<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>what happened to me. It has not happened
again and that was over 3 years ago. I hope that it never happens again!!! We
have moved to a new home and we are the first family to live in it. So
hopefully there is no presence that I can attract, because I really feel that
it has something to do with my personally. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>If
you have any information on &quot;Pe Um&quot; please share it with me. Also, is
it possible that the same spirit was causing all of these things in all of the
different places Ive lived? I would like to try to understand a little better
what might have been happening.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Hi,
my name is Alex, and it was about 7 year ago I had my first supernatural
experience with earthbound spirits. It was around 3am (I'm not sure about that)
when I would wake up to find a figure of a woman standing at my bedroom's door.
With long hairs covering part of her face, she was looking straight at my eyes.
I got startled in bed and the only action I thought I was able to take was to
scream. So I tried but at the same time I opened my mouth to give it a scream
she, the figure, just reached out her right hand with the arm supernaturally
outstretched and held tight my neck. At this time my whole body was trembling
out of control and I just could use one thing as an weapon at those frightening
and endless seconds: &quot;namely, my mind&quot;. And I did. I thought: &quot;
Oh God! Please drive this woman out of my room!! help me please, help me
please!!&quot;... So oddly enough, the figure roared in a loud voice and fled
away from my room, after had her left eye stared upon my head (the right eye
was covered). After that my room was filled with a supernatural light and I
started feeling peace. So the light was fading out and I fell asleep again.
From this day on, neither the figure nor other spirits has appeared to me at
any part of the house...(thanx God!!).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'><span

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Hi,
my name is Kaitlyn, and I love ghost stories. Though I have never experienced a
haunting that I am aware of, I would like to share a story that my mom told me
about.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>When
my mom was in tenth or eleventh grade, she had a good friend named Dick Hatch.
One weekend, Dick and a few of his friends decided to go swimming in a stone
quarry.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Dick
and his friends were having a great time, until Dick slipped on a rock and fell
in the water. He hit his head on a rock and was unconscious, so he drowned.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Later
that night, the news was out that Dick Hatch had died. When my mom found out,
she and her boyfriend decided to go to the funeral. They went, and later
decided to bring back some flowers for Dick's grave. They drove around in the
cemetary for a long time, trying to find Dick's resting place. Then, all of a
sudden, standing about ten feet away behind a bush, they saw Dick, smiling
happily. He yelled,&quot;Hey!&quot;, and disappeared. My mom's boyfriend looked
at her. &quot;Who did you just see?&quot; my mom asked, in complete shock. My
mom's boyfriend, dumbfounded answered,&quot;Dick Hatch.&quot; My mom agreed.
They drove the ten feet where the ghost of Dick Hatch stood, to find his grave.
<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>This
story is not scary, but I felt chilled when my mom tole it to me. I am
thirteen, and I have never experienced anything like this, but I think that in
everyone's life, if even just once, everyone will meet a ghost.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Over
the past couple of years I have began to have more and more experiance. I have
always been interested in paranormal activities. As a child I have felt sprits
around me. But there are two recent events that have kept in my mind.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>About
a two weeks ago I had the opportunity to baby-sit my friends little girl. The
night before my friend told me that she feels uncomfortable in her house. She
told me that at night the baby will cry in her sleep, but when the pick her up
she continues to sleep.I did not feel anything and thought that may the baby is
just being a baby, so I just brushed her off. The next day while babysitting, I
had just put the baby down for a nap I laid down next to her so I could take
one too. As we laid there her leap frog toy started to sing. I thought that it
was what the new toy, the type that go off to let you know to turn it off. The
toy would go off every 3 minutes. The third time the baby was getting upset so
I sang with the toy, when that song ended it began to repeat over and over
again with out stopping. At the same time the room temperature dropped and I
had goose bumps all over my body not to mention my hair stood up. All of the
sudden it all stopped and I was my friend walking up to the house. My friend
later informed me that they often hear footsteps go up and down the stairs and
something playing with the toys at night when the baby is in bed with them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>My
second experience was late one night. I have to tell about my house to explain.
I live in a cottage behind my parents house (I am still in college). My parents
house was the second house build next to the original house built in the
1930's, which is falling apart so bad that we can not walk in it. At the time I
had just moved in to the cottage and did not have a frig. At night I would walk
to my parents house to get things to drink and eat. I had been up late studying
at about 12 pm I went to go get some thing to drink. On the way over there I
heard my mother calling me &quot;nat-nat&quot;. I stood under her window and
yelled &quot;what&quot;. She did not answer me. So I went inside to the
kitchen, poured a glass of juice<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>and I
heard my mother again. I walked down the hall, into her room and asked her what
she wanted. She told me that the did not call me, and I told her not to lie to
me (we are good friends). I asked my dad if she was telling the truth and he
said yes. I walked out thing to myself that I need to go to bed and sleep. As I
walked by the old house I heard a lady call my name &quot;natalie&quot; in the
most haunting way. She said it in the way that someone would do to scare a
friend. I know it was not me and not my mother. so who was it?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>As
far as I know we have two ghost in the house. A lady in a old fashion night
gown- see by my father, and a young little boy who was killed by a car driven
by his grandpa who did not see him backing up (we have neighbor who knew the
family before us). The boy is seen by my mom and children. He makes himself
known when he plays with toys.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>reason
what so ever. We had queen size mattress laid on the ground next to <o:p></o:p></span></p>

My father's mother died when I was 1 year-old after a long 5 year battle of brest
cancer. Since I was too young to remember her, I often asked questions about
her. I was told she was a very sweet woman who cared greatly and loved her
children and grandchildren. She worked hard her whole life and supported her
two kids and husband. My father joined the Air Force right after High School
and left all of his childhood pictures behind. My grandfather wasn't a very
nice man, who has recently deceased. After my grandmother died, my family never
made a visit to see my grandfather or even visit the home where my father grew
up. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>My father was station at an Air Force Base
in Anchorage, Alaska and I was the youngest of four children. I believe I was 4
or 5 when this incident occurred. We were living on military housing and woke
up one cold morning. My mother was the first one awake and walked into the
dining room to find an old picture of a toddler sitting on a catch surrounded
by Mickey Mouse stuffed &quot;dolls&quot; laying right on top of the table. My
mother asked all of us kids where the picture came from but no one had a clue.
We were all puzzled. My father came into the dining room and my mother asked
him. He recognized the picture right away and said that was a picture of him as
young child. My father loved anything to do with Mickey Mouse as a child. He
hadn't seen that picture since he left home and no one could explain where it
came from. According to us, all of my fathers pictures from his childhood still
remained in the house he grew up in, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>I believe my grandmother visited us that
night. This incident in no way scares me and I often embrace it and cherish it.
I like the fact she still hangs around. I often hope she will do something like
that again. Maybe she does and I just don't realize it. I come from a very spiritual
family when it comes to stuff like this and we are very open minded to these
situations. We still have the picture to this day framed in our living room. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span>Sometimes, I still get real weird feelings
that she's still around or something is hanging around. This may sound funny
but I'll be blowing drying my hair and flip it around to almost see a figure of
something looking at me. I often get this feeling when I'm taking a bath of
shower. I seem to have inherited something from my living grandmother and
mother. My mother has done Tarot readings for almost 15 years now and my
grandmother does charts for people.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>As
a child I use to make my mother set a place at the table for &quot;my
friends.&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Or she would find me
talking to my &quot;my friends.&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As
I got older I know things before they will happen, I know when the phone is
gong to ring, I get physically sick when something really bad is about to

finally told my husband after a year of marriage and he replied &quot;oh
right&quot; and would laugh when things would &quot;happen.&quot;<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I have a few stories that I would like to
share with you...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>After
we moved into our new house, my son had his own room.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He was only 3 years old and would wake in the
middle of the night crying and come to our room.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I new the reason and would let him come to
our bed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My husband would just say he
was not use to being in his own room.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Finally one night I asked my son to explain what was happening.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He explained that Grandpa would wake him and
ask him to play, but he could see through him and that was scary and he was to
tired to play.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My husband ask him to
describe the man to him, and he described my husbands late grandpa, in his
suit, that he was buried in.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My husbands
grandfather had died 4 years ago and we rarely spoke of him because it was hard
for my husband because they were extremely close.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So we didn't know how my son new curtain
details of him.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A few nights later my
son came to our room again.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I looked at
my husband and explained to him to go in our sons room and tell [him] that it
is nice that he is here and wants to know our son but he is scaring him and to
stop.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My husband giggled and walked down
the hall.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I heard him talking and then
he came back to bed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I asked him what he
said and he just said go to sleep.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>From
that day on my son has not woken up because of Grandpa again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I
don't have any memory of this night but was told by my husband..<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>One
night my husband said he came to bed and it was cold in our room, so he crawled
into be and began to cuddle with me.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He
said I had a weird look in my eyes and was talking alittle funny but he thought
I was joking with him.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He says that I
began to kiss him &quot;differently&quot; than I usually did.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And he got a strange feeling.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So he keep asking &quot;Kris what's wrong
with you?&quot; and I wouldn't answer.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>So he got out of bed and went to the couch.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The next morning I woke up sick.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He asked me what was wrong with me last night
and I said why.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And he told me what happened.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That night we went to bed together and he
awoke 2 hours later to the vacuum running.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>He walked to the front room and turned it off.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Thinking the cat must have turned it on.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He walked back into the bedroom to see a
&quot;red light&quot; next to my side of the bed.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And he said he bursted out &quot;LEAVE&quot;
and it vanished.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>After
talking about it later we think that someone or something was in my body that
night.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Growing
up I was best friends with my grandmother we were very close. This year she got
very sick.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She ended up in the hospital
for months.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Getting better then getting
sick again.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>The
doctors didn't know what to do, so after a long discussion on what to do,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>They
brought my grandmother home from the hospital to allow her to die on her
own.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The doctors explained that she
could live weeks or days depending on her body.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>The
day she came home all the family gathered to look at pictures and listen to her
favorite music and just to be at her side.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The home nurse brought in an oxygen tank and said that when it was gone
to just take the mask off and that would be it, then it would be up to her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>So
after a few hours of crying, laughing and remembering my sister had a late
night MRI to go to so my Mom decided I needed a break so I should go with
them.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>On our way to the hospital we
noticed that a storm was moving in (that's a whole other story about that) and
my Mom said &quot;Here comes grandpa to take grandma&quot; and laughed.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>After the appointment we came back to my grandmothers
home and a few members of our family had left.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I went into her room and my sister was at her side and I stood
there.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My grandma opened her eyes and
stared into mine.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And this is what I
heard..&quot;I love you so much and I will miss you.. Please let me go.&quot;
With her not speaking a word. I heard several other voices also. So I bent down
and removed her oxygen mask.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I turned to
my uncle and said that's it right.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And
he nodded.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A few moments later my
grandmother stopped breathing and I panicked and my uncle said its all right
she's been doing that all night and she began breathing again.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I went out of the room crying and I told my
sister to go get my aunt so she could tell grandma good-bye.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My aunt came back and freaked out at me
because my sister told her that grandma had died.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We yelled back and forth and when out side to
get in my car and leave to get away.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I
started my car my husband came out and yelled to me.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When I open the door to ask him what he said
that she had died. I went back into the house and my aunt came and hugged me
and whisper thank you because she wouldn't have been here, and she was
sorry.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I walk into her room and she was
gone.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She looked so peace full and I
fell to my knees next to her and sobbed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I grabbed her hand and I could hear her saying thank you.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I feel grateful that she asked me to let her
go.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>When
I was in high school I worked for a couple of years at a shabby old historic
movie theater called the Tally-Ho in Leesburg, Virginia.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The name of the theater is a nod to the
longtime tradition of foxhunting in the area--&quot;Tally-ho!&quot; is what you
yell when you first see the fox.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>First
some background information on the building:<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The Tally-Ho theater was built in 1923.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Since its earliest days it has had a print of a famous painting,
&quot;The Horse Fair&quot; by Rosa Bonheur, hanging in the entry of its lobby.
Originally the building had only a single theater, showed silent pictures and
was segregated--the lower level was for whites, the upper balcony for
blacks.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The place was remodeled in the
80's and split into two screening areas.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The upper level had been closed off to the public for decades and was
used partly for storage, partly as a walkway to the office and projection room.
The seats remained and often employees would watch movies up there and sneak
their friends in.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It wasn't wired for
Dolby, but hey, it was free.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I
began working at the Tally-Ho in 1995 when I was sixteen. A coworker home on
summer break from college told me, &quot;Hey, you know about the ghost,
right?&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I said no, and he proceeded
to tell me about Cliff.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Cliff had been
the projectionist at the theater about 10 years before.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Apparently he had been a weird sort, the kind
of creepy old guy that gawks at teenage girls.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>He loved the Tally-Ho, though, and spent most of his time there, not
leaving much except to buy soda and cigs from the 7-11.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>One afternoon it was showtime for the
matinee, so the manager, Mike, pushed the buzzer on the intercom.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This was usually Cliff's signal up in the
projection room to start the movie.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>After about fifteen minutes, a customer came out and asked why the movie
hadn't started.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Mike thought that maybe
something had gone wrong with the film.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The Tally-Ho has always used this old fashioned system that strings the
film from several huge rotating platters all over the room to feed it into the
projector--picture a celluloid spiderweb with the strands moving at 26 frames
per second--and the film has a tendancy to shred or burn through fairly
often.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Shredded film (where the picture
is fine but the holes are ripped so it can't feed into the projector) has to be
spliced with tape, frame by frame, and can take forever to fix.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So Mike figured Cliff was in the middle of
splicing a bad shred, and went upstairs to help out.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The projection room is situated so that you
have to turn round a sharp corner and go up a narrow little flight of stairs to
reach it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Mike turned the corner and
found Cliff sprawled dead on the stairs.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>He'd had a heart attack and simply dropped dead.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The paramedics came, but of course were too
late, and the theater staff kept everyone in their seats until the body had been
removed so that no one would get upset.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>The
summers of 1995 and 1996, all of us eventually saw and heard and felt things
that we attributed to Cliff still hanging around &quot;his&quot; theater...but
I suspect, and I think we all did, that Cliff was not the only spirit in
residence.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There was something seriously
wrong with parts of the building.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For
instance, there is a back room behind the box office where the ice machine was,
and usually we'd go in there when we arrived for our shift and change clothes
(button-down shirt, vest, bow tie, the works).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I hated changing in that room.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It
was tiny and well lit and crammed with junk, but I always felt like something
was watching me and wanted me out of there NOW.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>As in, a distinct feeling of GET OUT.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>In 1996 a psychic that walked the building cold (we didn't tell her
anything) said that the back room had a lot of negative energy, but the rest of
the lobby area and box office were clean.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Whatever was in that room, though, was NOT Cliff.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I came to know Cliff as a watchful but
harmless presence, sometimes playful in a creepy way and interested in the
daily goings-on, but never predatory the way that back room felt.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Theater #1--the &quot;old&quot; theater, with
the projection room stairs above it--was the same way.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It just didn't want you in there.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Theater #2, the &quot;new&quot; theater, felt
so safe we'd go play hide and seek in the dark between the seats.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>No one ever suggested doing that in Theater
#1, we all knew better!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>The
first bona-fide Cliff sighting that summer came when one of the other employees
went up the rickety wooden stairs to go to the upstairs storage room to do the
nightly inventory.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>After five seconds
she came rocketing out the door and gasped that she'd seen a man at the top of
the stairs, leaning over the railing staring down at her.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We all rushed up but found nothing.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Now, this girl probably would have made up a
story to freak us out, but after that incident she paid people to go do her
inventory for her.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She avoided the
upstairs like the plague...and she wasn't the type to carry a made-up story
that far.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Over the course of two years
other employees would voice unease about being upstairs.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It seemed, though that the people who got the
most freaked out were those who didn't like working there very much.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I strongly suspect that Cliff knew this and
was intentionally making them uncomfortable.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>When I was a new employee and was sent upstairs for routine duties, I
had the feeling several times that I was being sized up.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I figured if it was Cliff, then I should talk
to him.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I told him that I liked working
at the theater and that I had to be upstairs to do my job.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Which was true--I really loved working
there.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And of all the employees I was
the only one who never saw Cliff or felt panicky upstairs.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I guess he figured he could trust me!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>:)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>The
projection room stairs were definitely the weirdest place in the building.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Not the scariest, but the weirdest.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Anyone who walks up those stairs immediately
has the feeling of vertigo.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I always had
to climb up on all fours, the feeling was that strong.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Most people get lightheaded enough to stop and
have to catch themselves on the railing.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The lights from the playing movie in the room above flicker on the wall,
giving an effect similar to a mild strobe light, which may have something to do
with the vertigo.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But the feeling
subsides when you get the the projection room itself, which is an epileptic's
nightmare, the flickering light is so strong.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It's the stairs that get you...and remember, that is where Cliff had his
fatal heart attack.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>The
last Cliff sighting I remember occurred one afternoon during a matinee.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We were a small staff at that point and were
all in the lobby area goofing off, playing video games, etc.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Suddenly from overhead we heard what sounded
like a piano being dragged across the floor.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>We looked at each other and someone suggested that the manager was
moving stuff.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We heard the noise
again.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And then the manager walked out
of the restroom---which is on the same level as the lobby!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There WAS NO ONE upstairs!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The kicker came when the movie let
out...Theater #1, as it happened, home of the projection room stairs.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>One of the customers conversationally
mentioned to me that she didn't know we still allowed people to up in the
balcony. Thinking she was referring to the seats that were still up there, I
said,<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;We don't, ma'am.&quot;<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(None of the employees were up there that
day.)<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She said, and I will never forget
this: &quot;Then who was that man sitting up in the balcony watching the
movie?&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Now, we were an all-female
staff at that time...there were no men who could have been there!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>I excused myself and rushed upstairs, brave
in a way only a sixteen year old with no concept of danger can be, thinking it
had to be a homeless guy or something.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I
found....no one.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The upstairs was
completely empty.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The only man she could
possibly have seen was Cliff!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I watched their five year old son, Justin,
quite often.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>One night, I was asked to
watch Justin and his cousin Christy while their parents went out to dinner and
a movie. Christy was around 4 years old.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I
arrived at the neighbor's house and was introduced to Christy.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Justin and Christy's parents left for the
evening it was around 7pm. <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>We sat on the
floor watching TV in the den and played games.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>We were getting along great and having a good time.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>At some point, I got up off the floor and let
their poodle outside by opening the sliding glass door in the den.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It opened to the backyard.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I sat back down on the floor and continued to
play games with the kids.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>AND
about 30 min. later, Christy jumps up from where she was seated and starts
screaming and crying shouting at the top of her lungs, &quot;Ugly man, Ugly
man&quot; and points towards the kitchen, which was visible from the den.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My back was towards the kitchen and I jumped
up and snapped my head around and saw absolutely nothing.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Christy kept screaming &quot;Ugly Man. Ugly
Man&quot; and crying.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I looked over at
Justin and he sat there looking at the kitchen with his mouth open.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I
looked around the kitchen and the other parts of the house and found no
one.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I realized that I left their poodle
out side and it was standing calmly at the door wanting to be let it.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So, I let him inside and locked the door.
This dog always barked and jumped all over everyone.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I didn't think anyone came inside from these
doors.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I tried to ask Christy where the
man went after she screamed at him.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She
could not answer me and kept crying and screaming for her Mommy.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Justin began crying and I asked him what he
saw, since both he and Christy sat on the floor facing the kitchen.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He started screaming &quot;Ugly, Man, Ugly
Man,&quot; too. And he even yelled for his Mom and Jumped behind the sofa.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I
was scared out of my mind.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I had a little
girl who would not stop crying for her Mom and Justin was hiding behind the
sofa. So, I phoned my Mom.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Luckily, she
was home and came right over to their house.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>She was shocked at how hysterical the little girl was and looked around
the house.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Still we found nothing.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My Mom lectured me about not locking the
sliding glass door, but she knew that the dog was extremely hyper.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She eventually left and told me to call her
if I needed her.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Justin eventually
stopped crying and came out from behind the sofa. But Christy screamed and
cried all night long.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She sat in my lap
and clung on for dear life until her Mom finally came back.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She would never say anything except
:&quot;Ugly man&quot;.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>The
scariest thing about that whole evening was never seeing anything.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Christy was scared out of her mind.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I keep wondering about that night and wonder
if she saw an intruder or a ghost. I just don't think an intruder would be
frightened away by a four year old girl catching him in the kitchen and
screaming at him. Also, that darn poodle was so hyper and annoying that I can't
imagine someone sneaking past the dog.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>So, I'm left with the feeling we were visited by a ghost.<span

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I
attended Bishop Conaty High School in Los Angeles from 88-92.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The school was built in the 1920's and was
the first Catholic girls high school in the city.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The original building was said to be haunted
by a student who committed suicide by jumping off the gymnasium roof.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That building has since been demolished due
to earthquake damage and the school was rebuilt.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The only surviving part of the building is
the east wing.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This wing houses the
business classes and on the second floor, the computer class and typing
classroom.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I was there one late
afternoon following basketball practice.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>As my locker was located on the second floor of the east wing I along
with a couple of other students went up there to get our belongings.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We could hear the typewriters in one of the
classrooms going.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We went to check and
the doors were locked, the lights were out but the typewriters were
typing.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The next day we found, after
speaking to a teacher, that it was a regular occurrence.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Because of the original building being closed
we had to use bungalows for classes and an older building for offices and
science labs.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Next to the field were the
showers which had been turned into the chemistry lab and biology lab.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Next to that was the Athletics Dept turned
into the Main Office and Principal's office.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Our science teacher was in the biology lab and was passing by the
chemistry lab when she heard running water and girls laughing.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She believed that students had gotten into
the lab without her authorization.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Anyway upon unlocking the doors and entering the lab there was no one in
there and upon checking all of the sinks in the lab, found them all dry.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She believes they were probably old students
who were hanging out with their friends in what used to be the old locker room
and showers.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>The school also has a
history of flickering lights, chairs being moved.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In the old college counselors office there
were reports of strange smells and chairs and books being moved.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>People have also felt that they are being
watched etc.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Maybe
because it's Halloween, I'm searching on the internet for real ghost stories
and thinking of my own experiences.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I'm
glad I have a place to share them here:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>The
paranormal has always been an object of curiosity for me, but I didn't have any
experiences with it until I went to college.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I went to a small school (I won't put the name here), over 150 years old
and definitely full of stories.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In
particular, the freshman dorm had lots of them.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I will tell you three stories, one which was related to my by a group of
friends, one which myself and my roommate experienced firsthand, and one which
I experienced myself.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>The
friends' story took place in the freshman dorm, in a room that two of the girls
shared.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They and some other friends--I
think 3 other guys--were just hanging out together one night, up late.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The way those rooms were situated was that
upon entering the room, you would have a closet either to your right or left or
on both sides; either way, there would be a narrower &quot;entryway&quot; which
would then open up into the full square of the room.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As the friends were up talking, the room fell
quiet very suddenly for no apparent reason, and everyone's eyes drifted to the
full length mirror that was on the back of the door to the room.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My friend, who was sitting on her bed facing
the door, could see herself in the mirror, but could also see someone else with
her--a young woman with long dark hair, dressed in dark clothes.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Obviously not someone in the room.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>at least two of the other people in the room
also saw this.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Two people claimed to
hear a voice speaking, although they could not make out what the woman said;
others said they saw her mouth move but heard nothing.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She then was gone as suddenly as she came.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>One of the friends, who is a very devout
Christian, was very disturbed by this and started praying, and then left the
room abruptly.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Everyone else was left to
wonder what had happened.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>In
the same dorm in a different wing (at a different time of year altogether), my
roommate and I were up very very late one night talking about everything and
nothing, like we were (and are) apt to do.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>As before, we both fell silent without notice.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I felt a very real presence take over the
room in a way I had never felt before.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>We both looked, again, towards the door to our room, and while I did not
see a distinct figure in the mirror, I saw something even more strange, if that
were possible.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I saw a face....although
not a face in the sense of a picture or a real person.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It reminded me of when, as a kid I used to
play at a science museum with a table with lots of pins in it.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If you pressed your hand up from underneath,
you would see a raised impression of it on the top of the table--you know the
kind.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The effect was the same as I saw
in this face, pressing &quot;through&quot; the door--so there were facial
features, although indistinct, and a feeling of 3-D, but the door
&quot;bent&quot; around it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It lasted
only a moment, and then my roommate and I looked at each other and asked if we
had just both seen that!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Mind you, it
was 4 a.m. at the time and had I been alone, I would have blamed it on dreaming
or too much caffeine.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But since my
roommate saw it too, I know that it exists.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Afterwards the room felt empty, like the presence had left.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We never felt threatened; only as if the
spirit had popped in to see what we were doing up so late, and having satisfied
his curiosity, left again.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There are no
great death stories surrounding the dorm, so there's nothing to attribute it
to.....just a nameless spirit (well, not so nameless....after that we called
him George).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Come
to think of it, there were several times during that year that little things
came up missing, and several times that our room had an unidentified and
frankly rather putrid smell to it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I
don't know if that was related or not!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>We did have a tendency to bring home food from the cafeteria.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>The
third story happened later on, after I had moved out of that dorm and into an
upperclassman one.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Nothing too
disturbing here either; just that occasionally as I fell asleep, I would feel
the distinct feeling of a cat jumping up onto my bed, doing its paces, curling
up into a circle and laying down to sleep with me.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The only problem with this was that no pets
were allowed in the dorms and my bed was in a loft, about 8 feet in the air,
which I reached via a ladder.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Like I
said, this was not frightening at all; I love cats and missed my cat at home
very much.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was pretty
comforting.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I know that people would
sneak in animals sometimes to try to keep them as pets; I wonder if someone did
once, then either hurt it or let it die of neglect.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>The
city where this college is located is known to be something of a center for
wicca and the occult; a major river forks there and from what I've heard,
that's regarded as something of a power source for wiccans, so that might
explain the &quot;vibes&quot; in the air of the place having a life of its
own.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There were lots of other spooky
places on campus but that would just take too long to explain!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

MAY OF 1998, MY GREAT GRANDMOTHER PASSED AWAY. SO MY HUSBAND AND I WENT TO THE
HER VIEWING AND FUNERAL. A YEAR AND A HALF EARLIER MY HUSBAND'S COUSIN DIED AND
WAS BURIED IN THE SAME CEMETERY. AFTER HER FUNERAL, MY HUSBAND DECIDED HE
WANTED TO VISIT HIS COUSINS GRAVE. WE KNEW IN WHAT AREA IT WAS IN BUT HE WASNT
CERTAIN ON EXACTLY WHERE THE HEADSTONE WAS. SO WE SEARCHED AND SEARCHED AND
STILL COULDN'T FIND IT. FRUSTRATED AND TIRED WE DECIDED TO LEAVE BECAUSE IT WAS
GETTING LATE AND WE WERE BOTH GETTING KINDA HUNGRY. AS WE TURNED AROUND AND
HEADED FOR THE CAR, ALL OF THE SUDDEN I STARTED HEARING THIS MUSIC PLAYING LIKE
IT WAS COMING FROM A MUSIC BOX. I STOPPED DEAD IN MY TRACKS A TURNED AROUND AND
ABOUT 10 HEADSTONES OVER THERE WAS A LITTLE MUSIC BOX OPEN AND PLAYING MUSIC(
ODDLY AS IT SOUNDS) APPARENTLY SOMEONE HAD PUT IT THERE BECAUSE IT PROBULAY
BELONGED TO THE WOMAN WHO WAS BURIED THERE. SO MY HUSBAND AND I WALKED OVER
TOWARDS IT AND EXACTLY NEXT TO THE HEADSTONE WITH MUSIC BOX WAS MY HUSBANDS
COUSINS GRAVE. MY FACE BECAME COMPETELY FLUSHED BECAUSE I NEVER EVER
EXPIERIENCED SOMETHING SO CREEPY IN MY LIFE. TO THIS DAY IT IS STILL IN OUR

am a 45 year old retired Marine Corps Officer living near New Orleans. I have
seen many things in my 22 plus years of active military service that would
frighten the stuff out of most people. However, the most frightening thing that
ever happened to me was when I was about 7 or 8 years old growing up at 2202
8th Ave in Council Bluffs, IA. I was playing hide and seek with my brothers and
sisters. I went to hide in an upstairs closet. I was in the corner of the
closet sitting on a box of clothing. When I tried to get up to leave, something
took hold of my arms would not let me stand up.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I fought frantically for several minuets before I was able to break free
and escape. I come from a large family with a strong catholic upbringing. I am
not in the habit of making up stories. This really happened to me. To this day
I still get a rush every time I remember that experience.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I know that the house still exist because I
drove by it last year when I went home to visit my parents.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I would like to know if anyone else that has
lived there has had any experiences or if anything terrible has happened there.
I had a brother and sister that died in that house as infants, also I was told
a old woman died in that house. I would definitely like to know more about what
grabbed me in that closet that day.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Aswell,
on long branch, there are long driveways and if you walk down them at night,
you can hear footsteps right behind you. YOu can FEEL the presence of something
behind you. I live here. I know. As well, you can hear footsteps in your house
at various times. There been a time my mother and grandmother were home alone.
Well at aprx 8:15 one night they heard like heavy stomping on the roof and i
mean like a child just jumping up and down over and over. They found out a week
later at aprx 8:15 the night of the &quot;heavy stomping,&quot; was the same
night the neighbor's 2 year old son had passed away. There have been sightings
of dogs with red glowy eyes seen in various places. On the rail road tracks in
the old rock quary &quot;may mead&quot; (which is the name) there have been
sightings of reinactments of men being hit by trains. The May Mead cornfield is
said to be haunted as well, of small children of the workers who have been
killed. As far as i know, the graveyard shift at May Mead has been terminated
because no one will work it and the security will not patroll it. (This doesn't
mean explore). In houses on Long Branch, there have been light known to go on
and off, dryer doors to open and close with no one around, house front doors have
been known to be heard opening, when n hing's there or no one. Dogs and Cats
that are tame house pets suddonly start acting oddly and jump up and bark or
just, jump as if being poked or scared by a suddon pet. My mother is a perfect
whitness to this, my grandmother as well, and neighbors. There have also been
sighting of a lard almost 7ft. Black figure moving about the beginning of the
road, at the first cluster of houses. There is now an abondoned trailer at the
beginning of the road, a flood occured not too long ago and it was horrible,
tons of pets were killed. The trailer is very spooky and always seems as if
someone wonderes it, but the people living there before are good people and
moved not to far down the road.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>There is also a road called &quot;simmons
town&quot; it's a road leading off of Long branch going onto the top of a
mountain, well at a point of it on a curve, there's a small grave yard, many
years ago the tomb stones were yanked out of the ground with a truck and a
chain attatched to them, for meanness. If you cross there at any time (Which
when it was open was very common, it closed due to rock slides and now is in
progress of reopening the road), you get a creepy feeling as if someone was
with you in your backseat/passeanger seat, and some even have reported seeing
things in it. If you WALK across there at night, which i wouldn't advise (there
have been a few rape accounts) you can hear voices come from the<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>grave yard, i'm not sure of many people brave
enough to try this. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>If
there are any questions you guys have, you can e-mail me. I live on this road.
Lol, i've never been quite brave enough to explore May Mead but my mom has<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>When
I was a teenager growing up in Frankfort the Green Light specter was a pretty
famous haunt. I have spent many a spooky evening looking for the Green Light,
but have only seen it one time. That particular night I was with a group of
probably 10 friends, and we had gathered on the railraod tracks not far from
the trestle, when we ALL spotted the Green Light moving along the tracks in our
direction.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I
had a sleepover and we stayed up until about two in the morning. My friend
{Tori} woke up and she saw a face of a little boy about the age of eight or so.
She woke me up and then I saw him and we ran down stairs as fast as we could.
we then fell asleep on the couch in the living room. I woke up later at about
six in the morning and I saw the little boy standing right next to his mom {on
the left} and his dad {on the right } then tori woke up and she looked at them
and her mouth just dropped and then they vanished right in front of our
eyes.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The next night I fell asleep with
the television on and I woke up right when it was being turned off<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>and I saw the mom in her white dress right by
the TV so I assumed it was her. Every time I go to sleep I always see the mom
or the little boy. I amused to seeing them now so I am not that afraid of them
anymore. I talked to tori and she said that she's used to it because she has
stayed over at least 3 times after we saw them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

is a house directly across from the<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Elementary School that I lived in when I was 14 or 15 years old. It was
rumored to be an old house of ill repute and that one of the johns were killed
in that house. I had heard stories of mysterious happenings from my mom, dad,
and sister that it was haunted. I really didn't believe it until late one night
I lay awake on the couch in the livingroom and the porch door of the house had
opened, thinking it was just my sister, didn't pay too much attention until the
back door opened and then closed with noone there.The footsteps went into the
kitchen and as they went by the stove the flames suddenly rose up and down
again. Then came the sound of the rear bathroom door opening with the sounds of
the glass beaded curtain hitting the window on the bathroom door and shut. I
was so frozen I couldn't move or even make a sound. As I lay there trying to
process what I had seen or not seen and what I heard, this all happened again
as the bathroom door with glass beaded curtain opened and closed, the stove did
it's alarming flame dance, the back door opened and closed and then the porch
door as well. Only a few short seconds after the porch door closed, my sister
came from her room just off the back porch and said &quot;do you believe us
now?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Before
buying this house my exhusband told my son that a teenage boy hung himself here
in the 1980s. I thought he was being funny and trying to scare my son so I
thought nothing else of it. Then after we moved in I started hearing knocking
noises that sounded as if they were coming from the front of the house but when
I would walk toward the sound it would stop.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>My son, whose bedroom is upstairs, told me he was hearing knocking
noises too but they seemed to come from the staircase.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then, about 6 months after we moved in, I
woke up during the night hearing someone walking through the dining room and
into the living room which is right beside my bedroom. I had a roomate at the
time and called out to her, assuming it was her, but suddenly the footsteps
stopped and did not resume for several minutes. I started to doze back off when
I heard the footsteps in the living room again. This time I was terrified and
started thinking maybe there was an intruder in the house. I sat up and called
out my<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>roomates name again but again the
sound stopped and I got no response. Suddenly I heard the back door and then
the dog started barking. I got up and the dog was standing at the back door
barking. The wood door was slightly ajar and the storm door was closed. I went
to my roomate who said she had not been downstairs and had not heard anything.
We called police but they found no footprints in the muddy soil out back nor
did they find any on the back porch. Nothing was missing. Only later did we
realize - the dog did not bark until the door closed. She ALWAYS barks when
someone comes near the house and barks at people when they come in. We started
to think about it being a ghost. A few weeks later we came in late one night
and I sent my son upstairs to get a shower. As he was getting out he saw a dark
shadow shaped like a man go past the bathroom. After waiting a minute, frozen
in fear, he came running downstairs to me. We called a friend, an off duty
police officer to check out the house as we sat on the porch. He found nothing.
We were becoming convinced that we had a ghost so I called my ex about his
story. He said it was true, he knew the guy who hung himself here. His bedroom
was the one I was using at the front of the house. The knocking had been
ongoing and after the two scary incidents we called a Catholic friend. Her
priest agreed to come bless the house and sprinkle holy water throughout it. He
did this and prayed over it and the occurences stopped for about a year. Then
out of the blue one day I heard the back door latch turning. Expecting my
sister, I turned around, wondering why she came to the back door. Noone was
there and I watched as the handle turned and the storm door opened then
suddenly slammed shut. My dog had been lying against it outside. When it opened
she jumped up and just stared it. My sister arrived a few minutes later - at
the front door.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Since then the wooden
door has opened on its own several times. One night I had just closed and
walked away when I heard it open, turned around and saw it ajar. I closed it
again and went to bed. We decided that our ghost may be a prankster.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Now our ghost has a new trick. For almost a
year now he has been turning on the water in the bathtub and then turning it
back off. One night my mom and I were talking just outside the bathroom when
she said she was going to get a shower. Suddenly the water rushed on and turned
back off just as quickly. It was 30 minutes before she finally would go in
there and shower. It has happened several times when we just hear it, twice
while I was sitting in the bathtub.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
only time we have ever felt like the ghost was doing more than just playing
with us was right after my new fiance moved in with me.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He was taking a shower one night when
suddenly the light turned off and the water got very hot. He jumped away from
the hot water and then went to try to reach the faucet with getting into the
stream of hot water when the light turned back on and the water went back to
normal. He got out of the shower very shaken up and told me what happened. I
had never told him about our ghost for fear it would spook him and keep him
from moving in. When I told him, he was convinced that the ghost did not want
him here. Lucky for me he stayed anyway and has not had another run in with the
ghost. And just one more note - an afterthought - when we moved her my dog was
6 years old and very well behaved. She began acting erratic, barking at the
door a lot even when noone was there, wanting to sleep with me, which she had
never been allowed to do, and not eating well. She has calmed down now,
although she still sometimes will jump up and look to the door, barking, only
for me to look and see that noone is there. We still hear knocking noises, too,
and one night sounds like someone walking upstairs, a heavy person from the
sound of it, even though my fiance and I were the only ones here. He went up to
look but the sounds stopped and he found nothing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Well..My
name is Rachel Kennedy, and I have 3 &quot;ghost&quot; stories, starting to
when I was 5 years old.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>1)
I was in bed at the age of 5, we lived in a one story house and my bedroom was
at the back of the house. I was always a &quot;sensitive&quot; child, and on
this particular night, I awoke to the chills and the hair on the back of my
neck standing up. I looked around, and in my bedroom window was a ghostly
menacing looking face, kind of similar to a clown/pirate (I was young and
FREAKED OUT)...he was laughing at me waving his hands, and I just froze. I
watched for about 10 seconds, then closed my eyes in the hope this aparition
would go away. It did and I sat stunned for about 5 more minutes before I ran
to my mother's room freaking out. That was my first experience.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>2)
When I was 7 or 8, we (my brother, mother and I) were in New Jersey staying at
an aunt's house, she had a screened back porch and we were on cots sleeping.
Their house backed on to a wooded area, and it was a sultry summer night.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I
awoke, again, to chills and the hair standing up on the back of my neck. I
looked around..everyone was sound asleep. I looked towards the woods, and about
50 yards away I saw a white, &quot;fuzzy&quot; figure floating toward me. I
watched it come closer, and I was frozen in fear. I swear my heart stopped
beating. It got to within 15 yards of us, and stopped. I couldn'tmove out of
fear. It hovered just above the ground for about 5 seconds, and then turned and
headed back in the direction of the woods. I pulled the covers tight over my
head, and layed with my eyes wide open for the rest of the night.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>3)
This all happened when my mother passed away in June of 2003. I lived with my
mother until she died. It was a sudden,unexpected death. I came home at 3am to
find my Mother dead of a massive heart attack, face down on her bed. that is a
vision I still live with everyday.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>For
the days following her death, I would go back to the house (I wouldn't sleep
there at night) daily and make phone calls, check emails..etc.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I
would be on the computer, the house was quiet, I would feel drafts (no windows
were open), I would walk from one room into another and feel very cold spots,
especially around the spots my Mom liked to sit, work or eat.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I
would talk to her, and I never felt any fear, I felt comfort from her presence.
Well, that all changed 2 days after the funeral.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>My
father, being from England, and I decided to stay a couple nights at Mom's
place to save him money on hotels. We were up late (11:45pm), I was chekcing
emails (my Mom HATED me being on the computer late), and all of a sudden, the
brand new computer shut down completely. Power and all. I laughed and told Dad
that Mom was mad I was on the computer so late. So we prepared to go to bed.
Dad was going to sleep on my sofa bed, and I was going to sleep on Mom's bed. I
went in her room to get my Dad another blanket, and as I walked back around the
foot of her bed, I stopped in the spot she had the heart attack. All of a
sudden, the little light she had on the wall next to the bed shook, and I was
pushed back as she went THROUGH me. I was shocked. It felt just like a mild
electric shock (like a tingling feeling) from the inside, with heat also from
the inside. I could feel her go in the front, all teh way through me and out
the back. Behind me was her dresser.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I
was so freaked out I couldn't move. My Dad had to calm me down (all I could say
was &quot;holy sh%&amp;&quot;) then, I heard her. I told my Dad to be quiet and
listen. I could hear her rolling over in her bed, I should know what it sounds
like, I slept on the other side of that wall for 9 months. That was enough for
me, she was pissed, and we were leaving. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I
went back to pick my things up from the basement a few days later, and my God
mother (she owned the building and lives there) and I were in the basement below
my Mom's apartment, when we hear this almighty banging upstairs. I knew it was
Mom, but my Godmother decided to go check it out. Nothing. I know it was Mom,
and so does she. There was NO explanation for the noise in my Mom's locked
apartment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>My
nephew came downstairs at my Brother's house also 2 days after the funeral,
saying &quot;where's gramma Pat..I hear her, where is she?&quot;. No
explanation needed there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>My
aunt said my Mom paid her a visit just after her death to let her know she is
ok and not to worry.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I
have been a nervous person ever since, and I know my Mom is still around, but
it comforts me to know she's looking after me, even in death. But I can do
without the physical experiences!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

story that I've recently remembered.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My

few days ago, and she told me this story, which I then remembered that she had
told me before, and had just forgotten about it.<span

it, I guess I owe my life to the fact that this happened.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>This
story takes place when I was about three and a half, although I do not remember
the circumstances myself.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>At that time
my mother had married my first step-father, and was pregnant with my
sister.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My step-father had family in New
York, which is where he was from, so they decided to go to New York to see his
family. (We were from California)<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>At
that time he had a 1973 Toyota corolla, which would at that time have been
about a year and<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>half old.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We drove through a lot of states, as they
decided to make a big sightseeing trip out of this.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>These events happened as we were driving
through Colorado.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>One
night, I gathered from her story, it was quite late, and they had been driving
for some time, and, as they were well out in the middle of nowhere, they
decided to pull over on the side of the road and sleep for a few hours.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They were in the mountains, and on an
incline.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Mom told me that they had been
there about ten minutes when she had the most horrible feeling that something
was terribly wrong, so she woke my step-father, Carlos, and told him that she
wanted to move on, that something was wrong and she didn't feel safe.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He agreed to go ahead on, so he went to start
the car, but it just wouldn't start. This was thee first time that the car had
had problems, it was still pretty new, and had always functioned just
fine.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He kept trying to start the car,
and mom was starting to cry by the, almost overwhelmed by fear.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>All of a sudden, my mom said that as she
looked out past Carlos, out the drivers side window, she saw a man
just.........appear.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She said it was
like he just stepped out from behind a curtain.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>He knocked on the window, and asked my step-father if he could help in
any way.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He was wearing overalls witha
long sleeved shirt, and an old style cap.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>My step-father told him that the car wouldnt start, and the man walked
to the front of the hood, and mom says that he just touched the car.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The hood wasnt even up.......and then told
them to try again.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The car started right
up.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Mom looked out the window and she
said the man just vanished.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Well they
went on ahead for about ten minutes or so and finally came to a level area with
a good wide shoulder, that looked to be in between two huge outcroppings of
rock.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She didnt feel anything wrong
anymore, so they pulled over and prepared to go back to sleep.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When my step-father went to put on the hand
brake, however, they found that it wasnt working any longer.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But since the car was on level ground, and
there was no danger of rolling, they decided to sleep ill morning and then go
back to the last town they had passed through which was about forty miles back
the way they had come.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>The
next morning, as they went back to that twon, they passed the place where they
had been parked the night before, and thats when Mom got a nasty shock.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They had been parked not five feet from the
edge of a cliff with a huge drop of several hundred feet.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If the hand brake had gone BEFORE they had
gotten out of there, we would all have gone over that cliff.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Furthermore, the area was completely
deserted, with no homes or people for miles.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>When they got back to that town, and were having the brake fixed, they
mentioned what had happened, and the man told them that no one lived out there
and that that was also a bad area with a lot of wrecks.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Mom told me that when that man had come up to
the car, there had been no traffic, in fact, there hadnt been any in the whole
time they had been in that spot.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If
there was no traffic and no homes out there, where did that man come
from????<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Was he a ghost, maybe someone
else who had died on that stretch, or something else???<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Whatever or whoever he was, I have to say we
all owe our lives to him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>This
is not really a scary story but it is very similar to your a few I have read
here. One particular, Mike's &quot;little creatures&quot; located on the first
page of &quot;real stories...&quot; section. I'll admit I'm a hopeful skeptic
in ghosts and the paranormal and personally I have only had two instances that
could remotely be considered an encounter or experience, whatever you want to
call it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Anyway, I happened upon this
sight looking for a ghost story website.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It's close to Halloween and I wanted to read some ghost stories, I found
this site and Mike's story. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I
have told only three people about this and I think about it on occasion, or
better said I remember it on occasion.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I
find myself revisiting the night I saw the same little man as described in
Mike's story.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It is so vivid after all
these years and reading this story made it even more so and brought it back to
life for me.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>To
keep it short, one night I was awakened at 1:23 or 2:13 or 2:14AM I know it was
one of these times, I just have forgotten which time it was for sure.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I looked at the clock as soon as my eyes
opened because the clock was in the same line of sight as the doorway, which
was my focal point.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I woke up to watch
three little men, turn form the hallway and walk in to my room, three little
2-3 foot men fitting the same description as in Mike's story.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I am not sure about the bushy beard though,
they were white though, that is for sure. Their entire silhouette, all three
were white, the same color white from head to toe, detailed white figures. I
could see arms and legs covered by what seemed to be clothes, I could not see
their faces, just white heads. The three of them marched in one after the other
into my room and into my closet, I used to leave the closet door open back
then.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I was perplexed and scared, I
didn't know to scream, run out or what so I just laid there wide eyed watching
the closet door and the bedroom door for the rest of the night or as long as I
could.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I did fall a sleep later that
night.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I
woke up with the image burnt in my mind, obviously, still today see the
vividness of the three little men and the entire event as if it just
happened.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I didn't tell anybody about it
that next day chalking it up to imagined situation, dream state, whatever.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Here is where it gets strange to me, the<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>very next night at the exact same time I woke
up to see the three little men leaving the closet (which was closed this time)
one after the other out of my room back down the hallway back the same
direction in which they came the night before! I still try to think I imagined
the entire thing, but it was just too real.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I have never had any more viewings of them but these two separate events
happening on consecutive nights at the exact same time has always been and I
guess always will be etched in my memory.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>First
off, thank you for your site, for the haunted places index, and for publishing
peoples personal stories regarding the supernatural.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>To
say &quot;it all started when&quot; would give a wrong impression, due to the
isolation of most of the events... I was born in Memphis, TN but at the age of
3 we moved to Surgoinsville, on the far northeastern corner of the state. I was
a happy but quiet little kid, who minded my own business and drew fire engines
when I wasnt playing in the woods. Around the age of 5, I had a very vivid
dream several times over that year... the dream took place in a land I knew
nothing of, nor did I have a name for it. My mind was filled with images of
people being burnt, starved, and most of all impaled. I saw distinct shots of a
castle in the skyline and vivid pictures of a mans face. At my age, I thought
nothing of this, assuming Im just weird but thats okay. Many years later
however, we got cable television, and at the age of 12 I saw those images once
more... only they were no longer in my dreams, but on the Discovery Channel, a
special about Prince Vladimir Teppes, or Vlad Dracul and his forest of the
impaled he made with his foes. This experience became a bit more alarming last
summer while I was on vacation with my mother, and was reading the Handbook of
Christian Apologetics by Peter Kreeft... regarding reincarnation, he spoke of
how it is more likely that &quot;flashbacks&quot; and dreams of a past life
suggest more of a memory bank kept within the species DNA, a shared
consciousness in someways, or they were planted there by a spirit, be it good
or evil... and the more I think about this, the more it concerns me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I
am unclear as to if this is related or not, but from second to third grade... I
had suicidal urges, very strong ones. I wasnt depressed, I did not have a
distaste for life, but I felt that I was simply a bit of a burden on my parents
and family, simply that at times it was hard to make ends meet, and I added to
the grocery bill. Several times I would eye the large knives my father has,
being a chef... or loiter in my parents bedroom while they were at work,
looking out the screendoor which at one point led onto the deck, but now was
just a story drop onto the concrete supports and metal stakes the deck had been
built upon. I often thought of death, of afterlife... it didnt necessarily
greatly appeal to me, other than the intrinsic attraction of the unknown, but
it didnt leave my mind for long at all either. However I also did not feel compelled
to commit suicide (I guess you could say Im bad with commitment) and was swayed
by simple things, such as one of my siblings calling my name because they
needed me for something, the phone ringing, the screen door being stubborn in
opening, and ultimately, not wanting to upset my parents with my death, despite
all the savings on the grocery bill it could bring about. The impulses went
away from the most part, though sometimes while riding on the highway, I would
get the urge to open the door and just hurl myself out... I still experience
that from time to time today.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>At
the age of 9 I had a vivid dream of Heaven and of Hell, and I cant really
properly describe it... only that my curiousity of Hell and the danger it
represented to me, was what identified it as such.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I
should probably mention that my sister has a history of dreams that can
illuminate future tragedies, and seems sensitive to the supernatural. In our
first home in Surgoinsville, her room was on the bottom floor, and partially
subterranean. The head of her bed was flat against the wall, and above it was a
small window... looking out this window you could see clear across the
backyard, from an ant's point of view, mostly beneath the soil. However one
night she woke up suddenly in her sleep and gasped, to see a hand that was open
above her face suddenly tense up into a claw like form, and quickly pull back
into the wall below her window. I myself have never slept in that room, but I
never liked being in certain parts of the basement, including that room.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>When
I was 11 we moved into a new home, maybe 500 yards from the New Providence
Church's cemetary, home of the Old White Oak as reported on your haunted places
index. Not much happened regarding the supernatural for many years, until my
sophomore year of high school that I began spending the night many times at a
friends house in Churchill (also in the index for 'Fields') who lived across
the street from a graveyard. Often late at night we would go hang out in the
graveyard, not to be 'spooky' but simply for the fact that the night air felt
good, and we werent trespassing on anyones lawn there. However we often had a
sense of being watched... and so in response to feeling like the victims of a
voyeur, we would start going for walks. The walks became just a given part of a
Friday night, but it had its own visitors to it, in the forms of silhouettes
that sprinted rapidly from place to place, and could come to a full stop,
defying physics, on a dime. More upfront was that of a solid black foggy mass,
that would move, and seemed to pursue us (over the course of several blocks),
and often street lights would go out where it moved through... During all of
these experiences I stressed that we remain steadfast... to keep a consistent
pace, but more importantly to not turn around if it felt close, to stop, or to
run. On one of the most vivid nights, we returned to his house, after a brisk
walk with fear clinging onto our collars trailing behind us, to see his cat
sitting outside... a very friendly cat which has always been nice to me and
would rub up against my legs, not minding my company at all. Too night was not
done with being an exception, as the cat hissed at us violently, and ran off
behind the house, not showing up till late the next morning.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Within
his house we also had a brief experience, sitting in his computer room (ogling
over the latest first person shooter no doubt) all present company accounted
for, when I felt a cold, and turned around to see one of the silhouettes race
past the door frame, and the cat who was under the computer desk scrambled out
of the room and took off in the opposite direction. Though interestingly
enough, nothing else happened that night.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>However
all of this pales in comparison to what happened one night at my home during
our junior year... For the sake of setting, our house is a new one, we moved
into it just before its construction was completed. It faces the south towards
a small airport, and with large windows and a vaulted ceiling in the living
room, the panning lights from the airport cut easily into our home, and even
with the door closed, you can still see the lights come in under the door
itself.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>My
same friend was spending the night with me, and due to my parents being a
little more restricted about how we spent our time at night, we decided to goto
bed early... retreating to my room, myself to my bed and he to a sleeping bag
on the floor, we began talking. And talking, and talking, and talking. Until we
landed on the subject of angels and demons... and the possibility of them being
&quot;the same biological species&quot;... I remember nothing of what we
concluded in the conversation, only the subject matter, which is bizarre due to
my very good memory. However one of us suddenly noticed that... we couldnt
move. We werent the least bit tired, so it couldnt have been paralysis brought
on by sleep... All we could do was speak, move our eyes, and turn our heads
some, but our bodies seemed rigid. At this point we noticed the room seemed
brighter... not that there was more light to it, but that the darkness
concealed less... Like someone had duplicated a layer in photoshop and set one
to 'Screen'... doubling the values so what was visible, was more so. We noticed
that the room seemed to have many of the silhouettes now, lining the wall, but
they were standing still (and no geometry in the room could account for the
possibility of shadows), however there was a specific one in the northwest
corner... which seemed taller than the room itself, a weird sort of depth
distortion. We could speak to one another, and heard no sound outside of our
own voices, not even house ambience, but we agreed that there seemed to a
rather aggressive message present of &quot;This is above you and does not
concern you, speak no more of it&quot;. I noticed I could no longer see the
light coming in from under the door... and the complete silence of the house
(not even central air could be heard) was quite alarming to me. However this
last bit is what grabbed me the most... on my wall is a crucifix... it is a
deep wooden color and Jesus is silver... our home had been blessed when we
moved in by a Catholic priest. The crucifix seemed to be a light source unto
itself... and Jesus on the cross was not only animated... but writhing in
agony. Somewhere around this point consciousness ceased, and we were awoken the
next morning to my friend being called into work early. Everything felt so
surreal... I have tried to speak with him about it sense, but he gets upset and
rejects the topic... the times I have persisted he started shouting at me to
&quot;shut up&quot; about it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>During
this same time period I had had many sightings of the silhouettes in my own
home... running from my room to that of my little brothers, and across the
living room to my parents room. I could also see down the kitchen into the den,
where they would be &quot;active&quot; but fadeaway when near the kitchen
itself. Once, just after a shower one evening, I had begun to brush my teeth
and looked up into the mirror, to not see the back wall of the bathroom, but in
fact... just thousands of the silhouettes, extending so far back... I whirled
around to look it head on, and saw just my bathroom wall, though the drywall
had a &quot;quiver&quot; to it, like it had snapped back into place by
something, fast enough that it caused the solid to ripple like a liquid... very
briefly... Around this same time my younger brother had an imaginary friend,
which I wont go into, but I suspect just how much of the friend was contained
to the boundaries of his imagination, judging by the conversations I overheard him
having alone in his room, and general behavior at the time. Also during this
period, I uld often stay up late using the PC... usually online on mIRC or ICQ
talking to friends of mine in gaming communities. My father had gone to bed
around 11:45, and I had locked the door, both the knob lock and the bolt lock
and checked it... I then went back up to the pc and was chatting away, when
around 20 minutes later I heard a voice just behind me, to my right (and to my
right was outside, not another room of the house) as if someone behind me had
leaned in to speak into my right ear, and said in a whisper with a tone that
could best be described as &quot;cartoony&quot;, &quot;Lock the door.&quot; It
had a simple stated emergency that riled me up, and I immediately turned
around... everyone else was asleep... I headed back down to the den to find the
door completely unlocked, as if I had never done it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>A
year after this, my sister had moved back in with us, and taken over my
bedroom, needing it due to being pregnant at the time, and so I had been moved
into the den and back onto my old twin sized bed. Living down there was
different, and the summer was filled with anxiety due to the fact that I would
soon depart for college. However there was one consistent feature... the old
man who would sit on our couch. Regularly when I used the bathroom late at
night and came out of it, I could see the couch in our living room, and there
was an old man sitting on the far left cushion... he seemed to evaporate
whenever approached, but if not, his gaze would follow me across the dining
room until I was out of sight... it creeped me out, but was also so passive I
thought little of it. I mentioned this offhand to my sister at one point, who
confirmed she had in fact seen him many nights.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>However
one of the scariest occurences was during my last week at my parents house...
Waking up in the middle of the night to a weight on my chest. Not just a
weight... a pressing down, a pushing and a holding... with hot breath on my
neck... yet I could see nothing on me... it hurt terribly but all I could do
was pray for it to end, and quickly fell back to sleep despite the pain.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>During
this time though, I had an experience with the supernatural that was in fact,
not scary at all, or even creepy. My junior year of high school I went on a
youth retreat with some local Catholic churches. I was miserable, I despised it
and did not enjoy the company of anyone present. I was disillusioned and was
determined to not enjoy anything at all... the night was wrapping up and we
were in our small groups... ours had been led blindfolded into the chapel and
presented just past the altar before the crucifix... everyone had bowed their
heads in prayer... but I hadnt. I sat there, kneeling, but eyes open wide and
looking up at Jesus on the cross... and he sighed. I blinked, looked to the
left and right.... and back to the left, as the stone statue of the Virgin Mary
indicated to me to look back up... and I saw Jesus smile at me, nodding his
head slightly, and I was filled with the sensation of &quot;Do not let them
affect you, bring you down or affect your relationship&quot;. I came out of
that weekend feeling better then I ever had...<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>During
my first 2 years of college, I had no experiences really, living in the dorms
and in student housing just off campus... I am still at present attending East
Tennessee State University, which has 4 entries on your index (a few of which,
some friends can confirm) and am now living off campus with my bible study
leader. However over the summer I had what can only be an attempt at
possession, and the scariest moment of my life, which left me for 45 minutes
incapable of opening my mouth and emitting anymore then a sob... collapsing and
punching at the walls. It is at the moment... too personal for me to go into,
only that I would rather relive every negative moment of my life again, a
hundred times over, then experience another second of the Hell I was shown by
that evil. And it happened again last week, but with subterfuge... appearing to
me in the form of my girlfriend... These experiences are too personal for me to
go into detail about, but they have kept me wary of what I open myself to.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Thank
you for your time, I hope my experiences, though limited in their detail, were
at least of interest to you.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>This
story is about 12 years old. When my wife was pregnant with my first child - my
son. We went to visit my sister at her new home - a rental house in Greensboro
NC. The moment I got out my car, I told my wife that the place is haunted. I
noticed that there was a woman looking out of the second floor window. I am
fairly clairvoyant and I knew that the woman was from the early part of this
century and radiated a light blue glow. She was sad but for what reason, I am
not sure. I did not mention the ghost to my sister or her family but did
mention it to my mother days later. A few months later at the reception of my
son's baptism, my sister dragged me into my bedroom. She was crying and very
angry at me. She asked why I did not tell her about the ghost. It seems that my
sister, out of fear, was sleeping at my parents home the week prior to the
baptism. My sister reported that she and her family (husband and two sons)
frequently heard someone walk up and down the steps and move furniture around
downstairs. The night before my sister went to sleep at my parents' home (the
reason why she did so) the ghost actually made its presence known physically.
My sister and her husband were lying in bed. They heard the footsteps outside
their door. They then saw the bedroom door open and few few seconds later it
closed itself again. I told my sister what I felt (I visited my sister's home

home.). I believe that there were two entities. There was one who lived
upstairs - the woman and then another ghost who lived in the basement.<span

and I think a man. You never saw him but felt tension and uncomfortability.
Eventually my sister moved back in with her family and the footsteps seemed to
calm down after some time. Several months later during the spring,<span

sister's home. All of a sudden, a<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>loud
crash was heard in the house. When they investigated, they found the basement
door open and the windows of the kitchen door broken outwards into the yard.
The kitchen door was still locked and their was no one else in the house. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>My
mother worked for a small mortgage company in Colorado and it was located in a
small building. There were about six people that worked for this company and
after several months of working there; which was about how old this building
was right around &quot;closing time&quot; around five o'clock everyone would
hear a small dog whimpering somewhere in the kitchen area. This confused
everyone at first and they all searched the building high and low; in cabinets
and closets and even under the building where there was a crawl space. They
kept hearing this dog whimpering, before finally leaving they made sure that
there was no possible way for any animal to find its way in the crawl space or in
the office itself. No one could figure out where this sound was coming from.
Needless to say, everyone was a bit puzzled and being the humanitarian my
mother is she put a bowl of water out and a few sraps of food on the kitchen
floor and then she left as she was the last to leave that night. Later that
evening my mother was still very concerned about this dog sound so she went
back to the office and upon reaching the kitchen she noticed that the food was
gone and the water she left was half empty. On the kitchen floor was a few
small dog prints. Every day at some time or another since then someone in the
office would be doing something when they would feel this small dog rub up
against them on the leg like a cat would and hear a small whimper. That's the clue
to check the water and food dish and sure enough its empty.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>loud
bird cries. One day while over there, I asked my cousin's friend what <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>that
sounds where coming from. He said that they were from these really huge <o:p></o:p></span></p>

had a little terrier dog that is a nervous little thing (now I know <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>My
name is Tracey, and I am 14 years old. Ever since I could remember I have been
a firm believer in ghosts, and abnormal things. I have only a few specific
experiences to share with you, but I constantly see things out of the corner of
my eye, doors shut all by themselves, I hear strange noises, and I always feel
like I'm being watched. Once my friend, Kailtin, came over to our house for a
sleep over, and we were laying in bed in the dark scaring ourselves, and
telling ghost stories. During her tale I stopped her abruptly, and said 'shhh'
and we stopped, and all of a sudden all of the games on the top shelf of my
closet came crashing down. We screamed, and ran into my mom's room - we refused
to go back in my room. Another time was when my brother and I were home alone -
my parents were out, and we were hungry. We decided to &quot;steal&quot; some
of the oreo's my mom had in the cupboard, so we were eating them when the
garage door opened. (You can tell when our garage door opens - it's a distinct
sound, plus my parents ALWAYS shut the garage door when they leave). We figured
my parents were just home, so we hurried and put the oreo's away. We turned on
the t.v, sat down, and act like we were good little angels watching television
the whole time. About 15 minutes later they still hadn't come in, so we decided
to go downstairs and see what was taking them so long, and when we got down
their our hearts sunk - the garage door was totally shut, and the power (we have
an electric garage door, and the power has to be on in order to even open it)
was off, and there were no cars in he garage. My brother and I quickly ran up
the stairs, and locked ourselves in the computer room - we were shaken and so
frightened. A little while later my parents got home, and immediately we asked
them if they had come home earlier - they said no, and we told them what
happened. They told us it was just our imaginations. A few weeks later Jon (my
brother) and I were downstairs playing a video game when we heard someone
walking around in the garage, and we figured it was just my dad, so no big
deal. We went outside to talk to him, and see what he was doing, but when we
got out there it was dark, and no one was out there - it turned out my dad was
upstairs, and my mom was at work - we were petrified. My parents just told us
not to worry, that no one was in the house, and that no one could get us - so
we listened to them, but I was still shaken.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Recently
I've been hearing things, like my name being called in the middle of the night,
and I've been seeing things dart out of the corner of my eye - my parents tell
me that it's nonsense, and they don't believe me. Also, ever since I was little
I see the spirit of a little girl dressed in old dutch-looking clothing, and
she stands right in front of my perticular window. I have only seen her a few
times, but not recently - I call her &quot;Engle&quot; which means
&quot;Angel&quot; in Dutch. I told my friends about this, but they just make
fun of it, and won't take me seriously either - it's really starting to bug me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Although
sometimes I get very scared (especially when I'm home alone) I try to tell
myself that it's just my imagination, but it's hard to believe that because I
know that there are things in my house - I have seen them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>couldn't
remember exactly what had happend at my flat... I think that <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>sounded
odd, since he had just been there. And had some sort of <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>encounter
with this mystery dog.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>For
those who think that he was just making up excuses for charging more <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>for
coming twice, I can tell that he wasn't getting anything more that <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>was
agreed anyway. He came and finished photographing the wall. I <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>haven't
heard of him ever since. I assume that he wasn't interrupted any <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>more
by a dog, dead or alive. Apparently the wall was ok, too.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>And
what am I supposed to think about this? I am a sworn sceptic, but <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>for
this incident I have no good explanation. I kind of hoped afterwards <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>that
there actually would be a ghost of Alma. Despite of having a new <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>puppy
I missed her so much that it hurt. Alas, I haven't seen a glimpse <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>of
a a little ghost frenchie. I am still in doubt as to what comes to <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>the
paranormal nature of this incident. In fact, very much so! But isn't <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>it
a heartwarming thought that my beloved Alma would still be watching <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>When
I was little (about 12) my mom was telling my brother ghost stories.I had just
over-heard one about when Jackie (my aunt) was about 16. She was out driving
around the city and had asked her dad if she could stay out a little later,he
said &quot;no&quot; she begged him and after a while they got into a fight. She
stormed off to her room and locked the door,windows any everything else. She
went to bed a litlle early that night. When she woke up in the morning her
chair was tipped over and there were ciggarette buts in her trash can. She knew
her mom nor dad smoked that kind of ciggarettes and how did they get her door
unlocked?then she smelt eggs and had heard the sound of siseling bacon. She
went into the kitchen and saw nothing. then she went into her mom and dads room
and they were sound asleep. Later that day she had asked them about it and
didnt know anything. To this day we still dont know what it was or how it did
what it did...but they are all still alittle freaked out about it. Also when my
mom was about 13 she would wake up in the middle of the night and see a male
figure dressed in all black always holding a knife or a gun and just befor it
would get to her it would disapear her mother had seen it once also.....wierd
things have been in my family for soo long but i have yet to see anything....<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I
just looked at your website, intending a little Halloween fun, but got drawn
into it when I scrolled through some of the hauntings in the Iowa category, in
particular Calvary Cemetery.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I lived in
Sioux City from Nov. 1969 through July 1977, and lived within walking/cycling
distance of Calvary.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Legends abounded,
and my friends and I had our share of scary experiences there, as well as at
Camp Joy, the Girl Scout Camp in Stone State Park.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>However,
I'm writing to tell you about the haunted house my family and I lived in during
the aforementioned time period.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
house was located at 2000 W. 18th Street on the City's west side, near West
High School, at the corner of John St. and W. 18th. It was a one and a half
story house.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My family--parents, three
older sisters, myself, and a younger brother, as well as an assortment of cats
and dogs--all had paranormal experiences in that house up till the day we moved
out.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I was only 5 when we moved there,
and cannot recall exactly how old I was when I first realized the place was
haunted.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I do know that at least from
age 6 onward I was always afraid to be in the basement alone.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My siblings shared that fear.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We always felt we were being watched.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There were occasional cold spots. There was a
mirror behind the bar that always seemed to have SOMETHING in it looking out at
one.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Once a flag, propped in a corner
since my brother's last Cub Scout meeting, fell over for no reason as I was
leaving the room, having felt a profound sense of terror and being watched as I
entered the room to retrieve the game I was sent to fetch.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It should be noted that I had tried to make
my dog go to the basement with me and he dug in his feet, pulled out of his
collar, and ran off.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>On
many occasions my brother and I both saw our dog and cats literally freak out
for no reason in the basement, sometimes after staring intently at an interior
wall or out into the room.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My brother
and I would also sense our usual fright before the animals reacted; the cats
would puff up, arch their backs, hiss at whatever they sensed, then flee; the
dog would raise his hackles, growl at whatever it was, then cry out and
flee.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Many years later my dad told me
how difficult it always was to put the pets in the basement at night, where
they slept.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Dad
had a workshop in the back half of the laundry room, and would usually go down
there later at night after family time.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>He routinely saw an apparition he dubbed the &quot;Grey Lady&quot;
watching him from the area of the water heater and furnace--an area that
terrified my siblings and me.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He said
the &quot;Grey Lady&quot; never did anything but watch him, and he became used
to her presence.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>My mom confessed to my
aunt and grandma that she always felt &quot;watched&quot; while she was doing
laundry, and did not like to be down there alone.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Years later, she recanted so as not to scare
her grandchildren; however, that same aunt and grandma occasionally stayed with
us and they too had similar experiences as the rest of the family in the
house.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My oldest sister frequently had a
&quot;sense&quot; out of the corner of her eye that someone was hanged in the
laundry room.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>The
first floor--we all lost count over the years how many times SOMETHING rocked
in Dad's recliner rocker at night after we were all abed.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My brother, whose bedroom was on the first
floor until spring of 1976, was beset with nightmares throughout his tenure in
that room.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>The
top floor of the house was not a full story, as it was under the eaves.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was bisected by the staircase, which I was
often frightened to ascend, especially at night.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>At the top was a very large landing, with a
door under the eaves leading to a storeroom we called the
&quot;attic&quot;.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That door was always
opening for no reason, and no one felt comfortable in that room.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Cold air often came out of the attic.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>At night, my sisters and I, and later my
brother, would frequently hear footsteps on the hardwood floor out on the
landing and in the two bedrooms upstairs.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>In both bedrooms, my siblings and I, on more occasions that I can count
over the years, would see a whitish-green to green mist in the mirrors, and
sometimes orbs of that color.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We lived
in that house for fourteen years, and for fourteen years my sisters and brother
and I jammed our beds against walls so as not to be exposed on all sides as we
slept.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The day we moved out of the
house, we had to stay in a motel that night en route to our new city of
residence.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That night, in the hotel, I
slept with my back to the room for the first time in fourteen years.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>By
July of 1977, my sisters had married and moved out, and the paranormal activity
increased.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I was fourteen that year, and
my brother eleven. This is the summer the aforementioned flag incident
occurred.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That same summer, as we
prepared to move, I kept finding cupboard doors open in the kitchen, and my
mother is NOT that kind of housekeeper.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>She tried to play it off as myself or my brother playing pranks, but she
was clearly disturbed by it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In the
summer of 1975, I finally had my own room as the two oldest sisters had moved
out.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I had put the two twin beds
together in an &quot;L&quot; shape.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>One
summer morning I made my bed as usual, then had a friend over.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We ended up playing Barbies in the basement
due to heat.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The basement was quiet and
comfortable that day.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My brother was off
at a friend's, Dad was at work, and Mom was stripping and waxing the kitchen
floor.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Because of her floor work, all
pets were outside all day.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>No one could
have entered or left the house without Mom seeing and hearing them.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Twice that afternoon I went up to my bedroom
to get more toys, and each time I found my beds in complete disarray, with the
covers and bedsheets twisted and pulled every which way.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>There
were many more incidents, but this is turning into &quot;War and
Peace.&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I still have nightmares
about the ghost, or ghosts, although we had a very happy life there other than
the hauntings.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>I'll close by noting
that for many years, my brother and I have meant to return to Sioux City and go
through newspaper and library archives to see if there is any mention of our
house.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He lives in California and I live
in Missouri, so this has never come to pass.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>For the record, my brother and I are both attorneys, two of my sisters
are educators, and the other sister is an executive assistant of a major
insurance company.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We are all
intelligent, well-educated, well-grounded people.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And we almost all agree, we lived in a
haunted house.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My second oldest sister
confessed for years to her own haunting experiences until her own children
became too frightened hearing our talk; now she just purses her lips and issues
non-credible denials.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>When
I was 16 years old (in 1995) my cousin (who was visiting from Clute, Tx.) and I
were sleeping in a back room in my Grandparents home.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This room was really dark at night, not
allowing any light in at night because my grandparents put foil on the
windows.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was even darker that night
because the door was shut to the room.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Something I guess a lot of people do.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>My cousin,<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>who was 22 at the time
and pregnant, asked me if I was ready to go to bed.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Her mother was visiting from out of town with
her and her mother was still awake with my grandmother on the opposite side of
the house.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was probably around 1130
p.m.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I agreed with her that we should go
to bed and we then turned off the t.v.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>We settled into bed and and about 2 minutes later my cousin turned to me
and said, &quot;Angela, there is something in the room with us and it is
standing next to me and in the corner.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It's a man.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In a black suit with
a hat on.&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I could not see her face
because it was so dark in the room. I couldn't see my own hand in front of my
face even if I wanted to.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But I knew she
wasn't playing because of the way her voice sounded.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She was truly terrified.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She turned and dug her face into my shoulder,
wrapped her arms around me and began to weep.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I tried to look in the corner to see if I could see what she saw but I
couldn't bring myself to open my eyes.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>About 10-20 seconds passed and I began to yell for my grandmother from
the room.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Neither one of us would budge
from holding each other.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As each second
passed I held on tighter and tighter to my cousin and waited for my grandmother
and Aunt to come to our rescue, but no one would come.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I must of screamed for my grandmother about
5-6 times before she finally came to the room, opened the door, turned on the
light and yelled, &quot;What's the matter.&quot;<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My cousin and I jumped out of the bed and out
the door.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It took us a couple of minutes
to get the information out.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I come from
a family who definitely believes in good and bad spirits.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This wasn't the first time I had seen
something in my grandmother's home; I had lived with her my entire life until
21 years of age.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My grandmother and aunt
believe in the power of prayer and wanted to go back in that room and pray for
what every spirit was there good or evil to leave.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My aunt asked if I was up for going in there
and praying with her I said yes.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I was
really scared but was trying to push that feeling back.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I felt empowered suddenly with my faith and
was no longer scared.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We both went back
into that back room with grandmother, turned off the lights and began to
pray.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My aunt stood in the same spot my
cousin saw the figure and began to pray.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>My grandmother stayed shortly perhaps 1 minute and left the room and
shut the door behind her.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I was about 6
feet away from my Aunt and at the foot of the bed.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The next thing I'm about to tell you, you
probably won't believe.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As I was
standing there praying out loud I could hear my Aunt praying but could not see
her but I knew she was still standing there.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>As I was praying I saw a speck of light in the opposite corner from my
Aunt and it gradually began to get bigger and bigger.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It floated closer and closer to me until
finally I was embraced in it's soft white presence.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I stood there and continued to talk but I
don't recall what I was saying.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I saw
from the corner where my Aunt was standing her turn around and look at me.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I saw her face!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In this room where before I couldn't even see
my hand in front of my face.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>What was
this?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Thing? Being?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Has something come to help us?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It lasted for about 10-20 seconds and then
suddenly drifted away.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A few minutes
later I left the room.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My Aunt stayed
alone in the dark by herself for probably another 5 minutes.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I sat on the coach in disbelief of what I
just experienced.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I didn't tell anyone
what I had saw.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My Aunt later came out
of the room and said she definitely felt a presence in the corner she was
standing in.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I didn't mention anything
to her because I couldn't believe what I experienced I needed time to absorb
it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>While we were in that room together
had another good spirit come to our assistance?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I know I wasn't afraid when I was embraced in the light.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was the opposite of the feeling I had with
the dark presence.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I felt safe and
soothed to the point of a quiet soft weep of pure happiness.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Several years passed before I brought the
subject up with my Aunt.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In 1999 my Aunt
came to visit because my grandmother had been diagnosed with terminal cancer
and was dying.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was very late at night
and everyone was asleep except she and I.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>We were watching t.v.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>when I
turned and began to talk to her. &quot;Aunt Molly do you remember that night
when Julie saw the dark man in the back room?&quot;<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She looked at me and replied,
&quot;Yes.&quot; I was anxious to ask but I did anyways, &quot;Well when you
and I went back there to pray did you see what I saw.&quot;<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She continued to look at me and said,
&quot;Yes, your talking about the light, right?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I said, &quot; Yes, I thought I was the only one but I saw you turn
around and look at me.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For the past
three years I started to convince my self I probably was making it up in my
head.&quot; She replied, &quot;No Angela it was there and it was something
special.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was standing behind you and
I could see you too.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I heard you
speaking but could not understand the words.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>You were speaking in a language I couldn't understand.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>-Many
religions believe that when empowered or enlighted with the good spirit.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>People can speak in tongues which is a
language evil can not understand.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Had
this happened?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Or was I mumbling?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Who knows.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I know it's going to be hard for people to believe this story.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Shoot I have a hard time believing it
happened after all these years.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>But
maybe just maybe when you read this story and you feel that little good
something in you that you feel when you draw strength or are scared or at
church maybe it's that good being that protects us all that's telling you this
story is true.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>After looking over your site and reading
some of the articles, I decided to share a couple of my own experiences with
you.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>The first one that clearly comes to mind
happened with a friend of mine present. I had just opened a pack of cigarettes
and smoked one. We were both in my living room sitting on the furniture across
the room from each other. I laid the pack of cigarettes on the arm of the chair
I was sitting in. My friend and I chatted for seveal minutes when I decided to
have another cigarette. I reach for them and found that they had disappeared.
Neither he nor I had moved from our respective sitting places in this time. We
both searched the living room top and bottom but never did find the pack of
cigarettes anywhere. We even searched the inside and under the chair I was
sitting in. The smokes were just gone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>The second experience happened many years
later in another state in a different part of the country. I was married by
this time. I came home from work for lunch one day. I lived close enough to my
job so I could do this occasionally. Having eaten, I then went back to work. At
quitting time I found that my keys were missing. I looked everywhere at work
for them and finally had to call my wife to come pick me up. She teased me
endlessly for misplacing my keys. We finally found the keys about three months
later in a jacket in the back of our closet. She says I must have put the keys
in the pocket and forgotten where I had put them. The only thing was is that
the day I lost them, I hadn't been wearing a jacket. I certainly didn't wear
one back to work. And even if I had left the keys in this jacket, how was I
able to drive the car to work? The keys would have been left at home!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>There have been other examples of things
disappearing to be found somewhere else, shelves falling for no apparent reason
(usually the same shelf over and over). I have gotten use to these things
happening and attribute it to a poltergeist. This particular entity doesn't
seem to be interested in harming anybody and has never taken anything of value.
Also the occurences only seem to happen from time to time with no particular
pattern. I am certain that this entity is pretty harmless and seems to enjoy
playing harmless pranks on me. I usually ignore these types of events and
attribute them to &quot;my poltergeist&quot;.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>As of this writing, it's been a while since
something of this nature has happened, but I keep wondering what it'll do next.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Hello
let me start by complimenting you on your site. It is wonderful. I apologize
because this is going to be rather lengthy, also I don't mean to offend any
person or religion these are only my beliefs about my experiences.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>My
first encounter with the unknown was when I was around 7 or 8 years old. My
grandmother was considering buying a very old house and she took me and my
mother to look at it. The house was located in Sarasota Florida. When we
entered the driveway I remember getting the chills and began to feel very
uneasy. As we approached the house there was a big pile of furniture and
personal belongings in the yard. I got out of the car and felt like someone was
watching me (it was the first time I ever really remember being scared). To
shorten this story we looked at the house and the stuff in the yard. The stuff
in the yard contained old pictures and personal things of that nature. As we
were leaving I told my mom and grandmother that someone had died there. I don't
know why I said this but come to find out there had actually been several
deaths through out the years at this house (my grandmother looked into the
history of the house and discovered this). The last death in the house resulting
in the house being for sale. The last death in the house was an old lady who
died of natural causes while sleeping. Needless to say my grandmother didn't
purchase the house. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I
had many other &quot;small&quot; occurrences while I was growing up but none
worth mentioning until I was an adult. I should also mention that I found out
from my father that he used to sneak into the basement as a child and watch his
grandmother, mother and sister perform séances. He claims to have watched the
table float around in the basement and as he put it other strange things
happened. He didn't like to talk about it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>At
the age of about 27 my soon to be wife and I moved into a old house (pre wwII).
One night while we were lying in a bed an old man walked by our bedroom door. I
said &quot;Do you see him&quot; and Heather said &quot;yes&quot; at which point
the old man turned and looked at us and then walked into our children's room
(we each had a child from a previous relationship). I jumped out of bed and
went into their room and he was gone. After that little things began to happen
quite regularly. We would see something out of the corner of our eye. One time
the baby stroller rolled and Heather thought that it rolled down the floor (it
was an old house and the foundation had settled causing the house to sink
slightly to the center) but the stroller rolled up the floor. We never had any
problems with our guest and just learned to accept him. I should mention that
around this time I started studying Wicca which comes into play during my next
encounter.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Later
that same year we had moved to another house and things got real freaky. One
night we had put the kids to bed but they wouldn't go to sleep and kept whining
and crying. I finally went into the room and asked what the problem was. Zack
said the man on the wall and just repeated that so I asked Ronnie the oldest of
the two what Zack was talking about and he said right there daddy, pointing to
the ceiling, the man on the roof is scaring us. I of course saw nothing. I
could tell both boys were scared so I told them to come with me to the living
room. My living room and kitchen were separated by a breakfast bar, as we
walked to the end of the breakfast bar Ronnie froze in his tracks and turned
pale. I asked him what was wrong and he said the bunny rabbit under the table,
pointing under the kitchen table. I said go get him and put my hand on his back
and he reacted violently screaming no and literally climbed up me burying his
face in my neck. At this exact time a cat began meowing at our window and was
solid black. Heather was getting ready for work (she worked midnight shift) and
was starting to get nervous. As I stated earlier I had been studying Wicca.
Well Wicca teaches that a familiar will find you and I thought that's what was
happening so I wanted to let the cat in the house. My wife objected. I calmed
everybody down including my wife who was ready to call in sick to work and
decided the boys would sleep in my bed tonight. That settled my wife left for
work. Less than three minutes after she left my telephone rings (mind you it is
after 11:00 pm). I answer the phone and its my wife at the gas station right up
the road and she is frantic. She states as she was leaving she looked back and
at the back door (the backdoor is in the kitchen) there was a bright figure
standing at the door on the inside. She was stuttering and fighting to get the
words out. She wanted me to take the kids and leave the house. Well me and all
my wisdom told her all I had to do was let the cat in everything would be fine.
After about 5 minutes of arguing she reluctantly agreed to letting the cat
inside. While laying in bed neither one of the boys would go to sleep they just
kept staring at the dresser not saying anything. I finally asked what they were
looking at Ronnie said the bunny rabbit is there. I said out loud
&quot;whatever you are go away and leave us alone&quot;, both boys were asleep
in less than 5 minutes. We never had another problem in that house, but a few
things should be mentioned. The cat turned out to be the neighbors and we gave
it back to them but it would always return to our house and sit on the window
sill and meow. The neighbors finally just gave us the cat (my wife nor I are
very fond of cats by the way). The other important thing that happened in this
house was one night I was sitting in bed with two Wicca books reading them and
suddenly felt very confused and lost I stated out loud &quot;I need help
someone please show me the way&quot; and put the books beside the bed and went
to sleep. When I woke up in the morning I looked down at the Wicca books and
got sick to my stomach and had to fight back from vomiting. Needless to say I
stopped studying Wicca. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>After
all of this my wife confessed to me that she has also had several run ins with
ghosts in her past the most amazing being a pregnant murder victim. She lived
in a house that a woman was murdered in. She found this out after strange
things began to happen in the house and she began to question people about the
house. The most common thing that would happen was the baby food jars in the
kitchen would be moved all over the kitchen. One time while she was in the
kitchen a wooden spoon was thrown across the room and hit the wall. Another
time she received a call from her mother who demanded she go check on her son
Heather finally agreed and when she entered Zack's room he was in the crib with
a blanket wrapped around his neck and covering his face. Heather's mom told
Heather that a screaming banshee just ran through the house and she called all
three of her children and told them to check their children.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>It's
almost over I promise. This is the one with the religious overtones. We had
moved again closer to my work. The house we moved into was built in 1916, I
believe, and was one of only a few that had survived a hurricane in 1926. The house
was in Moore Haven Florida. Heather and I had started attending church. One
night while I was at work (I worked second shift) Heather called me telling me
that a little boy was running through our house yelling &quot;daddy&quot;. Both
of our boys were gone for the weekend. I was disturbed by this and approached a
friend of mine who was guiding me in my new found religious beliefs. I
approached him and said &quot;I need to talk to you I have a problem&quot; my
friend started crying (oh by the way did I mention we worked in a prison as
correctional officers). He said &quot;the Holy Spirit told me you needed help
tonight we need to go to your house and pray&quot; I never told this man what
my problem was but he knew. I called my wife and told her I was bringing two
people home from work with me to pray over our house. She was confused but said
ok. After work we went to my house and prayed for about twenty minutes and
never had anything else happen in this house.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I
was told one time that you could record graves and here things in them. One
night my brother in law and I decided to give it a try. So we set off to an old
graveyard (there were many people buried there from the hurricane of 1926). We
recorded one full tape front and back of various graves. We would start the
recording state the name of the person, year born and died and anything else of
value written on the tombstone. We would then place the tape recorder mic down
on top of the grave and walk away so we wouldn't disturb the recording. We
never left eyesight of the grave. Afterwards we went to my house and listened
to the tape. Out of all the graves there was one and only one that we heard
anything. We heard what sounded like growling and moaning. The only thing that
was different about this grave was that it was a high ranking mason. My wife
and my brother in laws wife also heard the tape and the sounds. The tape has
since been lost and we have never repeated this experiment. I was wondering if
you have ever heard of this before?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>It
has been about 4 years since we have had any encounters. We have moved out of
the state of Florida. I firmly believe you have to seek out these encounters or
you will never see or hear anything. I don't tell these stories very often
because people look at you like your nuts. I have a fascination of the spirits
and have lately found myself looking a lot more on the internet for stories. I
would like to here back from you.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Oh
yeah almost forgot while my wife and I were on our honeymoon in St. Augustine
Florida we took a ghost tour. While the guide was telling a story in front of
the cemetery my wife and I saw a person walk across the cemetery. No one else
saw it and when we said did you see that everyone laughed at us and the guide
got annoyed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I
live in Franklin, Vermont. Its a small town about 5 minutes away from the
border. My house is over 100 years old and many people have lived here. I only
know of one who has died here. An old woman who had diabetes and because of
this had a leg removed. Her bedroom was in what is now our washroom, when you
walk through the dining room it feels like you are being watched, and the door
of the washroom has the tendency to crack open ever so slightly. Which gives
the feeling even more. In the living room there is a hole in the ceiling for a
heating pipe, and the room above it is my moms bedroom. Some times when your in
the living room you can very cleary hear someone walking around in her bedroom
and humming. It sounds like a middle aged woman. At night when everyone is
upstairs it sounds like someone is walking back and forth from the kitchen,
through the dining room to the living room. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Currently
there are only two people living here, myself included, and during the early
evening when I am usually here alone I can hear people talking in the far end
of the house. Its always two people and you can never quite make out what they
are saying. Friends have wittnessed things too. A friend of mine who was
staying here came up to go to bed after I had gone a few hours before. The next
morning she told me she had heard whispering on the far end of the room most of
the night. When my mother and I went on vacation and had some friends house sit
they told us when we came home that they had heard foot steps upstairs and
muffled talking.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I've
seen the shapes of what look like a man and sometimes a woman move out of the
corner of my eye. It always feels like there are people here even when you are
alone, though it has quiteted down here in the last few months there are still
random bumps and far off conversations to be heard at night.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>My
nan has told me of her experience so i thought i'd share it with you. It
happened when she was holidaying in our home country of Malta. She was sitting
alone on the hotel balcony one evening, enjoying a drink when she heard loud
music. She looked across and saw another hotel opposite the one she was staying
in and saw that there were people having a party. She looked over and saw they
were welcoming her and telling her to come over. Obviously with the family in
the room, she declined the invitation and went to bed. The next morning she
went out onto the balcony to find that there was no hotel. Everyone tells her
it must have been a dream but she is sure that it is the truth.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>My
father also had a ghostly experience. When he was younger he shared a room with
his brother who had a chair at the end of his bed. One night my dad woke up
looked up and saw a middle-aged lady. She was dressed in black and when he
looked closer, she was standing next to an old man who was sitting on the
chair. He screamed to his mum, and the figures vanished. He now dismisses this
as a dream that he woke up too, as he is VERY sceptical, but I still believe it
really did happen.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

few weeks after school ended my mom made arrangements with my aunt for me so i
could go to cape cod with them. so my dad drove me up there and we shared my
cousin Dustin's room (he slept on the bed and i slept on the floor.) my dad
left the next day and i had the whole room to myself. the next night i slept on
the bed where he had slept and something woke me up in the middle of the night
around two PM i saw this pale girl maybe around 5 years old and she was
laughing and she had a doll in her had .(when i first arrived at my aunts house
that room was very cold.) i turned around and i thought i was going crazy. the
next night i woke up at the same time and i saw the same girl with the same
doll staring at me but this time it was different the whole room was filled
with ghost everywhere you looked there was a ghost. the next day i asked my
cousin how old this house was he said it was over 200 years old ... and 15
people died in it. i totally freaked out.the next day my cousin went out to
play and we saw a man it a white tux walking around the garden my cousin and i
dropped everything and ran so quickly we didn't have time to look back. we told
my other cousin juliette (she had experienced ghost before and she has some
special type of power to see ghost)<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>what
we had saw and she didn't believe us. until she saw it for her self. me and
Julie were home alone and it was pitch black and she was waiting for her
boyfriend Jake to come over she looked out the window and saw the ghost she
freaked out.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>from that day on we had
&quot;slumber parties &quot; in my cousin Dustin's room and stayed up all night
hoping for that girl to show up but she never did (all we heard was knockings

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Let me introduce myself. My name is Amber S.
and I am from a town right outside of Pittsburgh, PA now called South Park
(Formerly Snowden and Library). You may have seen on TV specials about the
famous Green Man's Tunnel, Corvette Bend, etc. but the things I have
encountered while residing here in south park put these &quot;famous
ghost&quot; sights to shame. The places these ghost hunters and paranormal
experts should be investigating is the old coal mining houses in Library and
the apartments in which I used to live, Park Place. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I've always believed in ghosts and the
paranormal because I have had encounters since I was a little girl. The first
aparition which I saw happened one night as I lay in bed. I must have been
around 6 at the time. I opened my eyes and there was this white flowing object
raised in the air just floating. It had what almost looked to be a wooden head.
It had no facial features and did not speak to me. This &quot;ghost&quot;
however did paralize me, and I couldn't speak nor move. I tried to call out to
my Grandmother, but when I went to call out there was no sound. I must have
passed out from fear because that is all I remember after that. I moved from
that apartment into another building and nothing ever happenned that I recall
when I moved to that one. I did have an out of body experience however when I
move to that building, but nothing happened as far as ghost encounters. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I
lived in 2 different apartments in the other building and I moved back to
building 1 the first one I lived in. I moved into the apartment directly
underneath the one in which I had my first vision. My mother's boyfriend is
Native American. He moved into that apartment with us and strange things
started to happen. He said he ad visions all of his life but never told anyone
untill he told my mom. There were many things that happened so I will tell you
things I remember. He was always getting visions and these ghosts would talk to
him. His sister would stay with us a lot and she got these visions too. One
night, her and I were in my room and shut the lights out to try and go to
sleep. You know when there's a door shut and the hallway light is on or
whatever you can see through the crack of where the door shuts? Well I was
laying there and I was looking at the crack and there was this blackness that
kept filling the crack, moving up and down in the crack and I watched this for
like 5 mins. and I said to Maryann &quot;What the hell is that?&quot; and she
started freaking out and was like &quot;OMG you see it too?&quot; and I said
&quot;Yeah, why didn't you say anything??&quot; and she said because she didn't
want to scare me. She asked me what I was seeing and I told her, but I found
out I saw only a portion of what she was seeing. She said they were like green
bear claws moving up and down the door and I was seeing it's shadows. We
started yelling for my mom and her boyfriend Chuck and they came in after about
5 minutes because they thought we were just messing around. When they came in
we told them what happened. We were so scared we didn't want to get out of the
bed to turn on the light. So when they came in they brought our dog in too
because you know how animals have extremely good senses. We turned the lights
out to see if it happened again but instead Maryann saw this person who was
trying to pose as her dead cousin who was killed in a fire. She knew it wasn't
him because he had these evil green glowing eyes. Our dog was growling like
crazy. A few minutes later another person appeared and I think this actually
was a dead family member. But these ghosts they like dwelled in my house and
most of them were bad. I remember my brother had interactive Buzz &amp; Woody
toys from the movie and the ghosts would go in there in the middle of the night
and push he buttons and make them talk and they would push his toy trucks that
made noises when you pushed the buttons and stuff. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>My friend said one day she was walking down
the apartment hall to her apartment and this spirit that had no head and
started chasing her down the hall. She beat him to her apartment but said when
she shut the door behind her it was like something ran into the door. She told
me how terrified she was. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Chuck has a nephew named Corey. He is probably
the most, I guess you could say psychic, of them all. He fell out of a 3 story
window when he was like 3 or something and didn't have a scratch on him. He
said his angel saved him. He was over my house one day and he was playing with
my brother who is roughly the same age and they came out of the room and was
telling us of how they were playing with the big white angel in his room. The
haunting in my apartment started to get really bad. I started to be so scared
all of the time that I couldn't sleep. We even had a priest come and bless our
house to try and get the spirits to leave but it didn't work.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Corey's Mom would be on the phone with my mom
while Corey would go into these trances. He would tell us when ghosts would be
in our house or on there way to our house and our phone would always shut off
while Corey was trying to relay these messages. When we were at Coreys house
one night, a lot of strange things started to happen. We were in the living
room and they had this clock waterfall. We went to shut it off but it wouldn't
and so we pulled the plug and it was still working. Then the notebook in which
my mom kept a journal of everything that happened went flying across the room
and then all the pots and pans fell out of the cupboard. We heard these voices
talking too.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Chuck always saw spirits walk across our
living room, he even said there were 2 of them that ended up in the shower with
him one day. I don't know what to make of it. We moved out of that apartment
and the people that moved in next was a family with real religious parents. The
girl that moved in told me that weird stuff would be going on. Door knobs
turning, doors locking, etc. She said her mom even put Bible pages under the
carpets and stuff. They eventually moved out because of a water problem, which
we had when we lived there too. There are many more stories about ghost
encounters with my whole family but I would be writing for 5 more hours. It
just seems every house my family moves into is haunted by something. Either
that, or we just pick up on presence more easily than most. I think that South
Park could be investigated. It's like an old coal mining town. My boyfriend
Marcus lives in one of the old mining houses in Library that was built in 1912.
He'll get locked out of his house, you'll always feel cold spots. His dogs will
start starring for no reason or looking around the room with there eyes fixed
on something we can't see. Or they'll start growling or barking at something we
can't see. He had this candle on top of his TV that would always fly off. He'll
hear noises that I won't. He actually saw the ghost that haunts his house. He
said he was an older man, with a red plaid shirt on. He said he had like grease
or coal stains on his hands. He said he looked at him and then walked through
the door outside. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>There's also a cemetery which I beleive is
Haunted right down the street from me. Marcus, my friend Jackie and I went to
it one day and weird stuff happened to all of us for atleast a couple of weeks
after that. When we were there I saw this black figure, almost like the Grim
Reaper. A sign blocked my way for just a moment and when I passed the sign the
figure was gone. I thought it was a person at first but after walking past the
sign and it disapearing, knew it had been a ghost. While we were in the
cemetery Marcus started talking to this tombstone. After we left it was almost
like he was in a trance and he kept walking into the street off the side of the
road where we were supposed to be walking. We were walking up my hill and
Marcus asked if we heard that little kid screaming and crying and we said no. I
went home that night and me and Jackie were in bed to go to sleep. I dozed off
and there was a little girl with black hair and she was screaming bloody murder
just looking at me like I had to help her and I jumped up and was like Oh my
God and Jackie asked what happened and I told her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>I've felt angel presence, The Virgin Mary's
presence. Maybe my stories seem far fetched. I don't know. All I know is I saw
what I saw, felt what I felt and I'm telling you what others have told me. Take
from it what you want or if you have questions ask them. Like I said, there are
many more stories, some of which I'm sure I don't even know. Hope you enjoyed
some of this. If you could write back to let me know you've recieved this it
would be greatly appreciated.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>From 1993 til about 1997 I was assigned as a
K-9 Patrol Officer with my current employer the Altoona City Police
Department.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My K-9 partner,
&quot;Alan&quot;, was a well trained &amp; great performing (awesome, loyal,
courageous &amp; excellent) 125lb black German Shepard from Europe.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He never showed any fear at any time &amp;
was extremely aggressive &amp; protective when he was supposed to be.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>We had answered several alarm calls at
Baker's Mansion during our time together, all of which were determined to be
false alarms with no explanation (not unusual).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I am familiar with the ghostly tails of the Mansion to include a tale
from an electrician friend of mine but I'm the type that &quot;I don't really
believe until I actually see&quot;.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>If
it matters I am Christian and have never communicated with what I believe to be

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Anyway, the last alarm call &quot;Alan&quot;
&amp; I answered at Baker's Mansion was a strange one.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The alarm came in during &quot;shift
change&quot;, Midnight, between 2nd shift &amp; 3rd shift (my shift).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A 2nd shift officer backed me up on the call
(I was dispatched from &quot;roll-call&quot;).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>It was in the late fall to early winter, the air crisp w/ a light wind
&amp; leaves blowing.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As we checked the
exterior &amp; grounds of Baker's Mansion, nothing seemed out of place &amp;
everything was secure.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Although my K-9
seemed to be his normal self, I remember a very unsettling feeling.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The same type feeling a police officer often
gets when there is danger near but yet discovered (6th sense if you wish to
call it &amp; many officers, including myself, believe it's either God or a
guardian angel warning you).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As we
approach the front door &amp; stand-by for an &quot;emergency contact
person&quot; to arrive with keys to check the interior, I advise the other
officer of my strange feeling &amp; to be on guard for someone within (unauthorized).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He also seems very serious.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The &quot;contact person&quot; arrives with
the keys &amp; opens the front door for us to check the interior.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Usually we have no problem allowing the
&quot;contact person&quot; to enter with us (if we believe the alarm to be
false with a secure exterior) but, even though the exterior was found to be
secure, I'm following my instinct &amp; advise this person to wait at the
door.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Once we enter my K-9 partner immediately
lowers his head, stops just inside the door with hair raised on his back &amp; neck,
lowers his body to the floor, snarls &amp; takes off inside &amp; up the steps
to the 2nd floor.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I've seen K-9
&quot;Alan&quot; like this many times before usually indicating that he either
smells, sees or senses someone within &amp; is going to find this person &amp;
latch onto him with no mercy. So, figuring that &quot;Alan&quot; is onto
something, I chase my dog up the steps to the 2nd floor ( the dog bypasses the
2nd floor). We are both fully alert &amp; gung-ho to catch a burglar.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Alan&quot; then continued up another
flight of stairs to the 3rd floor (library), I follow.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The other Officer waits at the foot of the
1st floor steps.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Alan&quot; runs
head-long down the hall next to the library &amp; at some point &quot;puts on
the brakes&quot; sliding past a point (unseen to my eye) at the wall separating
the hall from the library.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>&quot;Alan&quot; rushes up to a spot/area of the wall, still snarling w/
hair raised &amp; all (on full alert) and now starts to aggressively bark at
this point in the wall.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He looks around
(also up &amp; down) and then tilts his head in confusion.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>&quot;Alan' hurredly runs back towards me
&amp; into the library itself.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I follow
cautiously, now with my gun drawn (I fully expect to hear the scream of a
burglar as my dog gets a bite).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He runs
fully into the library &amp; right to the same wall (but now inside the
library), approx. same spot as when previously in the hall but now on the
opposite side, and continues with the same aggressive behavior &amp; barking
too.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Again, he becomes confused, looking
about, then pauses &amp; runs back out of the library (still excited, snarling
&amp; aggressive) &amp; back to the same spot in the hall wall and again
displays the same behavior towards the wall.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>&quot;Alan&quot; proceeds to repaet all of the same, back &amp; forth
from hall to library &amp; concentrating on that same area/spot of the wall
each time for about another three cycles.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I am now even more alert as I am troubled by his confusion (wondering
where this obvious intruder may be) yet this is the exact behavior he displays
when &quot;man-hunting&quot;. I mean this is the same behavior he displays (as
I've witnessed so many times before) when locating a suspect hiding in a closet
(or such) yet this is a point in the interior wall separating the hall from the
library.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>After the 3rd or 4th cycle
(he's now again in the hall) &quot;Alan&quot; just instantly stops what he's
doing (again at that same spot/area of the wall), tilts his head in confusion
again (panting), looks back &amp; forth from me to the spot in the wall a few
times, completely calms down &amp; walks back to me (looking back over his
shoulder to the wall a few times) &amp; sits next to my left leg just looking
at that area of the wall (as if the problem just disappeared.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Now confused, &amp; yes alittle nervous, I
call the other officer up to my location on the 3rd floor (the K-9 team is
usually left to work an area themselves without other officers in the way
unless requested) and I quickly explain what had just happened.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That feeling of &quot;alert&quot; has now
left me &amp; obviously has left K-9 &quot;Alan&quot;.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The other officer &amp; I then thoroughly
search the 3rd floor &amp; the remainder of the mansion (I still half expected
to find something wrong) with K-9 &quot;Alan&quot; now just following me
(again, another strange behavior displayed by the dog as he usually leads) but
not &quot;on alert&quot;.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Nothing amiss
was discovered in the mansion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Still confused about the whole thing I then
return to the original start of the trouble (yes, that same area of wall on 3rd
floor) looking for vents that may carry scent &amp; confuse the dog. Nothing
found.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I considered the possibility of
an animal (mouse, squirrel, rat) being present but I knew from experience that
&quot;Alan&quot; has never reacted that way when dealing with an animal (he
always reacts in a very happy &amp;/or playful manner).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Before giving up (at that time) I put plenty
of thoughout &amp; investigation into the strange occurrence &amp; could come
up with nothing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Eventually I yelled for the &quot;emergency
contact&quot; to enter the mansion &amp; I explained to him what had happened
&amp; took him to the location.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He
jokingly made reference to &quot;ghost&quot; &amp; giggled it off.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I noticed that the other officer (a seasoned
&quot;salt&quot; veteran) got very nervous &amp; even more serious. By now I
had calmed &amp; was just plain confused with my dog's behavior. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>As the &quot;emergency contact person&quot;
reset the alarm, the other officer &amp; I walked outside together.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I mentioned to the other officer that I had
noticed how serious he became with the &quot;emergency contact person&quot;
&amp; asked if he had a problem with the guy.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>This officer (a former K-9 officer) told me that the possibility of a
&quot;ghost&quot; being involved is no joke.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>The Mansion was locked up again &amp; we all
left.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The other Officer requested that
we meet somewhere else as he wanted to tell me something.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We met-up elsewhere &amp; explained to me
that some years ago (prior to my employment with the Department) he &amp; his
K-9 were on an alarm call at Baker's Mansion one night.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This was the 1st time for his K-9 at the
Mansion.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>checked the exterior secure and he noticed
that his dog had his tail between his legs, hair up on it's back &amp; neck and
was acting very strange.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The dog even
hesitated to go to the front doors.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When
the &quot;emergency contact person&quot; arrived &amp; opened the front door,
the K-9 Officer had to force his dog in through the door (this type of
behavior, for his dog, was extremely unusual as this dog was extremely
aggressive, just shy of being too &quot;out of hand&quot;).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Once the dog was &quot;pushed&quot; in
through the front door the dog yelped, turned &amp; ran back out (almost
knocking the handler over) and continued straight into the K-9 vehicle.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Officer attempted to get his dog out of
the cruiser without success.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Officers
checked the interior finding nothing (false alarm).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The Officer added that he was never able to
get his dog to ever go back into the Mansion for any other alarms at that
location<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>ever again.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This was not the case anywhere else &amp; the
dog never displayed that type of behavior before or after with the exception of
Baker's Mansion.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That officer told me
that although he does not really believe in ghosts, he never felt comfortable
at Baker's Mansion &amp; his dog confirmed for him that there is something
&quot;not right&quot; there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>As for my dog, we never worked an alarm
together at Baker's Mansion again and he had never displayed that type of
behavior again (before or after).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Thus,
I cannot explain what had happened &amp; have never found an explanation.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I even mentioned the incident to my (K-9)
trainer who at first giggled and then seriously mentioned that dogs have a much
keener sense and added that he has heard of similar stories before.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>My conclusion: I don't know!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Although I'll agree with my colegue, there's
&quot;something not right&quot; about that place &amp; I seem to feel it each
&amp; every time I go there (my K-9 partner has since deceased).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>Thought you might find this personal
experience interesting.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I have told it

about two years ago, I got a <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>part-time

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>experiences
there, I decided that its best to acknowledge all the things <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>around
us, especially the ones we dont fully understand.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I
worked at the church for several months with no odd occurrences, but then, <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>out
of no where, all sorts of strange things began to happen.<span

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>work

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>pastor.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Many times while working I would hear noises
coming from the <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>upstairs
youth rooms or the fellowship hall.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Each
time I would go to see if <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>someone
had entered the church (which was kept locked at all times), but no <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>one
was ever there.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Sometimes the noises
would be foot steps or doors <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>opening
or closing, and other times I would hear whispery voices but never <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>actual
words.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>After a while, I just had to
mention it to the pastor because <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>it
was getting to the point where I was afraid to go to work.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The pastor <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>admitted
that he too had heard noises in the church and upon investigation <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>found
nothing.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He also related that he
believed that he and his wife had <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>seen
ghosts in the yard of the parsonage (on the same lot as the church).<span

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>The
pastor and I agreed to keep all of this to ourselves for fear that the <o:p></o:p></span></p>

would think we were crazy.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We also
agreed, however, that we <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>would
each do our best to never be alone in the church.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>As
time passed we became accustomed to the strange noises and even joked on <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>a
few occasions about how spooked we had been before.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I now look back and <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>regret
those jokes because it seems that the spirit didnt find them as <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>funny
as we did.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The strange noises began to
get louder and louder and much <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>more
frequent.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I never SAW any objects
moving, but I KNOW that I heard <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>banquet
tables being dragged in the fellowship hall and the swinging doors <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>between
there and the offices slamming on many occasions.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When I felt brave <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>enough
to investigate, I would find the doors still gently swinging and <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>tables
strewn about the hall.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Many times, I
would turn off all the lights <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>in
the building to go out to lunch and return to find all them turned on <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>again.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>These things happened both while I was alone
and when the pastor was <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>present.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We both agreed that this time the happenings
seemed less <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>mischievous
and more meant to scare us.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Once, upon
mentioning it to the <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Youth
Minister, she confessed that she didnt like to work in her office <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>alone
at night because of a frightening presence that she sometimes felt <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>around
her.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>At times, she said, she felt as
though someone were standing <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>directly
behind her only to turn and find no one there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>All
of these things weighed on me, but being a rational-minded person, I <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>continued
to dismiss my fears and shrug away my worries and kept this secret <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the three of us.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>One night, however, in
order to finish the monthly <o:p></o:p></span></p>

I was working late at the church all alone.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>by
before he went out for dinner to ensure me that he was only a phone call <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>away
if I needed him.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I assured him that I
was fine, and he went on his <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>way.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I worked for about an hour with no
problems.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>All was quiet.<span

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I
was sitting at my computer, I heard the sound of paper rustling very near <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I turned and looked around the room and saw
nothing amiss.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I decided <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the rational that the sound of the music would cover any ghostly <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>murmurings.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I pushed play on the stereo and turned back

of that church faster than Ive ever run in my whole life!<span

way to my car, started it up, and sped off without looking back!<span

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I
was visiting a friend a while that day, and my friend had asked me to run to
the store for her. As I started to leave, a Toy Collie came up to me<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(like it was looking for guidance). I felt
bad for the dog and tried to think of what to do with her. Yes, she was going
to have pups. I put her in the yard and shut the gate behind me. My friend's
daughter, called a friend of hers and she told me that her friend's dad, would
come to pick me and the dog up.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>When
I came back from the store, the father of her friend was there with his
daughter, and the dog was gone. But, that wasn't the interesting part. When he
and his daughter walked through the door, I felt a presence that walked in with
them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I
had asked him if there was anyone close to him that had passed awway recently,
he &quot;well, my daughter (oldest) passed away about a year ago.&quot; I said,
ok.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I
could smell Tacos and guacamole. I had asked him what that was about, and he
said that she always loved to eat out at Taco Bell. Once I had established
that, I suggested that we go to her gravesite.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Once
we happened on the headstone, I put my hands on it, it wasn't what I had ever
expected. It had a lot of activity going on. Basically, she was not at rest.
After this took place, we went to his place of residence. And what I picked up
from there was nothing I had ever expected either.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>As
we went down the driveway, I noticed that it was gravel, all the way to the
house. But when we got to the house, there was approximately a 20*20ft area
that was nothing but concrete. It was probably already 105 degrees outside as
it was, but, when I got out of the car, it was like standing in an oven that
felt like 300 degrees. My intuition was so getting stronger, that all emotion
from everyone that was there, was overwhelming. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I
went into the house and what I felt at that particular moment was undescribable.I
felt nothing but unadulterated, evil. Mind you, as it was, I didn't trust this
man to save my life.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>But,
for what it was worth, I kept on with what I was driven to do. He happened to
tell me about a set of twin boys who supposedly lived on that property a long
time ago (for which I did not believe), that these kids' father had punished
them and locked them in a well, leaving them to die.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>What
came to me next, also helped these restless spirits. The man who's daughter
passed away, had kidnapped thes two boys, locked them in the well, and used
them as a sacrifice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I
didn't tell him that though. because, it would have been a dangerous situation
for me, my son, my friend, and boyfriend at the time. So, I just dealt with
things the things at hand. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>After
going through some of property, and the house, we went to where the daughter
used to live with her boyfriend, and point of where she died.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>The
house she lived in was a little newer than the one she grew up in. But, I stood
upon what used to be a basement and crawl space, stairs leading up to the
second floor and the exact spot where she layed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>She
had showed me exactly what happened to her, as well as, who had killed her. Her
father had been, all this time, blaming her boyfriend. But, it what she showed
me that told me otherwise. Before we went to this spot, I spoke with a former
firefighter who had been one of the original people to be called to the scene.
He told me that both of her wrists were broken, and both of her ankles were
broken. Standing at the point of where she died she showed what had happened to
her. She showed me that she and her dog were in the living roo, which was
upstairs. Someone had got a hold of a pipe, hitting her with it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>She
tried to get downstairs where the basement and crawlspace were, and had started
going to the crawlspace where she would feel safe. That did not last long, as
she tried to get to her safeplace, the man (I saw a couple minutes later), went
after her. Followed her down the stairs to &quot;finish&quot; the job he had
started. Once he got her immobile, he went upstairs, got a gascan and saturated
the whole place. And the house burned down to the ground. When the fire
department got there, their report stated the cause of the fire was due to
electrical wiring from the airconditioner. And the daughter had been burned
pret badly. So badly, that it covered over 95% of her body. Later on she told
me that all she wanted was for someone to know the truth. If I would have
pursued it, I could have helped bring charges against him for aggravated
manslaughter. But, that's neither here nor there. I did what I had to do and
she now rests in peace. I hope you enjoy this and if you have any questions

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I
actually have a story that's very well known in my part of SE Texas. At least
among the ghost-o-philes like me it is. It has to do with a ghost light that
has been appearing on the same 7-mile long stretch of land (now Bragg's Road)
since back in the mid-1700s when the land was still a railroad. It has sense
become a poorly maintained (but arrow-straight), and rarely used, dirt road.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>But
dating back to reports by conductors and nearby residents (who were few and far
between) a mysterious light (who's color seems to vary from red, to white, to
green, to yellow..... red and white by my personal account) has been reported
as appearing almost every night without fail.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>It
appears on the road, approximately half a mile ahead of you, no matter where on
the road you may be (yes, this means that it moves with you. you can get no
closer to it. and when you're towards the end of the road, it will appear the
same distance behind you) During the 70s and 80s scientific attempts were made
to identify the light. When they failed, however, it spooked the researchers
and since then, the light has been left alone; still appearing almost every night
for whoever wishes to see it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>It
is really a remarkable occurance. It simply hovers ahead of you, about
chest-level off the ground. It doesn't move, but flickers in and out
occasionally, only to wink back into exsistance a minute later. Seeing the extremely
rural settings and the light in the middle of the arrow-straight dirt road is
enough to make even the most skeptical onlooker question if ghosts exsist.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>For
those who wish to find out more, I'm sorry there seems to be no website up
detailing the light. I will work to rectify that, and will submit a link to a
site as soon as I can. In the mean time, I would suggest that seeing is
believing, and that you make a trek to a few miles outside of Livingston, Texas
and see the Bragg's Road Light for yourself.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I
work at a county-run nursing home in Pennsylvania.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A couple of years ago, we had a very nice
lady, Ruth, as a resident.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She was
around 95 years old and reminded me very much of my own great-grandmother, who
is still living. Ruth was very independent and at the time was the only one in
her room who could get up and use the restroom without assistance.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Since she didn't need any help taking care of
herself, I would spend time with Ruth just talking with her and we got
close.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>   </span>When Ruth suddenly got ovarian
cancer, it took her very quickly.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Within
a few months, she died. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>         </span>The county morgue is in our basement,
so when a resident dies we have to wrap them in a shroud to go to the
morgue.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This is not my favorite thing to
do for obvious reasons.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As my co-worker
and I were washing Ruth for the final time before wrapping her, her eyes would
not stay closed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She just kept looking
at me no matter which way we turned her.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>This really creeped me out, but we had been close, so bsp; I brushed it
off.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>          </span>Not long after, the toilet in Ruth's
old room began to flush on it's own.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We
had maintenance in several times to look at it, but they claimed there was
nothing wrong with it.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Even the room's
new residents noticed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This went on for
almost 6 months before it occured to me what was going on.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>So one day after the toilet again flushed
itself I went in and said, &quot; OK, Ruth, I know it's you.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There's no need for you to stay here
anymore.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>You can move on.&quot;<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The flushing went on for a couple more days
and suddenly stopped.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I haven't heard it
since.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I've told this story to several
of my co-workers<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>and every time I do I
get goosebumps<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>In
the mid 1970's my family moved to an older home about ten miles out in the
country.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>About
two months after we moved in, we had an event that replayed for approximately
two years and then ceased.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Our
home sat below the paved road, our driveway was gravel, looped down from the main
road and ran beside the house. At one end of the living room, we had french
doors with full length windows that showed the driveway where it joined the
paved road. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>One
night, the kids and I were watching tv and noticed bright headlights turn into
our drive, we heard the crunch of the tires on the gravel and car doors
slamming. Imagine our surprise when we went to greet our visitors and no one
was there! It happened many, many times over the next couple of years and
really freaked out any company that we had. We were not particularly frightened
(except for the first time), because nothing ever happened except for the
headlights, gravel crunching and car doors slamming.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I
believe this event may have not originated on our property but on the property
at the beginning of our road. In the 1930's and 40's, it had been a rather
fancy resort with a hot pool from the natural hot springs there. In the late
40's it became known as a brothel and gambling spot, not legally of course, but
it was used as such. In the 1960's it changed hands and became a dude ranch
which operated for some years but was never successful. I think that during the
time the brothel, gambling and drinking was going on that there was quite a bit
of violence. Conjecture of course, but my own feelings were that some sort of
violence began at that place and ended at ours. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>My
children still swear up and down that they saw a hanging man in the loft of our
barn. Since I never did, I cannot verify that. My children are all grown now,
but still remember quite vividly our own little brush with the supernatural.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Thanks
for letting me share this, not really a ghost story as such I suppose, but
interesting. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

important and that sometimes they can make themselves visible in our own time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

and our two dogs reside here.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There is a
family of 4 and two dogs that live next to us in this building.<span

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We had only a TV, card table and chairs, dog
beds, and an air mattress.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We were
awaken one night to the sounds of the chairs moving across the hardwood
floors.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We looked around but nothing was
out of place and the dogs were asleep in their beds.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Since our house was empty, we thought it was probably
noises coming from our neighbors side of the house.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then a couple months later we star d hearing
noises coming from the room we use as an office.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The sounds of papers falling, things
knocking, etc.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Still, I wrote it off as
our imagination, until one night.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I was
along in our basement playing PS2.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>First
let me tell you there are no windows in our basement.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They were taken out years prior to us moving
in.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I was sitting in the chair with my
back toward the stairs when I saw a shadowy figure walk in front of me.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I thought it was my husband coming downstairs
to see if I was coming to bed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When I
called out his name and turned around no one was there.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I immediately turned off the TV and went to
bed to find my husband sleeping and both of the dogs in bed sleeping.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I didnt tell him about this until the next
morning, I was too frightened.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My
husband had encounters with our friendly ghosts a few times after that.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He was standing at the front door with the
dogs and heard the door knob rattle as if someone was trying to enter.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He flung the door open but no one was
there.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He heard a pop can rattle on the
desk over and over.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>No windows were
opened, no dogs around, must be the ghosts.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>A year and a half went by and all was quiet.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We would joke about our ghosts and thought
what we had seen and heard was all in our heads.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>/SPAN&gt;This was after the fact that our
neighbors brought up out of the clear blue that they have had similar if not
worse experiences.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We still dismissed
this as ghosts until last spring.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We
woke up at around 2 am with sounds coming from the office.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was a loud pinging noise.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I had my husband take the German Sheppard and
the gun into the room to see if someone was trying to break in.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He found nothing.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He came back to bed when it started
again.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This time I went in to
investigate (with the German Sheppard close to my side).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I looked in the closet, under the desk, under
the table.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Nothing, no rodent,
nothing.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When I went to close the door
to the room, it started again.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I flew
the door open and nothing, it stopped.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I
went back to bed and it started again.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>This time we just put up with it and tried to go back to sleep.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We knew then that our ghosts were
back.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This occurred for many nights to
follow.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Other noises started to occur,
the keyboard on the computer made noise as if someone was typing, the door on
the desk sounded as if someone was playing with the door handle, the jukebox
doors sounded like they were being opened and closed.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This usually happened around the same time
every night.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We tried a few ways to
commun ate with our friends but with no success.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Its been quiet here for the past couple
months but every once in a while we will hear noises.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They dont seem to be upset with the fact we
are residing in their house.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We must be
welcomed guests.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Research of the house
and area has come up empty handed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Base
housing is too hard to investigate.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
house has been since the 50s.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>A lot of
people have come and gone.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The area
where we live is the oldest settlement in the state so there could be a number
of things that haunt this house.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I am no
longer skeptical when it comes to ghosts, I am now a true believer. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>My
name is Dawn and I am eighteen years old.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>When I was twelve or so, my aunt passed away.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My story goes back to the day that
happened.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I was home with just my mom
around.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My aunt had been in the hospital
for having a heart attack - and had to be on a dialosis machine for her liver
for over ten years - that is where she died.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>We got the phone call that precise morning from the hospital - they were
calling to report my aunt was getting pretty bad and didn't have a lot of time
left.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Mom and I both went to start
getting ready - getting shoes on and jackets since it was only March.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I was sitting on the couch of our living room
and something in me told me to look up at the stairs which were across the
room.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When I looked up, I seen the shape
of a white whispy woman who was standing on the stairs and she stayed there for
maybe five seconds.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I turned to my mom
quickly to ask to make sure me and her were the only ones home - which we
were.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>After we got to the hospital, they
told us my aunt died approximately at the same time I had seen the white
figure. <span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Though the white whispy woman
didn't resemble really anyone, I think it was my aunt Helen checking in on me
one last time.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I was her favorite niece
and I had promised to go see her the next week (before we found out about the
heart attack) - she had been begging me to come.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I think she got her wish of seeing me one
more time by appearing on the stairs that day though it had to be after she had
already died.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Tonight
October 31, 2004 myself along with a group of friends visited the East Village
Cemetery. we had drove by about an hour earlier to scope it out all the gates
had been shut but when we returned to enter the cemetery the right gate had
been opened. As soon as we stepped into the cemetery I had a constant feeling
of being watched. As we got to the back of the cemetery we saw a white figure
in the distance followed by what sounded like whispering.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>we future walked in the direction in which
this figure and sounds appeared.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I
myself froze and became very light headed and had an overwhelming feeling of
someone looking directly over my shoulder, 2 of the people I was with continued
to walk closer and closer. I looked to my left and saw what appeared to be a
dark figure popping out from behind the tombstones. Moments later the 2
individuals who continued walking let out a scream and we all bolted out of the
cemetery. I later found out that they had heard footsteps behind them as they
got further down the path and when one of them turned around he saw leaves being
kicked up in the air as if someone was running after them.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This cemetery dates back to the 1700's and is
in my opinion defiantly haunted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

am a 15 year old boy, I at first was the only one that could hear the ghosts in
our house but soon my sisters then my dad were hearing them too. They seem to
come out in the middle of the night and mumble. They only stay in the
livingroom but they get so loud that everyone in the house can hear them. I
don't think they are visible and they are very smart, they will only make noise
if nobody is in the living room, thats awake that is. I only hear them if I'm
in another room. They do not scare me but they do get me curious. I decided to
ask about the history of this house and my mom told me that her first husband
and her dad built this house. Both of them are still alive so it couldn't be
them. I know there are two of because every moring after they come, 2 chairs
would be moved. The only person i know that would be dead are my animals and my
grandmother. I have tried to hear what they say and i was hoping I could do
something to rest their souls but i have had no avail understanding them. I'm
not scared of them but i want to help a people who have had regrets in life.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>ok
i have had alot of visitors in my life time. for as long as i can remember... i
can feel the pain of people passing, and get visions and dreams to tell me to
prepare myself for what is to come. the story today is about my grandfathers
passing. it was in feburary this year.. i dreampt that my great aunt was in the
hospital, i went to visit someone and she started to speak to me in my
language.. (thompson indian) she told me that my grandfather was going to pass
within a week, and that i would become very angry. this startled me as this
aunt of mine had passed away years before. i went to visit my grandfather in
the hospital 2 days later he was there due to complications with cancer.. he
was in remition, but had some scare tissue cause problems. i told him of this
dream and he nodded becoming very peaceful. his sister, my aunt and him had
been very close.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>a week later i was
sitting at home painting a picture. i suddenly got a terrible feeling and
called my brother, i told him to visit my grandfather the next day because
something was going to happen.the next day i went out with a friend, when i
returned home, my mother and brother were waiting for me. this was strange as i
lived 4 hours away from them. they told me that my grandfather had passed away.
we went to my fathers house, he lives down the street from my grandfather. his
house is built on an old native village. because of tradition when someone
passes you light a fire and keep it going until the person is buried to help
their spirit move on.i was sitting in the living room in the house by myself,
there is a big picture window across from the couch i was sitting on.i got a
very uneasy feeling and was paralized. i looked at the window and saw 3
spirits. my cousin amy who had passed 2 years prior, my great uncle and an evil
spirit. she had dark evil looking eyes, long messy hair with twiggs and leaves
in it and red lines on her face that looked like she had been cut deeply. the
two spirits of my family gave me a great sence of peace, but the third, told me
that it was my time, and that she was here to take me.this scared me. later
that week i was sitting amongst my family, we were all talking when i got the
urge to look out the window and saw a great number of spirits with their faces
pressed up against the glass looking at me. they were all sad and looked as if
they had lived some 100 years ago in the very spot our house is built.no one
else saw them but they understand my gift and believed me. the next night i was
sitting around the fire outside with some family when out of nowhere i drew a
picture of a lady in the dirt. i felt this ladies hands on my sholders and it
was conforting. everyone asked me what was wrong. i asked them if they saw this
lady and noone did. at the same time i felt the presence of the evil spirit
standing on the porch behind me, she then came up beind me and grabbed my neck
and proceeded to choke me.she had long sharp dirty finger nails and scratched
my face by my eye.. no one saw her but saw that i was frightened and bleeding,
i told them not to go arounf the front of the house as she was there waiting to
take me and those that ventured alone. i went inside.the next night i was again
sitting around the fire thinking about my grandfather.all of a sudden i felt a
great sence of peace and felt i should look up.when i did i saw my aunt and
grandfather walk up to eachother, hug and walk off holding hands and smiling
and laughing.there were several more experiences that week leading up to his
burial, i talked to my shaman about them, and showed him a picture of the evil
spirit.he got very frightened and told me that he would deal with her because i
had too much to live for and that it was too dangerous.his efforts failed and
she followed me home to a town 4 hours away. a couple of weeks later, i was
ahving coffee late one night with my friend, she also has the gift. i was in
the middle of a conversation when i felt someone blowing in my ear. this was
strange as noone was sitting next to me and we were the only customers. the
evil spirit starting saying that it was my time and she was going to take me. i
told my friend and she said she also heard and saw what had just happened<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>drew a piture and she confirmed what i had
just seen. we decided to leave, we got up to leave and i always keep my keys in
my purse, well when i got to the counter i noticed they were no longer in my
purse, my friend begged my not to go back to the table but i did. my keys on a
long keychain were layed out on the table in a straight line, and as i turned
to leave, felt hand around my neck, i bolted. the spirit has since come to
visit me and has tried 2 times this past summer to take me. both almost
succeding.. the second time was i had picked my friends up from the bar as i
was dding, when i got to the bar i heard a voice in my ear, this is your time,
im coming to take you. i brushed it off not even two minutes after leaving the
bar, a semi blew a red light tboning me sending me in the air and back behind
him. we nearly died, if i havent taken this spirit seriously in the past i will
now, because i know she means business. i am sory this is so long, i have so
much more to say, but fear i<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>fear will<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I
moved into a house in Akron Ohio's University of Akron. This house was very old
and had not been inhabited for many years. Which surprised my roommates and I
because of the great location and cheap rent. The first experinces with the
ghost was the television turning on and off, and channels turning. This would
occur even with the television unplugged. After that, all of us would hear the
bathroom door slam, and would hear it being banged on when we were inside. As
curious college students, we decided to use the ouija board. This was a big
mistake. The ouija board had said that we had 3 spirits in our house. A family
that had occupied the house during WWII and the mass of rubber production at
the Goodyear and Firestone plants. The spirits began getting very active after
this experience. We would hear footsteps running up and down the stairs and
then hear knocks on our bedroom doors. This would become very disturbing at
times.Pennies would fall down the stairs. Everyone that lived in the house during
the time I lived there all had several interactions with this spirit. My
roommates as well as me had felt something crawl into bed with us, and nothing
be there. The ghost was especially active to males. My brother had several
experinces with the spirits slamming his bedroom door, touching him during that
night, and things being moved in his bedroom. A male neighbor was sitting in
the livingroom one night, and saw a large blast of light come from the kitc n.
He would never return to the house. The final night I stayed in that house was
terrifying. The footsteps in the hallway and on the stairs were deafening in
sound. The pounds on the doors seemed like they would knock the doors down.
After my roommates and I vacated the premises, the house has not been occupied
since. That was 2001.I now <o:p></o:p></span></p>

mother told me this, when i was about two years old i was playing outside on my
treehouse, it is about 6 ft. high. She said she couldn't hear me. She ran
outside to see what was wrong. She saw me on the ground and asked if i fell. I
nodded yes and pointed to the top of the treehouse. She couldn't find a scratch
or bruse on me. THen at the age of three, my father came in my room and saw me
talking to someone that wasn't there. He saw an impression of someone on the
bed next to me even though i was by my self. then the impression rasied like
someone got up, i then said &quot;you scared away my friend.&quot; Then about
four years ago, my mother was speeding down a slick road with me in the car. It
started to swerve and i was holding on to the<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>arm rest. I felt like someone was pushing my hand down tightly to the
arm rest. After we stopped she told me that the wheel started to turn by itself
while that happened. Acouple of weeks ago, the front door to our house started
to shake like someone or something was trying to get in. i looked outside and
saw nothing, the about five minutes after, it started again. It happened all
night long until my mother sprinkeled holy water that we had on the door. So
far nothing else has happened.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>In
the new Hazard Kentucky, Appalachian Hospital on the fourth floor, room 420
many strange things have happened. I had been told before I ever saw that room
that it was haunted. It is a room where they place terminally ill patients in
because it is so big the families can stay with them. My father in law was the
first person that I knew of being in there. I did not stay at night with him,
but his children did. They said for no reason at all they would feel as if a
cold wind blew past them. My own personal experience is even bigger. The nurses
provided a cot for us to sleep on when my mother had cancer. When we laid down
to sleep the pillow case kept coming off the pillow, then the pillow would be
pulled into the floor. Several times I put the pillow case back on, but it did
not stay. The last time I picked it up I tied the pillow case on, and it was
still taken off and pulled into the floor. Several times while my family was in
that room, it would feel as if someone or something would pass by you and there
was noone there. The biggest thing that happened was it came a big storm
one<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>night while we were there. It was
raining really hard, but not hard enough to blow a window out. And that is
exactly what happened. In just a matter of seconds the floor was
completely<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>covered in water. Even the
staff that work there say they never want to be put in that room. Now that is
spooky.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
