</H3><P>
<P><B>Hi, I love your site! The amount of content here is amazing, I will
be weeks in reading through</B>
<P><B>it all, I'm sure. I have a story of a minor occurence, but still strange
and unexplained. It was</B>
<P><B>told to me by my mother over the phone this past week (while she was
still at the house in </B>
<P><B>question) and is verified by my father and grandmother. </B>
<P>
<P><B>It happened less than one week ago, around the 27th of July, 1999.
My elderly great uncle Frank </B>
<P><B>owns a large parcel of mountain land and a ranch house in Colorado.
Nobody has lived there for </B>
<P><B>about 6 months, since Frank now needs to be taken care of by my grandmother
who lives in another</B>
<P><B>state. This summer however, my mother, father, and grandmother accompanied
him back up to his </B>
<P><B>empty place. They stayed there with him for about 3 weeks to attend
to his legal affairs, do </B>
<P><B>some maintenence, cleanup, and make sure that nothing was missing from
the house. The place </B>
<P><B>looked every bit the typical "haunted house" from the dust, cobwebs
and the rats all over the </B>
<P><B>place. After a few days, the house was fairly well put back into order.
I don't know the age or</B>
<P><B>history of the house, but it is supposedly fairly old. The surrounding
land is used for grazing</B>
<P><B>and hunting</B>
<P>
<P><B>One night, Frank got up to use the bathroom in the middle of the night.
Being of a thrifty nature</B>
<P><B>, he would use a flashlight to guide the way, rather than turn on the
lightswitch. He kept the </B>
<P><B>flashlight on the headboard behind him. Soon, he woke up my grandmother
in the next room and said</B>
<P><B> something like, "What am I going to do with this flashlight? It's
too hot." She didn't think </B>
<P><B>much of it at first, since Frank is quite old and of declining rationality.
He was simply not </B>
<P><B>making sense. But when he persisted, she took a look at the flashlight.
It was extremely hot to </B>
<P><B>the touch, almost too hot to hold. It was a cheap plastic flashlight,
one that probably should </B>
<P><B>have been warped or somewhat melted from the heat, but it was not.
It was not even turned on. </B>
<P><B>She thought it might have been near a heater, but it hadn't been, since
there was no heater duct</B>
<P><B> or radiator in that room, and besides it was summer, and no heating
had been used. She couldn't</B>
<P><B> find any sort of heat source nearby. So she woke up my parents, and
they also found the </B>
<P><B>flashlight strangely hot.. My father (the engineer) opened it up and
took out the batteries. Sure</B>
<P><B> enough, the batteries were causing the heat, they were burning hot.
They set the batteries on a</B>
<P><B> countertop, and in the morning they were still quite warm. Somehow
these batteries were </B>
<P><B>generating heat on an open circuit (which should be impossible) and
expending more energy than </B>
<P><B>they should have had the "juice" for. This seems not inconsistent with
ghostly phenomena, which </B>
<P><B>I've heard can involve electric, magnetic, or heat energies.</B>

<P><B>The Ghost</B>
<P>
<P><B>By:  scotts_love@webtv.net</B>
<P><B>       It all started happening when we were starting to get</B>
<P><B>everything together.We were putting up the drapes,We would get like</B>
<P><B>three up and they would start falling one by one ! We really didn't</B>
<P><B>think anything of it ! One day our two dogs were in the kitchen,while</B>
<P><B>Cassy was washing dishes.She said that our littlest dog would bark
at</B>
<P><B>this one corner by the fridge.And than when he started braking the</B>
<P><B>fridge started to shake !!!! We keep bottle of water on top of our</B>
<P><B>fridge and one bottle of water fall on the floor !!!! She swears that</B>
<P><B>when she went to go wipe it up that she felt so cold when she went
in</B>
<P><B>the corner.</B>
<P>
<P><B>          Our little sister was staying the night.And we left for a</B>
<P><B>little bit to get some pizza.She said she was going to clean up a
little</B>
<P><B>bit cause she likes playing house.She was there with her friend so
we</B>
<P><B>didn't worry about her being alone.We told them that we keep all of
our</B>
<P><B>cleaning supplies in the garage.So she went into the garage to get
a</B>
<P><B>broom.And she saw a woman with long black hair and pale skin.We found</B>
<P><B>both of the girls at the corner of our street crying ! </B>
<P>
<P><B>       We were both at work one day,and we were getting something
fixed</B>
<P><B>in our house.We told the guy that our door was unlocked and just to
go</B>
<P><B>on in ! We called him later and asked why he never showed!! He said
that</B>
<P><B>he did but the door was locked!! So he knocked on the door and he
heard</B>
<P><B>foot steps so he thought someone was coming!! He waited for a while
and</B>
<P><B>kept knocking but he also kept haring footsteps!! So he looked
through</B>
<P><B>our window and he said that a woman with long black hair was standing</B>
<P><B>there looking at him with a blank face!!!</B>
<P>
<P><B>      Ok, one day I was coming home after work and i saw that the
light</B>
<P><B>in the garage was o!! I was real mad because I thought that Cassy was</B>
<P><B>doing it!! So I called her at her boyfriends house and she said that
she</B>
<P><B>didn't even come home today!! That kept happening alot after that!!!</B>
<P><B>Then ne time I came home for lunch and I was trying to turn on the
TV</B>
<P><B>but it kept turning off on me!! So I went up to the TV to see if any</B>
<P><B>wires were loose!! When I got Close it Started getting really loud!!
I</B>
<P><B>backed up and sat on the couch as the sound started getting louder!!
I</B>
<P><B>covered my ears and started to scream as loud as I could!!! It went
on</B>
<P><B>for about three minutes!! So in the middle of all my screaming it
just</B>
<P><B>turned silent!!! I just got up and decide to go to work so that when
I</B>
<P><B>get home cassy would be there and we both wouldn't have to be alone!!</B>
<P>
<P><B>  Late at night i was not feeling well so decided to take a hot</B>
<P><B>bath..When i finally got in and started to feel better.The water
turned</B>
<P><B>off by its self !!!! I thought i was just imagining things ! So i
just</B>
<P><B>turned the water back on ! I felt something by my head and i was to</B>
<P><B>scared to move ! Than the light went off.. I started to cry and
screamed</B>
<P><B>for Cassy !!!!!! She ran in there tried to turn on the lights and
they</B>
<P><B>wouldn't so she grabed a towel and pulled me up..We called Cassy's</B>
<P><B>boyfriend and he came and got us !</B>
<P>
<P><B>     Ok, well soon we decided that someone or something was wanting
to</B>
<P><B>tell us something!! So we decided that it wanted us out and was going
to</B>
<P><B>do what ever it could to do so!! We talked to the lady who sold us
the</B>
<P><B>house and she just got quiet!! She said that she didn't know any
thing</B>
<P><B>about a woman and that we were just two kids trying to make
trouble!!!</B>
<P><B>but we got out of there and thats our story!!</B>

<P><B>Uncle Rick</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: SMBrown999@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>Rick was my favorite Uncle.  I was really close to him.  Sometimes
he seemed </B>
<P><B>more of like the older brother I never had.  My sisters and I loved
him so </B>
<P><B>much.  He died of cancer 2 months ago. </B>
<P><B>We had been expecting it for awhile, but not as soon as it came.  Anyway,
we </B>
<P><B>all knew we'd have to deal with it one day.  The first week after Uncle
</B>
<P><B>Rick's death I could not sleep.  It seemed as if I was the only one
out of</B>
<P><B>my 3 other sisters and my parents that was deeply affected.  I guess
because </B>
<P><B>Rick only got close to me.  He called me his "Angel."</B>
<P><B>One of these nights when I was tossing and turning I could not get
Rick out </B>
<P><B>of my mind.  The things he used to say would run through my head, as
if he </B>
<P><B>was there talking to me.  His strong scent of cigars mixed w/aftershave
</B>
<P><B>filled the room.  I really believed his spirit was there with me, in
my</B>
<P><B>room. </B>
<P><B> I sat up and opened my eyes.  There he was, sitting at the foot of
my bed, </B>
<P><B>smiling.  No, he did not come on as a "clear, misty image."  He looked
clear </B>
<P><B>as day and you and I.  He waved, them seconds later, left without a
trace.</B>
<P><B> I could still smell his scent.</B>
<P><B>A few days later, the funeral was held.  I did not want to go.  I had
never </B>
<P><B>been to a funeral before.  But I went.  I had to go.  My sisters and
I were </B>
<P><B>talking in the church, while all the adults went to the burial.  It
had </B>
<P><B>started to rain, and the wind was getting severe.  In one of the pews,
there </B>
<P><B>was one man, sitting with his head in his hands.  My sister, Emily
called </B>
<P><B>"Sir? Are you going to the burial?"  He sat up and faced us.  It was
Uncle </B>
<P><B>Rick.  We grabbed each other in shock.  A crash of thunder echoed
through</B>
<P><B>the church, and that was when the lights flickered and before we knew
it, the</B>
<P><B>man was gone.  But we knew it was Rick.  </B>
<P><B>After that day I never had trouble sleeping again.  I will always
miss</B>
<P><B>Rick. My sisters and I never mentioned to anyone what we saw in the
church.  </B>
<P><B>Sometimes I can still smell his aroma and know he is there with me.</B>

<P><B> 2 People's True Stories.....</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>By:  willmc@home.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>Hello.This is willmc's story  from about 96-98.....</B>
<P><B>I was downstairs in my basement one night around 8:00 PM digging
through</B>
<P><B>some old stuff when all of a sudden white orb about 8 inches tall
flew</B>
<P><B>through the small room.The light bulb was dead at the time so there
was</B>
<P><B>very little light.Anyways the orb flew in front of my face and across</B>
<P><B>the room then suddenly dissapeared.Naturally I ran upstairs in a big</B>
<P><B>panic.i didn't go down in my basement for about a week after that.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Next sometime in early 1998 I was up in my living room sitting around
a</B>
<P><B>little coffe table with my friend Evan B. between the loveseat and
my</B>
<P><B>couch, sketching pictures.Then the same white orb flew across the
table</B>
<P><B>then vanished.I stared in bisbelief at Evan and asked "Did you see</B>
<P><B>that".He said "uhh, yeah!" I asked him to describe it and he got it
down</B>
<P><B>to every detail.This time I was less frightened but still a bit</B>
<P><B>scared.After that we moved out the living room and started drawing
in</B>
<P><B>the kitchen.</B>
<P><B>From this day on I still get chills down in the basement and can just</B>
<P><B>sense something moving around.Haven't seen it again yet.I believe it
was</B>
<P><B>the spirit of my Grandmother who passed away in August 1994.</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>the year is From( 96-99)</B>
<P><B>This is my friend Leprachuan's true story.Here it is..... I went to
my</B>
<P><B>uncles house for chrstmas and the night after X-mas i woke in the</B>
<P><B>basement About 6:59,30 seconds and i looked over and saw what I can
best</B>
<P><B>desrcibe as an Orc it was 4 foot tall and it's head was about 2 feet</B>
<P><B>wide and looked at me I paniced and then it ran away towards the room</B>
<P><B>were he heater was and out in the snow and disapeared and the weird</B>
<P><B>thing my aunt had to leave at 7:00 and the time i Yelled it was

<P><B> Touch of the Unknown</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: Omally37@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>           All of my life I have felt the touch of the unknown.  My
Mother </B>
<P><B>died when I was two and a day or so after she passed away my sister
who was </B>
<P><B>16 at the time, went in to cover me and check on me.  To her suprise
the </B>
<P><B>covers on my bed were hovering over me I was asleep but I had my arms
</B>
<P><B>reaching out.  </B>
<P><B>         All my life I felt that there was something watching me, but
the </B>
<P><B>worst experience I had was a duplex I lived in.  I was married and
had my </B>
<P><B>son, a son from a previous marriage and a stepson with us.  From the
time I </B>
<P><B>moved in I had a really bad feeling about the hall closet.  The hall
way was </B>
<P><B>long and it had a very deep closet, they turned the closet in my room
into a </B>
<P><B>bath so mine and my husbands stuff went in there.  I never stayed in
that </B>
<P><B>hall for very long. My husband thought I was a little goofy, he knew
I seen </B>
<P><B>and heard thing before and he just laughed.  One day I was in the kitchen
</B>
<P><B>which the one wall was the kids room.  I felt a strangeness someone
watching </B>
<P><B>again, I turned and then I heard a noise, a tapping coming from the
kids </B>
<P><B>bedroom wall, I checked and the kids were playing, the tapping went
on for a </B>
<P><B>while and finally one of my sons heard it.  That was the beginning,
from </B>
<P><B>there I was in the kitchen on night and the feelings came again, this
time I </B>
<P><B>did not turn but let it come close, when I did out of pure fright there
she </B>
<P><B>stood The Lady In Gray. She vanished in a flash. But I swear this ghost
</B>
<P><B>stayed there, she was dressed in gray, long dress, bonnet and gloves.
 I </B>
<P><B>didn't really fear her, what I feared was who what was in the hall.</B>
<P><B>One night the kids and I were home alone, I should mention that a friend
had </B>
<P><B>come to live me for a while at this time., she had experienced the
knob on </B>
<P><B>the bathroom door turning, anyway we were sitting around my stepson
was</B>
<P><B>doing homework when out of nowhere my glass candles flew off the wall
and smashed </B>
<P><B>to pieces------ Oh I forgot----- we had a thick old fashioned shag
carpet on </B>
<P><B>the floor, the way this glass broke was impossible.  My poor stepson
freaked </B>
<P><B>out, he turned and saw it fly and I mean fly off the wall.  Well, things
</B>
<P><B>really started then.  One day I was by my self at home, I was writing
a </B>
<P><B>letter lying across my bed, I felt her before I saw her, The Lady in
Gray, I </B>
<P><B>looked up and she   was standing in the hall, I never feared her, but
this </B>
<P><B>time I knew she was telling me to get out, I stood up and the room
turned to </B>
<P><B>ice and I ran through  and I mean through her, when I passed the </B>
<P><B>closet I almost threw up I was so scared, when made it to the living
room, I </B>
<P><B>saw the phone cord swinging back and forth and we had beads hanging
in the </B>
<P><B>kitchen window, the too where moving and the drapes in the living room
where </B>
<P><B>moving, and what ever was chasing me was almost on top of me, the room
was </B>
<P><B>freezing and I ran out the door.  I banged on my neighbors door, she
started </B>
<P><B>screaming, I pushed opened the door and I swear on my Mothers grave,
all the </B>
<P><B>cabinets in her kitchen were opening and closing and her living room
was an </B>
<P><B>ice cube.  We both ran out to the front lawn.  She told me that stuff
was </B>
<P><B>happening all day, she would light a cigarette and it would go out,
her</B>
<P><B>drink was on the floor and other things. After a while I decided this
was not</B>
<P><B>going to continue.  We went in my side of the duplex and when I opened
the door</B>
<P><B>All I felt was a blast of cold air and everything was moving as before,
I don't </B>
<P><B>know why but I ran to the kitchen and tried to get my candles out of
the </B>
<P><B>cabinet, they were white, I found out later white is the color of peace,
I </B>
<P><B>had to sit on the floor and tug on the door that thing would not let
me open </B>
<P><B>it.  At that theme my neighbor was screaming and when I turned to tell
her</B>
<P><B>to shut up The Lady in Gray was standing at the doorway, I will only
tell you </B>
<P><B>this, I wet my pants. The doors released and I got the candles out.
I tried </B>
<P><B>to light them. It took me a few times but I managed.  when I lit the
candles </B>
<P><B>I asked God to help-----outloud------the room got still and the cold
left. </B>
<P><B>Few days later I went to landlord and demanded to know what went on
in this </B>
<P><B>house, she told me I was crazy and slammed the door. I never did find
out</B>
<P><B>and we moved a month later.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I have had other experiences also after my husband died but that's
another </B>
<P><B>story.</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>Bachelors Grove</B>
<P>
<P><B>BY;  Sianablue@aol.com</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B>I first heard of Bachelors Grove, in Midlothian, Illinios, through
some </B>
<P><B>friends, many years ago.   I heard all sorts of stories about this
cemetary, </B>
<P><B>ranging from floating orbs and floating houses, to a witches cult that
</B>
<P><B>practiced there. Being open minded to  the experience, I soon checked
it out </B>
<P><B>for myself.  The first time, i had gone with two friends, late at night.
 </B>
<P><B>While nothing out of the ordinary happened, I did feel unusually scared,
I </B>
<P><B>felt there was pure evil in that place, and vowed never to go back.
 I guess </B>
<P><B>you can say, I still remained curious, as I went back several times
after </B>
<P><B>that.  However, it was the last time, I actually SAW something.</B>
<P><B>The last time I went to Bachelors Grove, I went with two other friends,
it </B>
<P><B>was spring time, a really nice day, and it was still light out.  There
is a </B>
<P><B>path in a forest you have to walk down before you actually get to the
</B>
<P><B>cemetary.  We did not make it that far.  Half way along the path, I
was </B>
<P><B>looking straight in front of me, when I noticed something  whiteish
and </B>
<P><B>blurry.  I stopped in my tracks and just kept staring at the same
spot.</B>
<P><B>This ghost that was blurry, slowly seemed as if he was coming into
focus.  It was </B>
<P><B>a man, he had an intense look on his face, his brows were tight, as
if he</B>
<P><B>was concerned or thinking hard, he had a hat on, a coat, a shirt, but
it all </B>
<P><B>appeared somewhat old fashioned, as like something out of the 1920's
or </B>
<P><B>1930's.  I could see the top of his legs, but they kind of
disappeared,</B>
<P><B>right above his knees.  He did'nt move, he did'nt say anything, he
just stood </B>
<P><B>there, looking at me very sternly.  I have to admit, considering this
was</B>
<P><B>the first ghost I ever saw, I was very scared.  I pointed in the direction
where </B>
<P><B>I saw this ghost, I asked my friends if they saw it, they said no.
 I can't </B>
<P><B>explain why I saw it, and they did'nt.  All I can tell you, is I know
what I </B>
<P><B>saw, and I saw a ghost.  </B>
<P><B>Even though my friends did'nt see the ghost, I asked one of my friends
to </B>
<P><B>take a picture in the area where I saw the ghost.  She took two pictures
and </B>
<P><B>we left.</B>
<P><B>When we got the film back, we noticed something strange.  The two pictures
</B>
<P><B>from Bachelors Grove were'nt there.  We looked through the negatives
and </B>
<P><B>noticed that the two pictures we took, were completly white, which
means the </B>
<P><B>pictures we took in that forest path, came out pitch black, and that's
why </B>
<P><B>the photo developer did'nt print them.  Also, every other picture on
that </B>
<P><B>role, the ones before those two pictures, and the ones after, were
perfectly </B>
<P><B>fine, and no abnormailites what so ever.  My friend and I did speak
with the </B>
<P><B>photo developer, and asked him for any reasons why those two pictures
came </B>
<P><B>out black, but we did'nt tell him WHY we wanted to know.  Every possible
</B>
<P><B>explination he came up with, was ruled out for one reason or another.
 </B>
<P><B>I truely believe those pictures came out black because of the ghost.
 Even </B>
<P><B>though the ghost did'nt say or do anything to me, I strongly sensed
he</B>
<P><B>did'nt want me or my friends there, and obviously, he did'nt want to
be </B>
<P><B>photographed either.Since that time, I have not been back.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Guardian Friend</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: dariah69@hotmail.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>I have always desired an encounter with the spirit realm. I guess the
old </B>
<P><B>saying is true: be careful what you wish for... I didn't expect what
I got.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I had been going threw some hard times this past year, a sophmore in
a small </B>
<P><B>town high-school, pluse not being exactly christain wounldn't help.
I had </B>
<P><B>gone threw some tough depression. I came home from the doctor on a
fair </B>
<P><B>Monday afternoon, in another fit of depression. They come and go. I
was </B>
<P><B>reclining on my bed, doing my homework when I herd something skitter
across </B>
<P><B>my floor, it kind of skweeked like a mouse. Leaning forward to see
what the </B>
<P><B>noise was about, I saw a brief flash of gray before my eyes, and the
most </B>
<P><B>pleasant sensation came over me. I was not afraid. I was awed. I told
my </B>
<P><B>friends, especially Naudia, who has a guardian from her past life named
</B>
<P><B>Jonas, and is into paganism just as much as I.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I began to feel foriegn energies in my room, not unpleasant though.
A day or </B>
<P><B>two later, I was on my way to school, and I started staring at a few
crows, </B>
<P><B>whom were cawing as they usually do. I felt as if I were in a trance,
then </B>
<P><B>again it was seven in the morning. All of a sudden I said aloud "Kale".
</B>
<P><B>Bewildered at why I'd say such things, I proceeded to walk to school,
and </B>
<P><B>told my friends of the new happenings.</B>
<P>
<P><B>That Saturday, Naudia and I noticed that the energies were coming 
from just </B>
<P><B>above my alter. We also noticed that a picture I had hung up on my
wall of </B>
<P><B>her, would, when ever we where totally ignoring the warmth of the spirit
</B>
<P><B>intity, would move a few inches one way, and then another. Later we
shut the </B>
<P><B>door, lit soom candles at my alter, filled up to the brim mind you,
my </B>
<P><B>gargoyle water fountain, and plugged it in. We sat on my bed, and proceeded
</B>
<P><B>to shuffle my tarot deck, in preparation for a reading or two. Talking
about </B>
<P><B>this and that, we began to notice that the fountain began to stop and
start </B>
<P><B>on its' own accourd. I asked if it was indeed the spirit that had
manifested </B>
<P><B>itself in my room. The fountain stopped for a time and started again.
We </B>
<P><B>asked that it would reply to our yes or no questions that we asked
of it, in </B>
<P><B>a manner just like that, the fountain stopped briefly, and it stopped
and </B>
<P><B>started again. Exicitedly, I asked curiously if his name might be 'Kale'.
He </B>
<P><B>answered yes. Asking next if I knew him in a past life, he answered
yes. </B>
<P><B>Then I asked if he'd known Naudia and Jonas, yes again. Since he was
moving </B>
<P><B>Naudia's picture around, I asked if he did he liked her, he said yes,
that </B>
<P><B>he didn't like her. After that the fountain stopped. Nothing
happened.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Kale did not return for about a month, until one day, in a fit of boredom,
I </B>
<P><B>painted my ceiling with blue and white mixed so it looked like a cloudy
sky, </B>
<P><B>and moved my room around. That night, or shortly there after, I saw
lights </B>
<P><B>moving around in my dark room, as I was laying on my back waiting to
fall to </B>
<P><B>sleep. Amazed by the beautiful colors swirling around my room, I watched
for </B>
<P><B>a while, until they began to make a form at the foot of my bed. Closing
my </B>
<P><B>eyes, I rolled over so I would go to sleep, and not see whatever it
was, </B>
<P><B>because I began getting bad vibes. After laying there for a bit, I
started </B>
<P><B>feeling things poke me; on my back, sides and legs. Not harsh pokes,
but, </B>
<P><B>'hey I'm here' pokes. I fell to sleep shortly there after. In the few
weeks </B>
<P><B>since, I have only seen the colors, and ever now and then his
presense.</B>
<P>
<P><B>That is all. so far.</B>
<P>
<P><B>And there yah have it. I have never really submitted anything, but
I will be </B>
<P><B>curious of what you (the reader) thinks of my tale.  </B>
<P>
<P><B> Concerns...</B>
<P>
<P><B>By:  MML5419@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B> I believe I've been having some sort of ghost 'friend' visit me almost
every night for </B>
<P><B>the past 7-8 years. </B>
<P><B>Anyway, let me tell you what has been going on.  Back in 1989, my
husband</B>
<P><B>and </B>
<P><B>I relocated to upstate NY from MA.  During this time I found out I
was </B>
<P><B>pregnant and we were also commuting back in forth between states each
</B>
<P><B>week-end for about 4 months.  The reason for this was because, we
were</B>
<P><B>trying </B>
<P><B>to sell our house in MA and we were living at a motel in NY until the
house </B>
<P><B>was finally sold in December.  But because of this commuting we had
to leave </B>
<P><B>our cats behind in MA with friends.  Anyway, we finally moved in the
day </B>
<P><B>before christmas. </B>
<P>
<P><B>A few years later:  One night while I was laying in bed asleep on my
side, I </B>
<P><B>felt motion on our waterbed and assumed my husband was coming to bed.
 As I </B>
<P><B>rolled over, I noticed he wasn't even in the room.  Again I tried to
go back </B>
<P><B>to sleep, and I felt motion again like my husband was getting into
bed (so i </B>
<P><B>thought). I rolled over and my husband wasn't even in the room again.
 I </B>
<P><B>finally fell asleep and never said anything about it.</B>
<P><B>But then I kept having the same type of feelings, but it felt more
like </B>
<P><B>something was walking on the bed (such as a cat).  I had a pillow near
my </B>
<P><B>feet so I could rest my feet on it at night and have them elevated
(due to </B>
<P><B>circulation problem with legs).  And I finally realized that 'it' would
</B>
<P><B>startle me when I felt 'it' land on the bed by my feet.  I could feel
the </B>
<P><B>kneading motion that cats do on my pillow by my feet.  Of course, by
now I I </B>
<P><B>was starting to get anxious and panicky about all these feeling go
on. These </B>
<P><B>continued on almost every night, sometimes I would feel the pressure
of 'it' </B>
<P><B>walking up along side of me and get on my pillow by my head.  But if
I moved </B>
<P><B>my head to try to get 'it' off my pillow 'it' would walk back down
to my </B>
<P><B>other pillow by my feet.  Sometimes 'it' would walk along side my
back,</B>
<P><B>other </B>
<P><B>times along my front.  Sometimes I would feel pressure on my lower
backside </B>
<P><B>as thought it just laid down next to me, and I could feel some movement
</B>
<P><B>after. One thing I did notice was, that when 'it' walked over my arms
or </B>
<P><B>body, my arms/body would feel a sensation of numbness/tingling and
heavy </B>
<P><B>almost hurt a bit, but the sensation was gone as soon as 'it' passed.
 I </B>
<P><B>usually can tell where 'it' is on the bed from the walking movements.
</B>
<P>
<P><B>We moved again 3 years ago and the same thing is still occuring till
this </B>
<P><B>day.  By the way, my husband can't feel or see anything. Some nights
it's </B>
<P><B>very difficult to get to sleep right away due to this 'it'.  I can't
see </B>
<P><B>anything, just feel the 'feet' walking on the bed. I'm assuming 'it'
is a </B>
<P><B>cat, althought we never let our cats on our waterbed.</B>

<P>
<P><B>This was not an experience of mine but a friend of mine. On Sunday
August</B>
<P><B>1st we saw The Blair Witch Project. On the way home we started talking
of</B>
<P><B>ghosts and haunted places we had heard of.  "Christine" my friend
 then</B>
<P><B>told  a story to me she had told no one but her family. I'll try and
tell</B>
<P><B>it exactly like she did.  It was just this past November of 1998. She</B>
<P><B>always went to bed with her closet doors closed. One night she awoke
syaing</B>
<P><B>she felt a strange presence in her room.  She turned her head toward
her</B>
<P><B>closet and could see the silhouette of a person standing in front of
her</B>
<P><B>now open closet doors. She said she tried to scream out for her sister,
but</B>
<P><B>it came out as a mere whisper. She said she felt like she had been
heavily</B>
<P><B>sedated. She couldn't talk, move , or even keep her eyes open. She
closed</B>
<P><B>them but reopened them in what she said felt like a normal blink. She
then</B>
<P><B>saw the silhouette standing at  the edge of her bed. She owns two dogs,
one</B>
<P><B>of which sleeps in a cage at night, but she said she saw them at her
door</B>
<P><B>barking at the figure. She blinked again and this time when she opened
her</B>
<P><B>eyes she could no longer she the silhouette, but could feel a weight
upon</B>
<P><B>her, and she could see the form of a person in the impresion on her
bed. </B>
<P><B>She closed her eyes again and awoke to daylight. She also said there
was a</B>
<P><B>strong, overpowering smell of flowers like she had walked into a
florist</B>
<P><B>shop. This same thing happened three nights in a row but has not
happened</B>
<P><B>since. Nor has anything else out of the ordinary happened. Her family</B>
<P><B>thinks it was just a strange reoccurring dream. </B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B> Experiences I have had over the Years</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: AERODYNECA@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B> I've been looking for an area like this.  My family is originally
</B>
<P><B>from Scotland and settled in the San Francisco Bay area in the 1920's,
so we </B>
<P><B>were recent as far as our immigration.  Our family has always had a
tough of </B>
<P><B>Scottish fey-ness about them and I was not excluded.  </B>
<P><B>My first experience happened when I was 6 years old.  My
grandparents,</B>
<P><B>whom I lived with, had taken me with them to Olivet Cemetary in Colma,
CA to help </B>
<P><B>tidy up some of the family burial sites.  One of the sites was where
two of </B>
<P><B>the grandmother's still born children were buried back in the 1940's.
 It is </B>
<P><B>on the northwest side of the cemetary and was at that time surrounded
by </B>
<P><B>hedgerows.  To the south of the area were several boardering cypress
and </B>
<P><B>cedar trees that were very large and overgrown.  In the corner of the
</B>
<P><B>hedgerow/tree boarder was an old green metal framwork for an awning
.  The </B>
<P><B>fabric was long gone and the framework was rusty.  I had gove over
to it to </B>
<P><B>explore.  </B>
<P><B>When I got close to it I noticed that there was a lady sitting on the
</B>
<P><B>railing.  She was crying.  She had a large brimmed hat, ankle long
black </B>
<P><B>dress and gloves and was carrying a draw string black purse.  She asked
if I </B>
<P><B>would come over and talk to her for awhile.  Being told not to talk
to </B>
<P><B>strangers, I told her that I would have to ask my grnadmother first.
 </B>
<P><B>When I went to Grandma and asked she looked in the direction of the
lady and </B>
<P><B>told me to stay put.  Later, as we drove out of the cemetary I pointed
to</B>
<P><B>one of the mausoleums and told my grandparents that there was the
lady's</B>
<P><B>house. Grandma asked how I knew that.  I told her that I could see
her purse</B>
<P><B>sitting up in the window on the ledge inside.</B>
<P><B>Grandma and I talked this over several times over the years.  She had
never </B>
<P><B>seen whom it was I had been speaking to and didn't see her when I pointed
to </B>
<P><B>her.  It was apparently a ghost.  </B>
<P><B>I went back to Olivet as recently was last year with my husband and
son to </B>
<P><B>see if maybe I could take a photo of the spot and catch her on film
but I</B>
<P><B>was unsuccessful.  I would love to find out who she is.</B>
<P><B>I have had other experiences both here in Fresno and in Sunnyvale,
 </B>
<P><B>Provo,Utah and in Todalen, Norway.  They have been difficult to talk
about.  </B>
<P><B>If you are interested I can share those with you as well as some things
I </B>
<P><B>have been trying to investigate on my own here in Fresno at the </B>
<P><B>Belmont/Calvary/Mountain View Cemetaries (there sort of combined).
 Maybe </B>
<P><B>someone out there can help to explain some of what I have expereinced
or at </B>
<P><B>least tell me some history of the areas.  I guess I have been very
</B>
<P><B>psychically open all of my life.  Sometimes it's been a bit of a </B>
<P><B>curse..seeing things no one else does or hearing and knowing things.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Thanks for listening.</B>
