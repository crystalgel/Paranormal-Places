Also Had Ghostly experience at the Duarte Old Spagetti Factory<br>
<br>
By: trixieeee@aol.com<br>
&nbsp;<br>
9 years ago my husband, another couple and myself were seated at a
table near the kitchen. When the waiter brought our drinks to the
table, the tray beneath the drinks very forcefully flipped sideways and
the drinks fell all over the table. The waiter was dumb founded and
said we must have flipped the tray but none of our hands were anywhere
near the tray. I had&nbsp; a perfect view of the tray and can vouch
that it flipped all on its own. We told the waiter that we thought the
restaurant was haunted, he said he was new there and did not know. When
he returned from the kitchen, he confirmed that he was told that it was
haunted.&nbsp; <br>

Haunted Spot in Salem Oregon<br>
<br>
By: simluvr@gmail.com<br>
<br>
All right i have gone through your list ad i think you have done a good
job but i have lived in Salem most of my life and there are some you
have missed.<br>
The first one is the Home Town Buffet at 636 Lancaster Dr NE, Salem, OR this is a personal experience.<br>
When i was there with my family I went to use the bathroom. As i was in
the stall I heard someone slam open the door and run in. I peaked out
the door and was a woman in a pure white 50s style dress run by me and
into the last stall. She had pure white skin and pure white clothes as
was her hair. I got out and looked around. All the stall doors were
open and when i looked in them all of them were empty.<br>
&nbsp;I have heard stories around that the original owner killed his
wife and never got convicted for it. That is all i know on that.<br>
Another one is an apartment were i currently live. IThere has been a
lot of unusual happenings and so far i am aware of 3 separate entities.
There is a former owner who was murdered in the apartment i currently
live in. I have been walking home and seen flashes of light in the
windows and have felt cold winds when no windows or doors were open. My
door just randomly slams open and shut. And recently I have been not
able to sleep till midnight or 3 am when things start crashing around
my room. When i look up everything is back in order. Another one is a
boy who lives in a different section of the apartment. He doesnt bother
you but he use to play with my little sister (whos 1) and has talked to
me before. Another one i know who the person was. It was this girl who
was raped, abused, and killed by her parents. This happened about 3
years ago and i had to move into the apartment. I found many toys
randomly in my room that would move around while i was sleeping. The
showers and sink fixtures will randomly turn on to scalding hot. And
once our closet(which had a glass mirror on it) started shaking and
shattered.<br>
That is all i know about but hope i have more to tell you soon,<br>

Glenville Haunting Experience<br>
<br>
By: mommadearest07@yahoo.com <br>
<br>
While I was working in pickens hall one summer I was on the 4th floor
making sure all the&nbsp; dorm doors were locked after the summer clean
up and all the lights were out. I had heard that the elevator would
sometimes go to each floor and open then shut and go to another, And I
had also heard that someone would pear out then go on. But I was never
really a believer until I experienced it myself. I was checking the
last two doors closest the elevator and I heard the elevator ding. It
startled me because I knew that all the other workers were already down
stairs. So I glanced around the corner and the door opened and just as
quickly as it opened it shut again. Then I heard it open again on the
floor above me. Needless to say I took the stair that day.<br>

My Outing<br>
<br>
By: threejackbees@aol.com<br>
<br>
Thanks for the collection of info of the area. I have had numerour
experiences but the one that I remember most was one night I went with
my then boyfriend to his school at night because he had some work to
do. He admitted he was scared to go there on his own at night because
it felt strange so this six foot three man needed the support of a
small 5 foot three woman...anyways, off we went. To get to his room we
had to go through the auditorium, up the stairs through the balcony. I
felt a bit uneasy but with a light heart I stayed and helped him in his
room for a while. I became thirsty and told him I would be right back
that I was going to the teacher's room to get a soda. The room was dark
except for the light of the soda machine. I put the money in and was
facing the door that faced the auditorium. The soda fell with the usual
bang to the bottom and suddenly I heard a mans voice yell GET OUT! from
the auditorium. I quickly but calmly turned around and told my
boyfriend it was time to go. He asked why and I said I would tell him
once we got into the car. As we drove away I told him what happened. He
was freaked out and told me others had seen and heard a man and
childern in the auditorium. The school is no longer in use.<br>

Ohio Experience<br>
<br>
By: kimandlilyv@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
there is a house&nbsp; outside of green camp ohio that is haunted by
the ghost of the evil person who is buried on the property.&nbsp; The
grave is right beside the house (on the right side if you are looking
at the house from the street.&nbsp; The story is that this person was
so evil they put a white fence around his grave and a planted a tree at
all four corners of the grave to keep him in it!&nbsp; <br>
The house has a two toned doorbell when you ring it both tones will go
off, if you slam the door the second tone only will go off.&nbsp; There
are times when if you are sitting in the front room you will hear the
door slam and the tone go off even though you are looking at the door
and nothing happened!&nbsp; ALso if you are sitting in the front room
reading you will feel someone walk past you quickly.&nbsp; My brother
and I used to live there as children/teenagers.&nbsp; I distinctly
remember a few different times when we were in that room on the couch
reading and would both look up startled at the exact same time by the
"ghost" as he walked past us! <br>
The ghost has also been known to knock/tap on the window of the front
bedroom (no trees or bushes near it that could have done the persistent
tapping).<br>
Also anyone walking or playing close to the grave that is on the property will get nauseated and have to back away!<br>
these are all things that have happened to me when i lived there between 1985-1992<br>

One of My First Experiences<br>
<br>
By: breezylovestoread@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
OK, <br>
&nbsp;One of my first experiences with ghost was when I was about 5 or
6. I was in Texas at my grandma's house with my brother, and cousin. We
were sleeping in the living room and I heard kids playing in the
back-ground, then I heard a man call my name. I thought everyone else
was up and my grandpa was waking me up. I stood up and opened my eyes
and there was no-one there. It was also silent. I thought it was a
dream, but then I heard kids again and a man's voice started to call my
name again. I now knew that this wasn't a dream. I ran to my
grandparents room and told them there was a man calling my name and
that there were kids playing. My grandma said I was having a nightmare
and to go to sleep. I got into bed with them and went to sleep. About
an hour later my cousin came into the room saying that a man wouldn't
stop calling his name. My grandma thought maybe it was a coincidence
and told us to go to sleep. Nothing ever happened to my brother. A few
weeks later we got a call from them telling us that they were moving.
My grandpa had gotten up at about 1:00 am to let the dog outside and
when he turned around all of the dog's squaky toys started squeaking
and there was a women standing right in front of him. (and it wasn't my
grandma.) They found a house and started moving as quickly as possible.
We came down to help them (we lived in Oklahoma at the time) and my
grandma told us there was a family that lived in the house and the dad
and kids all died in a house fire! We never found out who the women was
though.<br>
Thank-you for letting me submit my story to you. This is one of my scariest but I have lots of others.<br>

All My Life<br>
<br>
By: nowherextoxhide@aol.com<br>
&nbsp;<br>
For as long as I can remember I've been able to feel and see spirits
that no one else could. It took me many years to discovery what this
ablity was and that I wasn't alone.<br>
I don't remember my first "ghostly" experience very well but my mother
does. She's told me the story many times. I was 3 years old and we were
visiting my grandmother at her home in East Boston. I walked into the
back bedroom (my grnadmother's room) and then back into the dining room
and asked my grandmother about the man in her room. She asked me to
describe him so I did. She turned to my mother and quietly said, 'She
has a gift.' She handed me a photo of her and my deceased grandfather
and asked me if that was the man. I said yes but he was skinnier now.<br>
My grandfather died of a brain aneurysm, a complication from a bout of meningitis in 1952. 34 years before my birth.<br>
One year later when I was 4 we moved into a new home (directly behind
the house was the cemetery). We lived in that house for the next 14
years. <br>
There was a very heavy, eerie feeling that surrounded the stairs.
Something watched you from the base of the stairs while you were in the
living room or at the top of the stairs. Every so often there was
footsteps and the sounds of someone falling down them. When you went to
investigate nothing was there.<br>
The basement was the worst place. It felt like something like a vice
grip was squeezing your chest. I could never go down there. I was
apparently the only one that felt it. My sister told me after she moved
her room down there that she never quite felt alone and she'd get this
odd headache then smell something really awful (my dad made sure
everything was perfectly safe before she moved everything down). There
was no explainable reason for her experiences.<br>
I've had experinces outside the house as well. In cemeteries and other
peoples homes. Recently I began to investigate haunted places in New
England with my friends.<br>
Since moving into my current residence in 2005 I haven't had any experiences at my home.<br>

Crestwood Nursing Home<br>
<br>
By: skyblukat@yahoo.com <br>
<br>
I live within walking distance to an old abandoned nursing home. Before
its closure I would pass it and a great deal of sadness and neglect
would over come me. I know in my heart that place is haunted. After it
closed its doors in January&nbsp; 2008, when I travel pass it, the
feeling has increased. I would like to go inside the nursing home but
until I get permission I am afraid I can't. I went into the parking lot
last night and I saw lots of lights on and a glowing red light in the
smoking room. I got out of the parking lot as quick as I could because
that erie feeling almost made me cry. <br>
I have always had the gift of knowing a place is haunted. My oldest
daughter has the same ability. We can enter a place and KNOW it is
haunted just by our senses. One day I will be able to go inside that
nursing home and hopefully it will help the poor ghosts/spirits have
validity.<br>

This summer (2007) my daughter and I went on the evening<br>
ghost tour which begins in a field about 3 blocks from the<br>
house.&nbsp; Everyone in our party saw a ghost about 50 feet in front
of us.&nbsp; The ghost was about 4 feet tall and started moving toward
us. The ghost remained present for almost<br>
20 minutes. <br>
We then went through the house.&nbsp; On the the teenagers in our group
held her digital cell phone camers around the corner of the
stairwell.&nbsp; A perfect image of a more slender ghost with a very
dark head stood midway on the steps by the railing in the
picture.&nbsp; Once in the basement I<br>
got up from a bench to move to another and was tapped on my left shoulder.&nbsp; I was eager to leave and had the same<br>
shoulder tapped mid way up the exterior cellar steps.&nbsp; No one was near me either time.<br>

In Marysville Washington, Grove Street there is a row of duplexes near
Allen creek. One night i was in one of the duplexes witch was my aunt&#8217;s
house. Everybody was asleep except my aunt and me. My aunt had a large
diamond shaped mirror on the wall and she looked inside the mirror and
we both saw a black figure walking back and forth in her kitchen. That
is not all we saw or heard. We Bothe took a daring risk and went in the
kitchen. When we went in the kitchen my aunts hair was blowing behind
her. We heard a moaning sound; we both thought that we should get out
of the kitchen. The next morning we brought my dog princess over. At
about 3:00 we heard 3 loud bangs! My dog princess went in the room and
started barking at the bedroom. She layed back again and every hour she
went in the room then barked. In the next few minutes we saw an old
lady wearing a white gown and a cane.<br>

Texas &amp; Beyond<br>
<br>
<br>
By: delrashell@gmail.com<br>
<br>
<br>
We lived in a small farmhouse with a huge backyard and beyond the fence
an even larger pasture, I was 11 years old when we lived there and we
(the kids) would always explore the backyard especially at night and
play hide and seek all of the time. One night in this big backyard I
was alone and looking out at the pasture when suddenly I felt as though
I was being watched and I turned my head to look at the house when I
saw a transparent man looking at me and then he disappeared a few
seconds later. My uncle had died when I was 4 so I assumed it was him
watching over me and ventured into the house and went to sleep. A few
months went by with no strange happenings when I went over to a friends
house and spent the night with her. We had a little slumber party and
ended up sleeping in the living room when she woke me up at about 3 in
the morning apparently scared out of her mind and told me she had woken
to go to the bathroom when she felt something that made her hair stand
on end and then saw a shadowy tall figure of a man with a pressed suit
on, no hands or feet, and some kind of burlap bag over his head with a
rope tied twice around his neck so naturally I thought she was kidding
around trying to scare me so I got up and ventured in the direction she
was pointing when I felt this strange sensation and boom-like magic
there he was. I ran back and told her that I too had seen it and she
ran into her parents room and got them out of bed and naturally they
told us there were no such things as ghosts and told us to go back to
sleep. We lay in the living room a long time just watching this thing
pace back &amp; forth and waiting for dawn so we could finally get some
sleep and about 5 in the morning the visitor disappeared and we fell
sound asleep. Never in a million years if someone would have told me
this would be the beginning of a 19 year haunting would I have believed
them but that is exactly what happened-not just to me but to my friend
also. It seems that this ghost visited us every night at the same time
for almost two years at first just pacing the halls then turning things
off and on, changing tv channels and radio stations, swinging things on
the walls; just little annoying things that at our age would scare the
crap out of you. One of the scariest nights I can remember was one at
my house-we were sitting on my bed eating ice cream when we both got
that spooky feeling and fell silent and we smelled something burning
for a second and then we heard the most guttural scary movie growl I
have ever heard in my life to this day, we threw our bowls and ran into
the living room where I felt the need to spill the beans to my parents.
Of course they told me we were crazy and that our imaginations were
great. A few months later I was still insisting to them that something
evil was in the house and they kept telling me the same thing and began
asking me if I need help like counseling or something but I kept
fighting with them about it, by this point even my brothers thought I
was insane. A few months later my parents decided to move because I
stuck to my story and they were hoping that if they got me away from my
friend that my imagination wouldn't work overtime. We moved about 65
miles from that town to another farmhouse that was even older than the
last one. The same thing was happening only instead of pacing back and
forth the figure began to float to my bedside lean its head to the side
and make noises like it wanted something from me. This was a nightly
ordeal for a few months and then it began to start touching me-I could
never see it's hands but I could feel the icy cold prickle sensation
that came with it working it's way up my bed to my legs up my body and
even surrounding my head-most nights I was too afraid to move and
afraid to cry out so I lay in bed silently weeping. This went on for
quite sometime too and then it began to lay in the bed beside me and
touch me off and on all night as though it was testing me to see if I
was scared and trust me I was terrified but when 5 a.m. rolled around &#8211;
poof he would vanish. After a few months of this and a ton of lost
sleep I finally got the nerve up to throw a pillow at him and whisper
yell at him, you know things like what do you want from me and he began
to put his head to the side even more and grunt hummmm hummmm as if he
was replying "what" (remember the figure always had on a pressed pin
striped suit, and some kind of burlap bag over his head with a rope
that showed to be strung around his neck at least 2 times) so I never
saw a face or heard him speak anything other than the hummmm hummmm's
it was doing that night but shortly after my temper tantrum it left.
Finally a few nights of peaceful sleep until I was awakened by heavy
footsteps in the foyer going through the kitchen which was not like him
at all and then the burned smell again and I was so afraid that I would
hear that growl again that I remember thinking my parents will surely
find me dead in the morning from a heart attack. To make a long story
shorter here a list of things that happened &#8211; After that night I never
saw the burlap ghost again but strange things and sounds and figures
would keep me up all night it was like an open portal in my bedroom- I
would wake up scratched up, heavy breathing in my ears, pressure on my
chest, racing black silvery balls across the ceiling, red eyes racing
through my room and disappearing, laughter, waking with my arms bruised
as if someone had grabbed me, something cold that I always assumed to
be a hand because I felt something like a huge ring hit the bottom of
my foot grabbed me by the ankle and almost slung me out of bed, a Bible
was slung across the room and landed on my bed as I had taken to the
habit of filling my room with religious items, and one night so much
activity in my room that my younger brother was awakened and came in
only to turn white and start screaming and to this day he will not tell
me what he saw. So on to the future&#8230;I turned 18 (still struggling with
this haunting or whatever you call it) and joined the military and it
still followed me. Even being stationed in Iceland it was still up to
no good and my best friend who was also my room mate would say things
like something is not right and it was doing all of it's little tricks
again like turning things on and off but she seemed fascinated with it
so I told her the entire story and she didn't seem to mind she just
wondered what I had done to have this happening to me. Finally a few
years of peace without one thing happening. I am now 24 and live with
my boyfriend in our 3 bedroom 2 bath house and nothing another year of
peace when he tells me one morning that he felt like he was being
choked in the middle of the night and he has some bruises on his arm. I
say nothing because I don't want him to think I am crazy but it keeps
happening and then I wake up, look at the clock and it's 3 a.m. again
and something is breathing heavy in my ear! I got up and went into our
guest bedroom and nothing so I fall asleep for what seems like a few
hours but when I wake up it is only 40 past three so I attempt to get
up and I can't move-something is strangling me and hitting me all over,
I struggle to get up but can not move, I can't even scream; this went
on for about 15 or 20 minutes and poof the struggle was over. This time
the attack is so severe I consider calling a team of specialists out to
see what it is but I never did. Shortly after that my boyfriend and I
split up and I moved to Oklahoma to be with my family and nothing has
happened since. Once in a while I get a strange sensation but I don't
think about it twice and just keep doing what I am doing and it has now
been about two years since anything out of the ordinary has happened.
There are many more things that happened during this trying period of
my life but for me to write it on here would take a year at the least.
For those of you whom read this and think I'm crazy I can only say that
maybe someday my little brother will tell me what he saw.<br>

Dark Shadows and Disembodied Voice<br>
<br>
By: renjisan6@gmail.com<br>
<br>
When I was young, my grandmother owned a very old, rustic country
summer home in a small village about 3 hours away from a large city
where I grew up.&nbsp;&nbsp; There was nothing particularly threatening
about the outside of the house.&nbsp; To a casual onlooker,&nbsp; it
just looked like a quaint old house, much like the majority of the
houses in the village.&nbsp; During summer break from school, my
parents would send me there since my grandmother always took her
vacations there, far away from the busy life in the big city where we
all lived.&nbsp;&nbsp; Though I missed my parents a lot and didn't get
along well with my grandmother, I still, for the most part, enjoyed the
large garden with its old apple trees, a berry orchard, and a large
vegetable garden.&nbsp; <br>
The inside of the house had a very different feel to it.&nbsp; First of
all, it was definitely very old and somewhat musty because it went
unused for a large portion of the year.&nbsp;&nbsp; In one of the
bedrooms where the wallpaper was peeling, you could see several layers
of different color wallpaper, which makes me think that the house was
owned by many people before my grandmother, though she had for many,
many years.&nbsp; Though it had a sink, it did not have a toilet or a
shower (instead there was an oddhouse outside and an outside shower for
summer use). <br>
There was one room in the house, which was added sometime after the
original house was built.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a slightly newer, open
space with many windows, painted in a pleasant pastel color.&nbsp; It
was located at the very back of the house.&nbsp;&nbsp; For some reason,
my grandmother insisted that this particular room is where I would
stay.&nbsp; If you were to simply look at it, you would find absolutely
nothing threatening about this room.&nbsp;&nbsp; However,&nbsp; for
some reason, I was terrified of staying there.&nbsp; My parents always
remarked that unlike other children, I was scared of nothing.&nbsp; I
always slept with the lights off, never had any incidents where I was
scared to be alone and never had any childlike fears such as a monster
in the closet, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, my parents found it highly unusual
that being 8 or 9 years old, I was absolutely terrified of this
room.&nbsp;&nbsp; I would beg my grandmother to let me sleep in the
bedroom in the main part of the house, but she always just told me that
I was being silly and there was absolutely nothing wrong with the
room.&nbsp; Yet at night, with the lights off, I couldn't help but hear
unusual creaking sounds, knockings, and what sounded like footsteps
after my grandmother had gone to bed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Having never been
scared of anything, I would pull the blanket almost all the way over
myself, except for my eyes, out of which I could see faint black
shadows moving along the corners of the room.&nbsp; I tried so hard to
convince myself that I was just imagining things but the extreme uneasy
feeling never let up.&nbsp;&nbsp; I felt like something in the room
could physically hurt me if it chose to.<br>
I told my parents and kept asking my grandmother about the room but my
questions were sidestepped, and I was always told that I'm just
imagining things and maybe it's because the room is sort of isolated
from the rest of the house that makes me nervous.&nbsp; And of course,
I got the usual explanation of "it's just the house settling,
etc."&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the house had no hot water, they couldn't blame
the water heater. <br>
Things would go on like this every summer I was there... On a few
occasions when I was allowed to sleep in the bedroom in the main part
of the house, I felt much more at ease and was able to fall asleep much
better. In the other room, the uneasy feeling would keep me awake for
hours--which was highly unusual for me since I never had trouble
sleeping anywhere else.&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet though significantly weaker,
the effects of that negative energy permeated the entire house.&nbsp;
To wash up before bed, we would heat water in the kitchen in put it in
a basin.&nbsp; On numerous ocassions when I was washing my face or
giving myself a sponge bath (since the only shower was outside), I had
very strong feelings of being watched to the point where I would do
what I needed to do as fast as possible and would turn to look behind
me, expecting someone to be there. <br>
One particular occassion, I remember very clearly.&nbsp; It was broad
daylight and my grandmother went to the local market to buy food while
leaving me at the house by myself.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was about to go
outside to the garden, when I heard a loud female voice clearly calling
my name from the living room.&nbsp; Utterly confused since I was
supposed to be the only one in the house, I went to investigate.&nbsp;
My grandmother was still out and I confirmed that I was alone.&nbsp;
Then I heard the same voice again, calling out to me urgently from
another room.&nbsp; I was really freaked out and almost ran out of the
house but made myself go and see if anyone was there.&nbsp; I saw no
one. <br>
When my grandmother got back from the market, I told her what happened
and she told me many people imagine someone calling their name when
they are home by themselves.&nbsp; Even then, I thought it was an odd
explanation since I never had an occurance like that before... And
actually, I haven't had an occurance like that in the nearly 20 years
since then.&nbsp; <br>
Sadly, since I was still a child, I never found out the history of the
house before my grandmother finally sold it after she was too old to
maintain it.&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't envy whoever owns it now though...<br>
<br>

Weird Things after Fiance's Death in our Townhouse<br>
<br>
By: Moonstarwolf004@aol.com<br>
<br>
<br>
My fiance' had just died in our townhouse,this was in 2002. He had shot
himself in the head. I went back later,because I couldn't go back there
for awhile after he died. Anyway I went back and I kept feeling a hand
brush across my forehead. One night I was in bed and was about to fall
asleep when something grabbed my foot and was pulling it downward. I
freaked out! I was the only one in the house! Then I had a friend come
over because I was afraid to be alone because of these things
happening. My friend was downstairs and I was upstairs coming out of
the bathroom and a dark floating figure floated right by me. It almost
ran into me and would have had I not stepped back. It telepathically
told me it was not here for me and that it had gotten what it wanted
and also It would not look @ me directly. I somehow felt like I was
protected by God and the thing was actually afraid of me!&nbsp; I
didn't feel scared. <br>
Later on in the month I took a bunch of pictures of the townhouse
inside,because I wanted to remember the good times where my fiance' had
lived and been very happy together at one time. I was planning on
moving,because the memory of his death was just to much for me and I
always had this creepy feeling there since he had died. After I got the
pictures developed(there were 120 photos in all of several different
rolls of film of different things and then the one that I had taken
pictures of the inside of the townhouse) Out of all of those photos I
had taken 3 of the exact place where he had died. In ONLY those 3
photos were what appeared to be flames right in the place where he had
passed. It almost looked like the portal to HELL,seriously. To this day
I cannot explain those pictures. They were taken with a very expensive
camera. No other photos I had developed before or after that had ever
had those flames in them like that!! Just the 3 that were of the exact
location of his body when he died!<br>

In November 2006 my friend Patty asked if I wanted to go to Jefferson
and stay at the famous Jefferson Hotel.&nbsp; I said yes, then she
tells me we're going on November 19th and we're staying in their most
haunted room, number 19.&nbsp; That scernio seemed creepy in itself!<br>
The Jefferson is as quaint a small town as you'll find.&nbsp; The hotel
was no exception;&nbsp; reminded me of my grandmother's house.&nbsp;
Warm, cozy and creaky.&nbsp; We checked in, put our stuff in our room
and decided to take our cameras and see what we could find while it was
still daylight.&nbsp; We chatted with the owner of the Cypress Coffee
House across the street about his experiences and he let us take
pictures of him and his store.&nbsp; We felt honored because he
normally doesn't let anyone other than the folks on the ghost tour do
that.&nbsp; We took about three pictures and our cameras died - typical
for ghost hunting.&nbsp; <br>
We took our cameras back to the room so they could charge up for the
ghost tour that evening and then we were heading downstairs for
dinner.&nbsp; Before we left Patty wanted to see what kind of activity
she could coax out of the room.&nbsp; I believe a woman is to have
committed suicide in the room.&nbsp; Patty was asking her to make the
chandelier move, write on the mirror, make some noise.&nbsp; While
standing there, we noticed the temperature in the room kept going
up.&nbsp; Curious, I checked the thermostat and the temp had increased
to 6 degrees warmer than what the thermostat was set to.&nbsp; So I
turned off the heat. (each room has it's own climate control).&nbsp;
Even with everything shut down, the temp continued to increase at a
steady pace.&nbsp; At that point we decided it was a good idea to leave
the room and have&nbsp; dinner.<br>
While waiting for our table in the hotel restaurant, we were chatting
with the host.&nbsp; We asked him to tell us some stories about the
hotel.&nbsp; We didn't tell him what room we were in, but he proceeded
to talk about room 19 first.&nbsp; He said people had experienced
noises, smelled cigar smoke, the chandelier moving and temperature
changes.&nbsp; Patty and I looked at each other and busted out
laughing.&nbsp; The poor host had no idea what was so funny until we
told him what room we were in.&nbsp; <br>
We did sleep with the lights on that night, just in case.&nbsp; Other than hearing a few noises, it was an uneventful night.<br>

My Home in Sweden<br>
<br>
By: malinsandell87@hotmail.com<br>
<br>
My name is Malin, I've just turned 21 and I live in Sweden. In my
parents house I've experienced some strange things that I really can't
explain. My sister and I have always felt that there is a presence,
other than us. My parents doesn't believe in that kind of things and
have always told us that it's just our imagination. One of the first
things I remember is that my father had gotten this stuffed animal that
looked like ET, he got it from his students as a present. I must have
been about four years old an had recently seen the movie with my
sister. And for some reason I thought that ET was the most scary thing
I've ever seen, so I didn't like this doll at all. In our basement
there are a lot of different rooms and in one of them we had a huge box
filled with stuffed animals. Every time I went down there I took the ET
doll and put it in the bottom of the box, under all the other stuffed
animals. But the next time I went down there the ET doll was lying on
top of the others again. This happened repeatedly, every time I went
down there. It didn't matter if I waited two days of two minutes. I of
course asked my sister and my parents about it but they swore that they
had nothing to do with it. Of course it could be so that they lied to
me every time I asked them but I find that hard to believe. Anyway, I
solved the problem a couple of years later by giving the ET doll to one
of the guys in my class.<br>
I constantly heard, and still hear, cracks and other sounds in their
house, footsteps and sometimes voices. They've always been there and I
guess I got used to it. But it took a few years before the next "big"
thing happened. I was 15 maybe 16 and had moved down to the bedroom
downstairs. I didn't like sleeping downstairs but it was either that or
a tiny room upstairs. One day I was sitting on my bed, writing in my
diary, when I heard a knock on the door. I was surprised becuase I was
alone in the house and hadn't heard either the car nor the door open. I
said come in but when no one entered I got up and opened the door. But
there was no one there. I thought it was strange but went back to my
diary. I had hardly time to pick up my pen before I heard another
knock. This happened a couple of times and really scared me so I locked
the door and crawled under the cover. Then I heard scratching outside
and froze, just to hear "meow". One of my cats. At first I thought that
it was my cat who had caused the knocking but I've never met a cat that
acually can knock that hard.<br>
Another time I was in the bathroom upstairs. I had just finished
washing my hands and was outside the bathroom when I remembered that I
left my watch on the shelf in front of the mirror. I turned to go get
it and took a step into the room when a bottle of lotion literally flew
of the windowsill and landed infront of my feet. The window was closed
and there was no wind to speak of outside. If the bottle had fallen of
the windowsill because it was placed unstable it would have fallen
right down in the cats litter box but instead it flew almost 13 feet. I
calmly went out of there, closed the door and got in to my room and
looked that door. I have also seen a boy in the basement, a teenager.
He's not transparent at all, he looks as real as you and me. I've only
got short glimpses of him but I know he has brown hair and green shirt.
For some reason I most often see him around Christmas and other
holidays. I wonder why? Even though some of this things scared me i've
never felt threatened so I guess whoever or whatever is present in my
parents house doesn't want to harm us.<br>

A Couple of My Experiences<br>
<br>
By: milothemusician@gmail.com<br>
<br>
The first one is from a show my band played in Milwaukee Wisconsin at the Rave - Eagles Ballroom.<br>
Theres a service elevator on the left, front side of the building, now
used by bands to bring heavy equipment up and down floors. my name is
Josh Van Ess, I play rhythm guitar in a band called Of Hatred, based
out of Stoughton, Oregon, and Madison Wisconsin. My band played the
second floor stage for a Viva la Bands show in 2007 (CKY, Cradle of
Filth, and GWAR). while I was hauling my half-stack guitar amp into the
shady-looking elevator, the door tried closing automatically on my
head. this wasn't an electrical problem because the elevator door and
gate are manually operated by pulling ropes. once in the elevator, i
closed the door and the gate, pushed the UP button on the control
panel, got halfway up, then the elevator had a seizure. it jerked to a
stop, and the dim light bulb flickered, then turned off for about a
minute and a half. one of the staff said it was just an electrical
problem, fatly wiring, rats chewing on wires, shady stuff like that.
another, more seasoned staff informed me that the wiring was brand new
and sealed, and I probably encountered one of the many local
apparitions and didn't even know it.<br>
The next one is from Stoughton Wisconsin, where 2 of my band mates lived for most of there lives.<br>
On one of my band's photo shoots, we took a walk down a bike trail that
has a foot bridge leading across the Yahara River. We started down
North Division Street, and took the bridge across the river. In the
middle of the bridge we all had the urge to stop and look North East
out onto the water. it was about 11:30pm, late spring. needless to say
we all stopped at Cheap Shots, one of the local bars on South Division
Street to learned about Old Man Weary and other such ghost stories.<br>
I don't believe in Ghosts. I don't mind being dared to walk through a
cemetery late at night, or sit in dark rooms to prove people are
ignorant and wrong. But this whole damn down is haunted. The entire
Stoughton length of the Yahara River, the River Side Cemetery, all the
old warehouses and plants off of South 4th Street, everything.<br>
you want to be scared, this is the place to be late at night.<br>

Playful Haunting<br>
<br>
By: malice197@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
My name is Austin, and I live Very close to the Stones River
Battlefield. We built our house here in summer of 2001, which is what
makes this haunting a little weird. Nobody has died in this house,
nobody left etc. They were just always here. Anyhow, when I was about
9, I remember one night waking up to a kid talking to me. I looked down
and the figure of a young boy was standing at the foot of my bed.
Naturally, I was scared shitless. Since that one incident I have had
regular experiences, but none of them malicious. I have even grown fond
of the ghosts and consider them&nbsp; welcomed guests in my house. For
the longest time I thought my younger brother were the only ones to
experience it, but recently my grandfather moved in with us, and just
last night (Wednesday, march 27), he commented about the spirits. This
brought things to a whole new light. My friends have also experienced
things when staying at my house, but like I said, most of it is
playful. For example, one time we were trying to make it move
something, and we turned around to find that the tv had turned itself
on. As I rose to turn it off, we heard a noise coming from my room, so
we went in, and found one of those nail-and-glass impression thingies
with a hand impression on it. Needless to say it was way too small for
anyone in my house to have made it. On occasion we have even coaxed
them into playing games with us, such as guessing numbers by rapping
against the wall and playing with our electronics. On several occasions
we have taken photos with hazes and even the figure of the very same
boy I saw all those years ago. Now, at age sixteen, I am almost sad to
be moving out in a couple years to go to college, because I will miss
my little playful friend whom I have grown so fond of. These
experiences have also helped solidify my faith that there IS life after
death. I write this letter to let people know that not all hauntings
are malicious, and as is the case with my brother and I, sometimes they
are even quite enjoyable, like a friend who never goes home.<br>

St Augustine Lighthouse tour<br>
<br>
By: Sburke46@hotmail.com<br>
<br>
During a stay in St Augustine in Dec 07 I was on the lighthouse tour
and during part of the tour I pulled out a chair to sit down and the
tour guide saw the chair pulled out from underneath me. I had just told
my daughter that I never got any good experiences from the house behind
the lighthouse so I was not going to take pictures. I was wrong.<br>

True Paranormal Stories<br>
<br>
By: sumokurt1@att.net<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The first story concerns an apparent zombie I encountered
while driving home late one night. It was about 1 a.m. and I was
driving home from my girlfriend's house on a dark unlit road. About one
hundred yards ahead I saw a shadow figure lurching into the street and
weaving. I thought it was probably someone drunk, so I slowed down. The
shadow figure then stopped in the middle of the road and kept swaying
back and forth. I slowed down to about 5 mph, because I didn't want the
person to fall into my car. As I drove past I looked at him through the
passenger window and all my hair immediately stood on end. This guy had
all the physical features of a black man, the afro hairstyle, thick
lips, large cheek bones, but he was white as a sheet of paper.
Inhumanly white. Also, all his clothes looked like they had been
bleached white. Worst of all, his face was all screwed up and twisted
sideways, and his mouth hung open a good six inches, much more than
physically possible. My immediate reaction was that the guy was dead. I
drove away, a bit freaked out, but I still looked back at him in the
rear view mirror. He slowly turned toward my car and when he was
directly facing me, two beams of intense white light, like laser beams,
shot from his eyes and flew into my car.&nbsp; There were no other cars
around and no streetlights on that road.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The second story concerns a ghost hunt I did at Galster
Park in West Covina, CA which is listed on The Shadowlands. I initially
did not know the park was haunted or listed on your site. The first
time I went there, upon entering the park I heard a loud scream as if
someone had fallen down one of the hilly trails nearby. I walked to the
edge of the drop off and called out, but no one answered.&nbsp; There
was no one there, but one of the trees at the bottom was shaking
crazily back and forth, not swaying with the wind, but very rapidly
trembling as if in fear. I thought maybe a coyote got a rabbit, so I
went down to check it out, but there was nothing there. At home that
night I was looking for local haunted places in So Cal and I saw
Galster Park on your site and read about the screams heard there. <br>
I went back the next week with my ghost hunting kit, and we walked the
trails. Everything seemed normal, until I got a caution reading on my
ELF meter. So I did some temperature checks, and in that very spot the
temperature kept reading 28 degrees over and over, even though
everywhere else I pointed it ranged from 69-72 degrees. So I got out my
digicam and tried to take a picture, and all of the sudden the digicam
didn't want to work. It was freshly charged and the memory was fine.
Finally, the digicam clicked halfway, and then a large<br>
black X appeared on the LCD display and the camera shut down
completely. I went home and looked in the manual and could find nothing
about a big black X on the LCD. I called the factory and their tech
support people told me the camera didn't have the capability to make
such a mark, and they had no idea what I was talking about. The next
day, the camera started working again. I looked to see if there was
anything in the one picture I thought I had managed to take and there
were a bunch of strange swirls and orbs in that picture.&nbsp; I have
since moved away, so I haven't gone back to Galster Park, but that was
a strange episode I'll never forget.<br>

Weird Story<br>
<br>
By: some_dude_on_computer@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
<br>
Hey Dave.&nbsp; You got a weird story.&nbsp; Mine is getting weirder by
the month.&nbsp; That's why I'm e-mailing you.&nbsp; To tell you my
story.&nbsp; But if there's another way to get this on the Shadowlands,
please tell me.<br>
My 'Feelings'<br>
Over the past eight years, I have thought something haunted the
confines of this house.&nbsp; Being twelve years old, this is
SCARY.&nbsp; My experiences are short lived, but they pop up
randomly.&nbsp; However, I still have two long-term 'gut feeling'
places:&nbsp; My parents' room, and the basement.&nbsp; <br>
Ah, the basement.&nbsp; Said to be the makeshift fortress in times of
danger.&nbsp; I think there is DANGER down THERE.&nbsp; I am one to be
afraid of the dark, but there are feelings I get.&nbsp; Feelings that
tell me to get out.&nbsp; Almost... a communication from my
location.&nbsp; The basement has been home to incidents experienced by
me and my slightly older sister.&nbsp; My experience is weird.&nbsp; I
went downstairs to retrieve something for my mom, when just when I was
near the stairs, an opaque dark shade of gray temporarily blinded
me.&nbsp; Whilst running up the stairs and wiping my eyes, I swore I
heard something.&nbsp; My sister heard something, too.&nbsp; she was on
the downstairs computer, once.&nbsp; It had basic features.&nbsp; She
SWORE she heard something whisper something close to her name.&nbsp; My
sister sprinted upstairs as well.<br>
Finally, my parents' room.&nbsp; I come in on rare occasions, like when
the light and TV is on, or when my mom or dad are watching a good
movie.&nbsp; My room is on the end of the hall.&nbsp; Ugh, I
know.&nbsp; I need to pass my parents' room.&nbsp; When I pass their
room, I see strange things at the end of the bed.&nbsp; I see dark,
almost impish figures.&nbsp; Once, I could've sworn I've seen red eyes.<br>
Now, for the sound.&nbsp; It is very creepy, yet inconclusive.&nbsp; I
have no idea of what the sound actually is.&nbsp; Once, when the family
and I were in the living room, I heard a broom sweep in the back of the
house.&nbsp; Weird part?&nbsp; THERE WAS NO BROOM IN THE BACK OF THE
HOUSE!&nbsp; Plus, just today on 3/20/2008, I heard something in my
room exhale.&nbsp; I know it wasn't me.&nbsp; That had freaked me
out.&nbsp; The 'feeling.'&nbsp; I think I may have actually been
touched.&nbsp; Once, when I was eight or nine, I was watching a show on
Urban Legends.&nbsp; I felt something run something gently down my
back.&nbsp; It was around ten or eleven, but I got up anyway, and I
went to the living room, where I found my mom.&nbsp; I told her what
happened, but she said it was just the curtains.<br>

Salt Lake City<br>
<br>
By: J8cie@msn.com<br>
<br>
I lived in a home in North Salt Lake City that my children and myself
had many experieces over the years that we never could explain other
than the supernatural.&nbsp; My husband, myself and two children lived
in this house for over 12 years. There is a family that now lives in
the house and I do not want to cause them any problems by giving out
the address of the house, I will say that the house is located on Fifth
North.&nbsp;&nbsp; My children attended Jackson Elementary school when
they were young and graduated from West High School.&nbsp; <br>
My daughter was sleeping and thought she heard her name called and when
she opened her eyes, there was a man with a beard sitting in a rocking
chair holding a hat in his lap.&nbsp; My daughters bed was hung from
the ceiling with chains and her bed was four feet from the floor.&nbsp;
My daughter said the man turned his head towards her and grinned at
her.&nbsp; She also said that the rocking chair was even with her bed
and was four feet off the floor.&nbsp; She told me she pulled the
covers over her head and when she peeked out of the covers he was gone.<br>
My son told me of a man with beard and top hat sat on the end of his
bed, my son heard his name called and when he looked in the direction
of the speaker (the man sitting on his bed) the man grinned at
him.&nbsp; My son pulled the covers over his head and when he looked
out the man was gone. <br>
I was alone in the house for a few days and on two different nights I
was awoken to the sound of music, violen and tinkly sounding piano, the
lights were on in the kitchen and frontroom, as I entered the kitchen
from my bedroom the music stopped and the lights dimmed and as I
entered the frontroom the lights dimmed and I found myself standing in
the middle of the frontroom in the dark.&nbsp;&nbsp; I heard footsteps
in the stairwell and when I got to the bottom of the stairs the lights
were on upstairs.&nbsp;&nbsp; I started walking up the stairs and with
each step the lights got dimmer and about at the fifth step it was now
dark upstairs.&nbsp; I could write about many other things that
happened at this house, we never felt anything evil with our
experiences at this house, and it was always our own fear that scared
us.<br>

Nitecap Inn Palmyra, Wi.<br>
<br>
By: patty@maqs.net <br>
<br>
You may want to do some investigating on the history of Nightcap Inn in Palmyra, Wi.<br>
I had heard rumors of a ghost haunting this place many, many years ago. I myself had<br>
a strange encounter at the Inn. I had heard stories of an elderly women that haunted<br>
the bar and restaurant here, a kind soul that didn't want to leave.<br>
A friend and myself stopped in on a Sunday afternoon to have a drink at the bar and<br>
although I had heard the stories years prior I hadn't given it a second thought until I<br>
had a strange occurrence in the ladies room. <br>
I left the bar and went into the bathroom, after I had washed my hands, I reached out<br>
to open the door and although I had indeed unlocked the door I could not open it. I must<br>
of struggled with this door for what seemed like an eternity and felt foolish, until it turned<br>
to panic. I thought to myself, my friend will help me out here eventually, but to no avail.<br>
Finally, I spoke outloud and said- o.k. now, you can let me out and the door creaked<br>
open like there was never a problem and just as I finished the
sentence. At this point my panic had turned to fear and my friend had
asked if I was O.K. after returning to the bar, he said that I was
sweating and was very pale. We finished our drinks and left.<br>

My Experience<br>
<br>
<br>
By: jolumb@btinternet.com<br>
<br>
When i was about 7 I was sat in my auntie's house. Whilst they were
getting the christmas tree down from the loft I trotted up the stairs
and sat underneath the loft . As my Auntie was handing the christmas
tree to my mum she sudennly dropped and it was so close to hitting me
on the head but suddenly a shiver went down my spine and something
pushed it away from me and left a red line down the wall . Also when my
Mum was pregnant with my older brother she was sat on the bottom step
in my aunties house and saw someone walk across the landing and thought
it was 1 of my auntie's but they were both sat in the kitchen when she
shoted my aunties name it just looked at her and went in my auntie's
bedroom . When she got in the kitchen she was shocked to see that both
of my aunties were perched upon there chairs drinking there tea ! The
house that they live in was once really old cottages and I have allways
wondered if anyone died in them. I am only 11 and I can remeber that
day like it was yesterday , I still wont go upstairs in that house by
my self as my aunties often hear bang's when nobody is in the house but
them . Shadowlands and haunting's is a fantastic sight and i allways
look at the real experiances x .<br>

Little Girl Ghost<br>
<br>
By: sugarfoot5276@netzero.net<br>
<br>
<br>
I don't know if she is real or just my active imagination--<br>
I have caught this figure of a little girl many, many, many times, out
of the corner of my eyes, over the course if 19 years in my home. She
looks about 5 or 6 years old, Caucasian, wears a long white night gown,
with long sleeves, and one of the colonial style sleeping caps. She has
long dark wavy hair. She is usually&nbsp; in the tiny hallway of
my--get this---double wide trailer--which we set on this spot
ourselves, deep in the woods,&nbsp; 19 years ago. When I turn to face
her, she is normally (?!) looking at me but is quick to fade, or move
into my daughter's room. There's no 'typical ghost' stuff---no crying,
no talking, no sounds at all--just a brief vision on my part, a blank
stare on her part, and that's it--she's gone. The occurrences aren't
frightening--never have been. It has never occured to me to have them
investigated--still doesn't---I just thought I'd share my 'Little
Girl'. One more thing....as far as we know, there has never been a
house on this spot.....it was farmland.<br>

Hauntings<br>
<br>

<br>
First off, I would like to tell you I love your site. I actually live
in Anne Arundel County, Maryland. In Pasadena.&nbsp; I attended George
Fox Middle School and My Father attended when the mentioned Ghost
Principal was alive and there.&nbsp; It is definately true she is there
but I have never been there after dark, but I have seen students
walking in the basement level fall on their face for no apparent
reason.&nbsp; We just laughed like all kids do.&nbsp; I actually live
in a haunted house about 20 blocks from the school. We do not like
people to visit at all though. It gets on my dads nerves.&nbsp; The
smithsonian has come out to take lead scratchings of the tombstones in
our back yard. There is a small graveyard of settlers from the 1700 and
1800 there. most of them died from a plague.&nbsp; There is a book in
the library of congress called "The Bonds of Earth" that is written
about the families that are buried there.&nbsp; The only true "ghost"
form we have seen since living there is a little girl in a white dress.
She seems happy and is always smiling.&nbsp; We have never tried to get
rid of her cause we feel she belongs there just as much as we do.&nbsp;
Our animals do act crazy sometimes and there used to be a locking door
to our front room that would always mysteriously open by itself. My
father finally replaced it with a sliding door that is always open
anyway.&nbsp; Sometimes the doorknobs turn and things just dissapear,
like toys and small things.&nbsp; In fact, while cleaning my room a few
months ago (which I do almost every week) I found an ET Shrinky Dink
with my name written on it just laying next to my door.&nbsp; I havent
seen those things since I was 6 or so.&nbsp; I actually feel at peace
in that house. I moved away for about 3 years until my mother passed
away suddenly.&nbsp; and yes, I can hear her walking around sometimes
too.&nbsp; She had cancer but died suddenly of a heart attack in the
home. <br>
I guess the most important thing is not to fear what you do not
understand. I just talk to them when I feel their presence and have
never had a problem.&nbsp; Once again thanks for your site, it is
awesome.<br>

Harrisburg State Hospital, Harrisburg Pa<br>
<br>
<br>
By: jproney@yahoo.com<br>
<br>
Hello. A friend sent me this link. I saw and read the entry on the
State Hospital. I worked there in building 21 from 1995 till 1999. It
is a 90 day co-ed drug and alcohol rehab. I was the night house
manager. I would see and hear and experience many strange, weird and
frightening things there at night. <br>
When i would question other staff members if they had ever had anything
strange happen to them on the night shift I was surprised at all the
responses I got. Everything from noises and sightings to actually being
smacked in the face by unseen " things " to being pushed from behind at
the top of the old slate stairs ( This was in daylight, when all the
clients were in groups )<br>
I will relate one of my experiences to you. If you want to know more I will include my Email address.<br>
This was an encounter with what I came to call " The Dread" because of
the feelings of terror that would unexpectedly come over me when this
thing was near.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Staff offices were on the first floor as well
as the women's dorms, men's dorms on the second floor. One set of steps
leading to the second floor, one down to the basement with the door
leading to the tunnels locked. All staff members had a key to this
door, keep in mind I was the only staff member in the building from
11pm till 7am.<br>
It always began at 3 am and would last till 5am.<br>
I would be sitting in my office doing paper work ( my office located
just off the kitchen/dinning area ) or making my rounds when the hair
on the back of my neck would stand up and a feeling of absolute terror
would come over me. It always felt like it was coming from outside of
me in waves. Along with this came waves of&nbsp; rage and hate. It
always came from the kitchen area and the more afraid I became the
stronger the entity would grow. It was like it was feeding off of
negative emotions.<br>
i would go into the kitchen to make sure everything was alright ( this
was part of my hourly rounds ) and would feel like some " thing " was
behind me and I mean right up on me and feeling like I would be
attacked. The feeling would grow weaker once I left the kitchen to do
the rest of my rounds but when I would get closer to the kitchen it
would get stronger. Going thru the door way to the kitchen was like
walking through an electric field.<br>
It would fade and go away at 5 but each night it would be stronger. One
night ( the worst ) i could sense/feel where it was but couldn't see
it. I t felt like it was trying to get behind me to leap on my back. It
also felt like it had once been human but now no longer was. It was
evil feeling. There's just no other word for it. It felt like it had a
hatered for anything living<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had my back towards the wall with a large 4 pot
coffee machine behind me and this thing in front. The machine turned on
and started making nosies, the red light on the switch lit up. But the
machine was unplugged. to say I was scared is an understatement. This
thing had me trapped for awhile. I felt that if i moved, I would be
attacked. it finally faded as it got closer to 5 and I was able to get
out of the kitchen. I didn't go back in till the sun came up and the
clients started getting up. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had many many encounters with this thing over the
course of two weeks till I discovered how to get rid of it. I also had
encounters with other entities while working there. I'm getting tired
of typing now but feel free to contact me at " jproney@yahoo.com " if
you'd like to hear more about my experiences. I am a former Marine,
have an AA degree in Human Services and was working towards my BS in
Psychology. I have done extensive research in many areas including
various religions, spiritually, etc. In short, I'm not some flake
looking for attention.<br>

Face in the TV and Man at the Doorway<br>
<br>
By: Thisisjl@aol.com<br>

<br>
I believe the house I grew up in was haunted but my family all make
jokes about how it was all just my imagination.&nbsp; There were
several different occurrences throughout my childhood nothing on a
regular basis but frequent enough for me to believe that something
paranormal was going on there.&nbsp; I lived in this house from birth
until 18 years old.&nbsp; I am now much older and I still believe what
I saw and felt there was real and unexplainable. <br>
As a child I always woke up in the night to get a drink of water or a
snack even sometimes.&nbsp; I wasn't overweight but it was a running
joke in my house that I always had to get up to get something to eat at
night.&nbsp; On several of these occasions I would walk out of my
bedroom down the short hall and into the living room where we had one
of those old TV's that when you turned them off the colors would dance
for a short while and then go out.&nbsp; My parents were early to bed
early to rise so I know the TV hadn't been "just" shut off but I would
go out and there would be a human face made from those colors that
usually would just swim around when it was shut off.&nbsp; I watched
the TV during the day and shut it off and always watched to see what
the colors did but they never made the "face" during the day only at
night after the TV had been off for hours.<br>
The second occurrence that freaked me out completely was on night I was
standing at the refridgerator which was on the same wall as the doorway
that lead down to a small landing which is where the back door was and
the stairs to the basement were (I always felt watched down stairs and
couldn't stand going down at night even with all the lights on, I could
do it fine during the day but at night it freaked me out).&nbsp; Anyway
the night I'm speaking of I turned my head to the doorway, the only
illumination was the light from the refridgerator, and there was a
fully formed person peering around the corner from the side that would
have been coming up the stairs.&nbsp; The horrible thing about it was
that at first I thought it was my step-dad but then I got a look at its
face a little closer and it was his face but almost evil looking I
swear it had red eyes but that could have been a miss interpretation of
what I saw.&nbsp; I ran back down to where all of the bedrooms were and
I peeked in my parents room and he was still in bed.&nbsp; I've never
found an explanation of why it would have been his likeness I saw at
the top of the stairs that night.<br>

Assisted Living Senior Place<br>
<br>
By: angela.salgado.pfb3@statefarm.com<br>
This story I'm about to tell you guys just happened to me last
Saturday. I work in Recollections in a Avalon Senior Assisting Living,
I'm a caregiver. This is my first time working in these type of stuff.
This last month a virus was around there that took the lives of&nbsp; 7
residents that I miss very much. Through out time I hear other
caregivers talk about experience they had. Mostly are the ones that
work NOC shift. But to be honest with you guys I am not scare. Well
enough about that. I always wonder if they would ever do something to
me&#8230; you know scare me too. But I would always doubt about it&#8230;.until
last Saturday. We were all ready to have Dinner and almost all the
residents were there already with the Mec tech and other
caregivers&#8230;.except for a few residents. While they pass the food I
decided to go get the ones that were left&#8230; and it was lonely in the
hall way because the ones that needed to be pick up were all the way at
the end&#8230; All of the sudden when I was walking down the hall way I pass
a room where one of the residents was before she die. She was the first
one to die and it took a long process&#8230;anyway&#8230;when I pass the room I
clearly heard the door knob turning as if somebody was going to come
out the room. I thought it was Sam one of our residents that wonders
around so I open the door to supposable get him out but when I did
nobody was there&#8230; I just smile and close the door and pretended like if
nothing happen. I guess she just did that to let me know she's still
there with us&#8230; Like I said in the beginning I'm not scare of them&#8230; But
I honestly miss them very much&#8230;. <br>

Haunted Niagara Falls Air Force Base<br>
<br>
By: popadyn85@yahoo.com <br>
<br>
Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station is a quiet base that has a key role
in the community. This small station run by the 914th and 107th has had
many ghost stories over its long history. Once being a active Air Force
base opening in 1928 as a municiple air port then turned over to the
Army Air Corp in the 40s. The Air Force began to take over in the late
50s. But behind the quiet walls and friendly faces you meet at the main
gate there are many ghost stories surrounding here. i worked on the
base full time for almost 20 years until around 2003 and all my career
have heard and seen many unexplained things. Many of my friends in
Security Forces have told me about our CE building where a spirit seems
to play games with them. Things have been reported such as whispering
in the night and knocking on the glass doors while doing late night
building checks. In the 90s i found this interesting and checked it out
only to find to men died in the building for unknown reasons. A army
sgt that had worked with SF told me of a gate shack near the Air Guard
Headquarters where he seen a army drill Sgt in full dress walk around
the gate and vanish. This to me is truthful because a security forces
member that i worked with died tragically while being deployed and he
was once a drill sgt. I havent talked to many people since i retired
but a few guys were talking at the NCO club about a new vechicle search
pit that was built a few years ago that has eerie feelings and
sometimes things are seen on camera, but when i questioned them they
seemed to laugh it off and ignore my questions. This base is not new to
death we have had a Blue angel crash and die on base and our own
fighters crash in the 70s and 80s. Not many people know but three guard
buildings were once used as morgues in the 50s. There is said to be
alot of construction on base and a body was found while digging around
2002<br>

I have a personal experience from Cubs Loft in Berkeley Springs, WV.
While vacationing there, we decided to put a recorder in the basement
game room after seeing a figure. When we listened to it, you could hear
someone playing either the boccerball game or pool. We tried to debunk
it by having someone walk on the floor above us, but could not. We also
tried to debunk it by searching the maintenance room, but cound not
hear a sond even close to what we heard.<br>

SMOKEY-JOE LITTLE RICHARD GRANDBERRY<br>
<br>
By: honeyfoxey1@hotmail.com<br>
<br>
<br>
Smokey was born in Vancouver, Washington to a mother that rejected
him.&nbsp; He was the runt of the litter: coal black with huge, bright
green eyes.&nbsp; To me he looked like the little kitten on the Tidy
Cat litter bags<br>
The lady that brought him to me had him in this huge TV box so when she
lifted him out; I was totally shocked and surprised because he fit in
the palm of her hand.&nbsp; I fell INSTANTLY in love with him!<br>
Later on that day I found out that Smokey needed to be fed via
eyedropper.&nbsp; So, for his first couple of weeks; he was transported
around inside my robe; also because he shivered so much.<br>
As he grew (he ended up being around 12 pounds) he developed this habit
of wanting to be in the room with me ONLY whenever I was attempting to
undress.&nbsp; He also developed this extremely annoying habit of
sitting across the room and just staring at me.&nbsp; He didn't do this
to his dad, just me.&nbsp; It got so through the years it drove me
crazy!&nbsp; Imagine thinking that you are alone in your room only to
discover eyes watching you from under the bed (because he would sneak
in past you).&nbsp; This was Smokey!<br>
He traveled well too!&nbsp; And boy did we travel!&nbsp; Most of the
time out of necessity due to either deaths in the family or just having
to move but he was my companion throughout it all.<br>
One particular time will always stand out in my mind:<br>
My son (he was 19, my daughter was 13 but I did not have custody of
her, she was the reason for the move) and I had traveled via Greyhound
from Minneapolis Minnesota to Portland Oregon to move me from Portland,
Oregon BACK to Minneapolis, Minnesota.&nbsp; (See what I mean about
traveling all the time?).<br>
We were in a rental truck on a highway in the state of Wyoming and
Smokey was sitting in his usual spot--on the dashboard.&nbsp; It was
just past midnight and we were bless-fully going north avoiding a
vicious storm that was approaching from the South.<br>
Our sky was crystal clear.&nbsp; We were riding along; my son was half
asleep, when Smokey started doing that thing that some cats do when
they spot a bird.&nbsp; I turned down the radio to really listen.&nbsp;
There, he was doing it again!&nbsp; Now why in the heck would he be
doing this in the middle of the night?&nbsp; And what birds were flying
around at night?&nbsp; Well, my answer was that Smokey had spotted this
pale, round, beigey-colored object in the sky just to our right.&nbsp;
At first I told him it was the Moon but the Moon was not in the
sky.&nbsp; I pulled over and awoke my son and the three of us--for the
next approximately 15 minutes--watched this object as it moved from our
right to our left, then disappeared.<br>
Anyway, years passed and Smokey was my companion until his dad and I
reciprocally agreed to separate.&nbsp; I stayed in Oregon and he moved
to another state.&nbsp; He took Smokey with him and we still keep very
much in touch.<br>
Again years passed and one day last month I am sitting watching TV with
my two cats, Oliver Wendell and Macey Grey (who were both asleep) when
just IN my line of vision I see this short, black shadow elongate
around the corner going towards our (my daughter--yes, I got her
back&#8212;emotionally broken but safe with me now) bedrooms.&nbsp; I sat
there trying to figure out what it was then finally chalking it up to
my imagination, went back to watching TV.<br>
A day later, my daughter tells me that she was in bed facing the wall
when she felt what she thought was one of the cats jump up onto her
bed; mind you her bedroom door was shut.&nbsp; She said she didn&#8217;t move
but playfully scolded them to get out of her room.&nbsp; A few seconds
later the purring was so loud and full of bass that it was vibrating
the bed.&nbsp; The vibrating lulled her back to sleep.<br>
Sadly, it was a month later that during a conversation with Smokey&#8217;s
dad he informed me that Smokey had passed away.&nbsp; He told me he had
sent me an email, this was about a month before (November), but I never
got it because he had sent it to an email address that had just become
invalid.<br>
This confirmed what my daughter and I believed we were
experiencing&#8212;visitations.&nbsp; Smokey had died in November&#8212;a month
before our experiences.&nbsp; And as I type this up, the last
experience I had was the night before last; I saw one of his eyes in
his famous peeking-at-you-with-one-eye stunt.<br>
You know, my cat Oliver reminds me a lot of Smokey, Oliver is orange
but he weighs in at a whopping 16 pounds.&nbsp; At four months old, he
was rescued from a taped up box sat upon the railroad tracks.<br>
As I am typing this; he&#8217;s yet again vocalizing and chasing after
something--not his sister.&nbsp; He jumps, arches his back and
vocalizes for whatever it is.&nbsp; He just started doing this around
Thanksgiving.&nbsp; And again no, he is not vocalizing at his sister,
Macey.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, she keeps following him around as if
she is saying, &#8220;Play with me too!&#8221;<br>
I love and miss you, Smokey.&nbsp; RIHP<br>

i graduated peoria high in 2004 and during my senior year i worked with
the maintenance and custodial staff and one of the buildings i cleaned
was the performing arts center and i was working with another custodian
and i went into the back to get something and i walked by the band room
and the light was off and when i passed by the light was on the
custodian i was working with was in the front of the building at the
time...there has been issues with the electrical system lights would
flicker for no reason and have been checked out by maintenance and
nothing unusual...while cleaning the stage i would get a very weird
feeling like something was in the building with me but i never heard
any voices due to the fact i played a stereo when i cleaned the
stage...i asked about if the building was haunted but was never given
an answer the question just went ignored<br>

My Little Bugger<br>
<br>

Okay it was around midnight. I sleep on top of the bunk bed along with
my other two sisters in the same room. I had a little of a insomnia
because i father has it. It was winter, cold as always, i heard my
brother talk in his sleep and almost laughed because they always do
that. Except for me though.<br>
One night, i was bored and was reading my book quietly until i heard
the washroom door open then close quickly.; This repeated over a couple
of times during the night while i kept reading my book/. I got tired
and pulled the blankets to my chin, freezing then all of sudden, i
heard quick little footsteps running up the stairs, making a ruckus
like a little child would when he or she is hyper and happy. Well, i
sat up and hushed. I knew it was my parents or my older siblings
because they were out and asleep. Then i heard nothing for awhile until
i crept back to the covers until i felt a presence watching me. <br>
In my physical sense, i could see auras and i saw one aura in the my
doorway, clutching the door, looking at me. Chills ran through my
entire body. Before i took a better look, it ran into my parent's room,
paused, then down the stairs and into the washroom. I cursed myself
knowing i was probably dreaming. Then i heard my brother gasp from his
bedroom door which was directly by the stairway. I look down and found
my brother standing at the bottom of the stair, looking at me with
tears in his eyes which frightened me because he whispered up to me and
said, "Georgina, someone is here" while pointing to the kitchen.<br>
I sighed, knowing it was really a dream. I checked for him while he
clutched his own door. I noticed the stance he was in from upstairs and
almost blamed him when i heard the same walking up the stairs again. My
brother just nodded and went back to bed. I looked at him weirdly and
went back to bed. <br>
A couple of hours later, around 4 in the&nbsp; morning, i and the same
sensation as if someone's watching me only, his or her face was right
in mine. I only stare and was petrified. I went to push the child away
but she or he laughs and goes back downstairs. I screamed out loud when
something jumped on my bed. Hoping it would go away, my light turned on
when my parents came in, asking what was wrong. (They knew i had these
kind of senses and helped me develop them.) i told them everything but
they just nodded and went back to bed. Half an hour later, i kept
haring the same thing, running up and down the stairs, washroom door
opening and closing. <br>
That experienced happened a couple of times and by the time my
sixteenth birthday, it totally stopped. Still, i shake every time i
couldn't sleep. <br>
I was living in Ontario, and this happened since i was fifteen. Also,
my best friend died a long time ago when i was six a day before my
birthday which was the most occurring paranormal activities.&nbsp; this
is true but the insane thing was; my mother, father and brother had no
memories and couldn't evident what had happened. I freaked out and
never slept with my door open again.<br>
