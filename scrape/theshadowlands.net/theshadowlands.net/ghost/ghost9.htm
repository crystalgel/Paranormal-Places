<P>
<P> <B>Several years ago my family and I moved to New Hampshire. We bought

a</B>
<P><B>huge, 200+ year old house, with about 200 acres of land to go with
it. We</B>
<P><B>had this room with an antique piano in it. It was old and very out
of tune.</B>
<P><B>A lot of the keys didn't even work or would get stuck. One night, I
was in</B>
<P><B>the kitchen. I was alone in the house by several strange coincedences

(my</B>
<P><B>mom was taking my brother to the hospital because he had gotten very

sick,</B>
<P><B>and my dad was at the house next door "only for a minute"). Anyway,
I began</B>
<P><B>to hear piano music. It was in perfect tune, coming from the room with

the</B>
<P><B>piano in it. However, to get to the room, I had to cross through

several</B>
<P><B>unlit rooms and hallways, then enter the piano room and turn on the
lights -</B>
<P><B>and the lightswitch happened to be right next to the piano. I couldn't

bring</B>
<P><B>myself to do it, even though I wasn't fearful of whatever was playing

the</B>
<P><B>piano. After a few minutes, the music stopped. Then my dad came home.

I</B>
<P><B>didn't say anything, but together we went to the room with the piano.
I sat</B>
<P><B>down to try to play it - and it was horribly out of tune as it had
always </B>
<P><B>been. </B>

<H3><A NAME="my father">My Father</A>
</H3><P><B>by dbrodie@voicenet.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>I first felt a presence shortly after my father committed suicide in
our </B>
<P><B>second floor bathroom.  I would often smell the scent of his cologne,
or </B>
<P><B>feel a very cold, icy breeze pass by me, especially when my mother
and I </B>
<P><B>would be sitting together in our kitchen.  I never asked her if she
had </B>
<P><B>any experiences, and for this I am sorry.  Several people, who did
not </B>
<P><B>know where my father had died, claimed to have seen him in our bathroom,

</B>
<P><B>and they described the clothing he had worn on the day he died.  The
</B>
<P><B>night before my mother passed away, she was lying in a hospital bed
in </B>
<P><B>our living room with my husband and my aunt and I by her side.  She
kept </B>
<P><B>looking up the flight of stairs with her eyes very wide, and tears
</B>
<P><B>streaming down her face.  My aunt asked her if she saw her father,
or </B>
<P><B>mother and she said no.  She asked her if she saw my father, and she
</B>
<P><B>said yes.  My mother reached out her arms, the lights went out, the
dog </B>
<P><B>howled, and my mother lapsed into a deep coma and passed away early
the </B>
<P><B>next morning.  Soon afterward, my husband saw my father and actually
</B>
<P><B>described him to me, although he had never seen a picture of him! 
Many </B>
<P><B>nights I thought my husband was getting into bed with me, I actually
</B>
<P><B>felt someone climb into the bed, but when I turned to kiss him, there

</B>
<P><B>was no one there!  Other times I would hear very heavy and slow </B>
<P><B>footsteps, the door to our bedroom (which had actually been my parents

</B>
<P><B>bedroom at one time) would open, a very icy cold breeze would brush
past </B>
<P><B>me, and someone or something would climb into bed.  One night shortly

</B>
<P><B>after my mothers death, my fathers college ring appeared on my bureau.

 </B>
<P><B>I was certain that we had buried my father with his ring, and upon
</B>
<P><B>checking this with my brothers, was absolutely certain we had.  I hid

</B>
<P><B>the ring in a drawer, but it constantly appeared on my dresser.  I
</B>
<P><B>finally gave it to my oldest brother and that is where the ring is
</B>
<P><B>today.  We did not have any experiences for quite some time after that,

</B>
<P><B>but when we were trying to decide whether or not to move, we had many

</B>
<P><B>more experiences, as though my father wanted me to leave.  There was
</B>
<P><B>constant noisy footsteps during the night, and he would appear at the

</B>
<P><B>foot of our bed, frightening my husband.  Finally, we decided to move,

</B>
<P><B>and when I came to the house one last time, I had difficulty opening
the </B>
<P><B>door, it was not stuck, but actually was pushed as I was attempting
to </B>
<P><B>enter.  When I left, the door was slammed shut behind me.  One other
</B>
<P><B>thing that was odd, whenever I was in the house and feeling depressed,

</B>
<P><B>my childhood friend who had lived next door to me for many years would

</B>
<P><B>suddenly call and tell me that my father had contacted her through
her </B>
<P><B>dreams to tell her I was depressed and to make sure that I was okay
and </B>
<P><B>did not do as he did!  This always gave me the chills!</B>

<H3><A NAME=enslaved>The Forever Enslaved Ghost</A>
</H3><P><B>by &nbsp;janelledavis@sisna.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>Not more than one year ago, I was at a birthday party for my best</B>
<P><B>friend, Erika. Almost everyone was beyond the stage of intoxication.

My</B>
<P><B>three friends and I were the only sober ones there. We decided to clean

up</B>
<P><B>the house and get the other poeple home. Taylor and Keri drove the

others</B>
<P><B>home while Nicole and I stayed to clean up. We started to clean up

the</B>
<P><B>living room and then we moved into the kitchen. Erika's house is over

200</B>
<P><B>years old and really big. To get to the kitchen, you had to go through

the</B>
<P><B>study and the library. I felt really uneasy in the library. I

couldn't</B>
<P><B>figure out why. But, as I was going through ther I heard a voice calling

out</B>
<P><B>my name and asking for help. I asked Nicole if she said or heard

anything</B>
<P><B>and she said no.</B>
<P><B>A  few seconds later, I heard it again. This time was more clear and
I could</B>
<P><B>tell it was a male's voice. I turned around to see if anyone was

there...</B>
<P><B>there wasn't. No more than five minutes later, the lights went out.
It was a</B>
<P><B>stormy night so we just thought the power lines were damaged by the</B>
<P><B>lightning. We looked to the neighbor's house and we saw that their

lights</B>
<P><B>were on. As we were looking back, we saw a solidblack figure looking
in on</B>
<P><B>us through the window. I grabbed a flashlight and I shined the light
in it's</B>
<P><B>face and I could see that it was transparent. After that the

apparition</B>
<P><B>dissapeared.</B>
<P><B>        The next morning I asked Erika if she knew who the previous
owner of</B>
<P><B>the house was and she said that it was a rich pyscopath that killed
all of</B>
<P><B>the slaves that killed his family. After he killed the slaves he buried

them</B>
<P><B>underneath the library. That is why I was so uneasy in that room. Erika

says</B>
<P><B>that she has been seeing the ghost ever since she moved in and she
was too</B>
<P><B>afraid to tell anyone.</B>

</H3><P><B>by rmvink@mtu.edu</B>
<P>
<P><B>My friend, Andrea, asked me to go to her cabin in Grayling, Michigan</B>
<P><B>with her for the weekend.  I was 12 years old, and expected to have
a</B>
<P><B>realy fun time that weekend.  I never thought that I would be

terrified.</B>
<P><B>Her room, at the cabin, had a bunkbed that was against the wall.  I

was</B>
<P><B>really exicted because I had never slept in one before.  I slept on

the</B>
<P><B>bottom, though, because I was afraid to fall out. </B>
<P>
<P><B>That night, her parents went out ot a movie, leaving just Andrea and

I</B>
<P><B>there.  Alone.  It gets really dark there because there are no street

or</B>
<P><B>city lights back in the woods.  We went to bed before her parents

came</B>
<P><B>home.  I had a hard time sleeping because I kept hearing strange

noises.</B>
<P><B>I actually became afraid to move.  I wouldn't move until I heard

Andrea</B>
<P><B>move.  About an hour or so later, I felt funny.  I looked over into

the</B>
<P><B>room.   I saw a pair of legs standing right next to the bed.  I was</B>
<P><B>paralyzed with fear.  I just shut my eyes and prayed that it would
go</B>
<P><B>away.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The next morning, when I awoke, I saw that a Kleenex box had been

moved</B>
<P><B>across the room, and a couple of other things had also moved.  I

asked</B>
<P><B>Andrea why she moved them, and she said she didn't.  She then

proceeded</B>
<P><B>to tell me that she thought that she had seen someone standing right</B>
<P><B>next to the bed.  I told her that I had too.  We were both terrified

to</B>
<P><B>ever sleep there again.  The next night we slept with a lit candle,

and</B>
<P><B>didn't see a thing.</B>
<P>
<P><B>When we told her parents of the sighting, her mom said that it was

our</B>
<P><B>imagination, and that Andrea shouldn't have told me the story of the</B>
<P><B>supposed ghost that lived there.  She did not ever tell me such a

story.</B>
<P><B>I had nothing in my head about ghosts living there.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Her Father had also woken up to see a man standing over him before
we</B>
<P><B>ever saw him.  I never went back to that cabin.  But now, at the age

of</B>
<P><B>21, I feel privileged to have seen what I saw.</B>

<P>
<P><B>The high school I attended was opened in 1915 and has been the site
of </B>
<P><B>many odd happenings.  One of my friend was a night custodian and has
</B>
<P><B>told be some of the stories that other custodians have seen.  The old

</B>
<P><B>night custodians would bring dogs with them andthe dogs would bark
at </B>
<P><B>walls and doorways and in the middle of the halls.  One night in 1990,

</B>
<P><B>one of the custodians was cleaning the top floor and something caught

</B>
<P><B>his eye.  When he looked up he saw a girl coming towards him in a blue

</B>
<P><B>dress.  She didn't have any arms or legs however.  He remembered the
</B>
<P><B>face put couldn't place it.  He got up and ran down the stairs.  The
</B>
<P><B>next day, he was looking at a plaque in the foyer of the school and
</B>
<P><B>realized were he had seen the girls face.  It was the same face as
the </B>
<P><B>picture in the plaque.  It was an article of 50 students that had died

</B>
<P><B>when a train had collied with a bus in the 1930's.  Her picture was
</B>
<P><B>there because she was one of the fatalites of the accident.  He believe

</B>
<P><B>that she had never realized that she died and continued her way to
</B>

<H3><A NAME=marjorie>Marjorie</A>
</H3><P><B>by jfwright@carol.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>This story was told to me by mother, and in the retelling, I will tell
it in</B>
<P><B>the first person as though she were telling it....</B>
<P>
<P><B>It is also important to understand that my mother and everyone on her

side</B>
<P><B>of the family is deaf due to a genetic disposition.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>The story:</B>
<P>
<P><B>I went to visit my cousins in Baltimore Maryland.  That night as we
went to</B>
<P><B>sleep, my cousins Marsha and Marjorie left a small light on the table

in</B>
<P><B>case I were to wake up and need anything.  We needed the light so that

we</B>
<P><B>could see to talk.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>I swear I had just laid down and had not even begun to get sleepy.
 I</B>
<P><B>noticed my cousin Marjorie climb down off the bunk bed above me.  She

leaned</B>
<P><B>over and began telling me (in sign language)  to tell her parents that

she</B>
<P><B>loved them, and not to worry about her.  She said that she would miss

them</B>
<P><B>very much, and that she hid the doll under the back porch.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>It was about that time that I noticed that Marjorie had no face, and

no</B>
<P><B>hands!  Yet I knew it was her, and I understood what she was saying.
 As I</B>
<P><B>began to get scared, she just suddenly faded away.  At the same time</B>
<P><B>something fell out of the bed above me, and I could feel it hit the
floor.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>It was Marjorie!  She had fallen out of bed, and died (I learned later)
of a</B>
<P><B>cerebral hemmorage.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>I tried to tell my Aunt and Uncle, but they were obviously disraught

and</B>
<P><B>kept telling me I was dreaming.  Later, they would ask how I knew about

the</B>
<P><B>doll. Apparently Marjorie had hidden her sister's doll somewhere and

had</B>
<P><B>refused to tell them where, or even if she had taken it .  They assumed

that</B>
<P><B>Marjorie must have told me.  I swore she didn't.  And she did not.
 I didn't</B>
<P><B>know anything about the doll.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>I don't know if it was precognition, or if she was dead and I saw her

ghost.</B>
<P><B>I guess I'll never know, but I do know that I saw something very

strange</B>
<P><B>that night.</B>
<P>
<P><B>That is the story as my mom told it to me.   </B>

<H3><A NAME=step-son>The Step-son</A>
</H3><P><B>by mhr7@cpsod1.em.cdc.gov</B>
<P>
<P><B>I just recently married to a wonderful lady who has a 10 year old boy
from a </B>
<P><B>previous marriage, and I love both of them very much.  Also I suspect
that </B>
<P><B>they are responsible for my unexplainable experiences.  Especially
the boy.</B>
<P>
<P><B>My wife has told me stories of a few instances that she has had.  The
most </B>
<P><B>troubling occurred when she was a small child.  One night she awoke
to the </B>
<P><B>sound of a hideous voice.  She rolled over to look at it and saw two
red </B>
<P><B>eyes in the dark.  Those eyes told her they were going to get her.
 She </B>
<P><B>swears to this day she was very awake.  Another peculiar instance 
happened </B>
<P><B>after she had had her boy, but years before she met me.  She had made
him </B>
<P><B>breakfast and called him to the table.  As he ate, she noticed him
staring </B>
<P><B>at the floor, his eyes following one or more things.  He then cautiously

</B>
<P><B>raised his feet, put down his spoon, and held his legs to his chest.
 All </B>
<P><B>the while, he never took his eyes off the floor.  Of course, my wife
saw </B>
<P><B>nothing.</B>
<P>
<P><B>My wife has told me that she has noticed, black darting shadows out
of the </B>
<P><B>corner of her eyes off and on throughout her life.  I have noticed
this only </B>
<P><B>once, about two weeks ago, around the end of June 1996.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Her son moved in with us a few weeks before we were married, and not
under </B>
<P><B>the most pleasant of circumstances, unfortunately.  We did our best
to make </B>
<P><B>him feel loved and welcome.  While he adjusted quickly, you could tell
he </B>
<P><B>was troubled from time to time.  And with his arrival came what I coined
as </B>
<P><B>our poltergeist.  Nothing really scary (like threatening red eyes),
just </B>
<P><B>little happenings.</B>
<P>
<P><B>In our room in the middle of the night, I've been awakened by our vertical

</B>
<P><B>blinds swaying and gently clacking on themselves.  No fan or air </B>
<P><B>conditioning was on, and only about three or four of them were moving.
 I </B>
<P><B>recognize the identical movement when I walk by the blinds which  creates
a </B>
<P><B>breeze that moves them.  Another day, my wife was just leaving for
work.  As </B>
<P><B>she looked back at the apartment while walking to her car, several
of the </B>
<P><B>vertical blinds were swaying considerably, and only on one end.  Again,
no </B>
<P><B>fan, no open window, no air conditioning.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Once, I shut the door of our old microwave oven.  It had been only
slightly </B>
<P><B>ajar, like it hadn't been closed good.  I shut it solidly, and to open
it </B>
<P><B>takes a bit of effort (it's old but it works too well to replace it).
 We </B>
<P><B>came back about two hours later, and the door was ajar again.  I showed
my </B>
<P><B>wife this at the time, but to this date it hasn't happened again.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Apparently, the most dramatic occurrence took place when neither my
wife or </B>
<P><B>me was there.  Our boy had come home from school and was in the apartment

</B>
<P><B>with friends.  The friends were in the back bedrooms and our son was
in the </B>
<P><B>kitchen on the other end of the apartment.  The friends said that the

</B>
<P><B>verticals in mine and my wife's room violently began shaking.  That
scared </B>
<P><B>them into our boy's room, where the horizontal blinds started shaking
in the </B>
<P><B>same way.  That's when they said they heard noises coming from the
walk-in </B>
<P><B>closet.  Then they all ran out of the apartment together, which happened
to </B>
<P><B>be about the same time I arrived home from work.  They were still wound
up </B>
<P><B>like tops.  They told me their breathless story, and when I went in
the only </B>
<P><B>evidence I saw was that the horizontal blinds DID look rather shaken.
 I </B>
<P><B>know they're just kids, but I'm inclined to believe them.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Things have quieted back down lately (knock on wood).  However, we're
about </B>
<P><B>to move, so we'll see if that doesn't shake things up again.</B>

</H3><P><B>by lilroundtop@juno.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>This story takes place in Alexandria, Kentucky.  It had been a</B>
<P><B>beautiful day all day.  My Aunt had just gotten married, and we were</B>
<P><B>partying at the reception.  Just for some background information</B>
<P><B>Alexandria is a small but growing town,  so you could imagine that

the</B>
<P><B>reception was on a farm.</B>
<P><B>	To hyper and wound up from about seven to ten caffeine filled</B>
<P><B>sodas us kids could not get to sleep till two in the morning.  The

last</B>
<P><B>people still awake in the house were me and my cousin Amie.  We were</B>
<P><B>still laughing and joking when suddenly we stopped laughing almost</B>
<P><B>simultaneously.</B>
<P><B>	My cousin Amie asked me what I was listening for.  I said, "Don't</B>
<P><B>you hear that?"  She answered with a funny look on her face, "Yeah."

 We</B>
<P><B>both heared pots moving in the kitchen.  We peaked around the corner

and</B>
<P><B>saw an open bottle of whiskey.  After that we tried to get to sleep,

but</B>
<P><B>the sound of liquid being poured into a glass awoke us again.  We

noticed</B>
<P><B>that some of the whiskey in the bottle was gone.</B>
<P><B>	After about a half hour of no noises me and my cousin were almost</B>
<P><B>asleep when we heared a man clear his throat.  Then we decided to go

into</B>
<P><B>the kitchen and find out what it was, but when we peaked around the</B>
<P><B>corner into the dinning room we saw a chair facing us, the scary

thing</B>
<P><B>about that is my grandmother always pushes the chairs in before going

to</B>
<P><B>bed.</B>
<P><B>	Next came the scariest part of the experience.  The cat came</B>
<P><B>running out from behind us and sat in front of the chair meowing as

if</B>
<P><B>there was some one there that the cat saw that she wanted to pet her.</B>
<P><B>	The very next morning we told every one about it and then my mom</B>
<P><B>made a comment that my grandfather had died exactly three years from

that</B>
<P><B>night.  Chills went up my back and  froze for a few seconds in shock.</B>
<P><B>	I have more true stories, but we will save them for another time.</B>

</H3><P><B>by lboone@cancom.net</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>I have always liked the idea of ghosts, but I never really believed
until my</B>
<P><B>pop died in early 1990. I was always close to my pop and would visit
him at</B>
<P><B>least every day; if not twice a day.  He died very suddenly in January

just</B>
<P><B>as  my family was about to move into a new house.</B>
<P>
<P><B>As I said we  are a close family and all my aunts and uncles came over

to</B>
<P><B>help us fix the house up. Since my pop helped with the weekly bingo
game  at</B>
<P><B>the legion.  He left suddenly and I didn't get to say good-bye.  Later

that</B>
<P><B>night after bingo, he died in the parking lot of the legion.  I didn't

find</B>
<P><B>out until the next day.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Now, My pop always said that he would see our new  house finished and

be</B>
<P><B>around to see all 13 grandkids married; he never got to see either.
 Well we</B>
<P><B>moved into the house and lived there for 3 years with no problem. 
then my</B>
<P><B>grandmother died and after that the footsteps started.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>I would be in bed late at night and hear someone walk  around the

kicthen</B>
<P><B>for a while then walk down the hallway to the bedrooms.  They would
stop at</B>
<P><B>each of the three bedrooms as if checking the rooms and then walk in
to the</B>
<P><B>closet and the steps disappears. This would happen at least once a
night at</B>
<P><B>2:25 the same time my nan died in the hospital, I know it is ny grand

father</B>
<P><B>looking for nan(she stayed with us for 2 year before she died).  Also
if you</B>
<P><B>are alone in the basement and noone is upstairs you can hear two

people</B>
<P><B>talking and walking around.  </B>
<P>
<P><B> Even now you sometimes get the smell of something baking(pop always

loved</B>
<P><B>our homemade treats) even if there is nothing baking in the house for

days.</B>
<P>
<P><B>When I asked my mother about the walking, she said she knew it was

pop</B>
<P><B>because when I was born he told her that he would always take care
of me</B>
<P><B>always; mom knows for a fact that he will keep his promise. I do to.</B>

<H3><A NAME="my parents house">My Parent's House</A>
</H3><P><B>by blkfox@vvm.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>Hi! My name is Polly and I have a few events I would like to share
with </B>
<P><B>you that happened in my parents house a few years ago. I need to give

</B>
<P><B>you a little background information about the house. It used to be
</B>
<P><B>a funeral home about seventy years ago. The enbalming happened in the

</B>
<P><B>basement, the bodies were veiwed on the first floor and the living
</B>
<P><B>quarters were on the second floor. There were two old ladies who use
to </B>
<P><B>own the place before my grandfather bought it. The ladies had an black

</B>
<P><B>man that worked for both of them. My mother told me that one of the
old </B>
<P><B>ladies died there. They were sisters.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Now here is my story. It first started with my oldest brother and one

</B>
<P><B>of his friends. They were playing on the first floor of the house when

</B>
<P><B>they heard footsteps come up the basement stairs. the footsteps came
up </B>
<P><B>the stairs the basement door that was located off the kitchen in the
</B>
<P><B>laundry room. The door was a sliding one. That made a lot of noise
when </B>
<P><B>you moved it. Well they were the only ones in the house. Our parents
</B>
<P><B>were at work. The door started to slide open and they got scared and

ran</B>
<P><B>to his friends house til our parents got home. My brother told my </B>
<P><B>parents what happened and they just said don't worry about it.</B>
<P>
<P><B>That was about 18 yrs ago. I am going to skip ahead a few years now.

My</B>
<P><B>Grandparents lived with us till a few years ago. Granddad was working

</B>
<P><B>and my grandma was relatives. They lived on the second floor. My brother

</B>
<P><B>and I wanted something from upstairs but did not want want to go up
</B>
<P><B>there. My said if we wanted it we had to go get it ourselves. So we

did.</B>
<P><B>There are stairs that lead to the second floor. The stairs are a

flight</B>
<P><B>of 13 steps. We walked up the stairs and went in the door on the

right.</B>
<P><B>When we went in the door the door to my grandmas room opened about
six </B>
<P><B>inches and slammed shut. There was nobody upstairs at that time. We
ran </B>
<P><B>down the stairs and told my parents what happened. They went upstairs

</B>
<P><B>and came back and told us nothing was upstairs. Then all of a

suddened</B>
<P><B>the door to the basement slid open and slammed shut. It got real cold</B>
<P><B>in their room and the footsteps on the basement stairs started up and

</B>
<P><B>lasted about 15 min. then stopped. I have a few more stories but I
tell </B>
<P><B>them at a later date. If you have any comments or stories you want
to </B>
<P><B>swap just email me at blkfox@vvm.com</B>

<H3><A NAME=encounters>Life Long Encounters</A>
</H3><P><B>by alexr@terrestrial.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>I guess I should start by saying that I'm not the first woman in my

family</B>
<P><B>to have paranormal experiences. All the women in my family,

matrilineally,</B>
<P><B>have have one experience or another. It's not so strange to us that
we would</B>
<P><B>also have ghostly experiences.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I grew up for the most part in a tract house in So. California. My</B>
<P><B>great-grandparents moved into the house in 1956 or so, when my mother
was a</B>
<P><B>toddler. In 1974, my great-grandfather was injured when a freight

elevator</B>
<P><B>door fell on him, paralyzing him. My Ma (my great-grandmother) told
me he</B>
<P><B>was very unhappy depending on her for everything and after teaching

himself</B>
<P><B>to walk, he sent her out of the house, walked to the closet, removed

his</B>
<P><B>shotgun, placed the end in his mouth, and pulled the trigger. He died
in the</B>
<P><B>doorway of the master bedroom.</B>
<P>
<P><B>My first ghostly encounter happened when I was nine. I was asleep in
my Ma's</B>
<P><B>bed in the master bedroom. I woke up about 2 or 3 in the morning to
hear my</B>
<P><B>Ma in the kitchen, puttering around. I looked up at the door to see
a very</B>
<P><B>distinct figure of a man peering aroung the doorframe at me. He was

about</B>
<P><B>six feet tall, with white hair and clothing. He was so clear that I

could</B>
<P><B>see his fingers curled around the doorframe and the white part of his</B>
<P><B>fingernails. I closed my eyes and slowly counted to ten. When I opened

my</B>
<P><B>eyes, the figure was gone. I thought I was dreaming and went back to

sleep.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The next night, I awoke about the same time to hear Ma in the kitchen</B>
<P><B>washing dishes. It was then I saw the figure in the doorway again.
This time</B>
<P><B>however, he began to approach me. I closed my eyes, shaking, only to

hear</B>
<P><B>the floor squeaking like someone was crossing the room. It stopped
at my</B>
<P><B>side of the bed and I felt a light brush against my cheek, like a kiss.

I</B>
<P><B>screamed and didn't stop screaming until Ma came running in.</B>
<P>
<P><B>As she calmed me down, I related the story of the past two nights.
She got</B>
<P><B>up and removed a shoebox of pictures from the closet. She took out

one</B>
<P><B>picture and showed it to me. "Is this who you saw?" It was, right down

to</B>
<P><B>the clothing. I began to shake as she told me that it was my</B>
<P><B>great-grandfather. The family thought it was my imagination when she

told</B>
<P><B>them, until they realized I had never seen that picture or heard the

story</B>
<P><B>of his death before. It was later told he had died in the spot that
I saw</B>
<P><B>him, one year before my birth. It was Ma's firm belief that he had
been sent</B>
<P><B>back to protect me. </B>
<P>
<P><B>As I got older, he began to affect things in the house, to show his</B>
<P><B>presence. Floors would squeak like someone was walking down the hall.

Doors</B>
<P><B>would open and shut. Cabinets open and shut. Chairs move. Objects

would</B>
<P><B>disappear and reappear in places you would never put them. But he was

never</B>
<P><B>seen by anyone in the family, except me.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I can remember one occasion, he trapped my mother in the kitchen by

moving</B>
<P><B>chairs and cabinet doors in her way. I stood frozen in the living room

and</B>
<P><B>watched until my mother in tears, cried out for him to stop and

identified</B>
<P><B>herself by his nickname for her. It stopped suddenly, as if he realized

who</B>
<P><B>it was he had terrified.</B>
<P>
<P><B>When I was fifteen, Ma got very ill and had to be taken to the hospital.

I,</B>
<P><B>too, was sick at the time with pnuemonia and confined to a bed in the

living</B>
<P><B>room. My grandfather got more active then. You could hear him pacing

the</B>
<P><B>hall at all hours. He would do things he had done in life, like walk

down</B>
<P><B>the hall to use the bathroom. (I'm probably the only person in the

world</B>
<P><B>whose ghost uses the toilet.) Several times, he walked out to check
on me. I</B>
<P><B>felt his presence as he came in ans sat down on my bed. I felt the
bed sink</B>
<P><B>with his weight and reached out to feel the sunken area, but there

was</B>
<P><B>nothing there but cold. I looked up to see and hear Ma's favorite music

box</B>
<P><B>begin to play on its own.</B>
<P><B>It got to the point where you could see and hear his path through the

house</B>
<P><B>as the front door opened, then shut, and footsteps though the house
to the</B>
<P><B>back door, which opened and then shut. Everyone who saw this all agreed

it</B>
<P><B>was as if someone had walked in, through, and out the house. For a
week, we</B>
<P><B>all lived in a state of anxiety. Then, the night Ma died, it stopped.

I</B>
<P><B>swear I could hear her voice in my head, berating him for scaring us

all.</B>
<P><B>After that, he was very quiet, appearing only sporadically.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I moved out two years ago, and my grandfather came with me. When I
told my</B>
<P><B>mother, she insisted I search my apartment for something that I might

have</B>
<P><B>inadvertently brought from the house. Nothing. While talking to my

mother</B>
<P><B>later on, she said she thinks that perhaps I am the object he has

attached</B>
<P><B>himself to. After I left home, he seemed to leave the house alone except

for</B>
<P><B>isolated incidents. But things happened in my apartment that I

couldn't</B>
<P><B>explain except that he was here doing them. My keys disappeared and
I fould</B>
<P><B>them in the freezer. My wallet would also disappear whenever I tried

to</B>
<P><B>leave the house, only to reappear behind the TV. Lately, he's taken

to</B>
<P><B>hiding my birth control pills (Is this a message?).</B>
<P>
<P><B>But still, I was the only one to see him until last year. My husband,

then</B>
<P><B>fiancee, got up in the middle of the night to get a drink of water.
I woke</B>
<P><B>just in time to see him jump back from the bedroom door, and he turned

to</B>
<P><B>he. "Holy S---! There's somebody in the living room." I got up with
him to</B>
<P><B>investigate and found no one. After he told me again exactly what he

had</B>
<P><B>seen, I told him who he had seen. If he didn't believe me before, he</B>
<P><B>believes me now.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Grandfather has even spooked (pardon the pun) my stepfather. I was

there</B>
<P><B>visiting,and he was lying on the couch, watching TV. He turned to my
mom and</B>
<P><B>asked for a blanket, saying he was cold. My mom and I looked at each

other,</B>
<P><B>since we both had said earier how hot we were. I got up and ran my

hand</B>
<P><B>through the air about 18 inches above his body. It was much colder.
I called</B>
<P><B>my mom over and she also said it was colder above him that the rest
of the</B>
<P><B>room. We asked him to sit up. He did, taking a seat on one end of the

couch.</B>
<P><B>As my mom and I stood there, we felt the cold spot move past us and

center</B>
<P><B>on the couch where he had been lying. I started laughing, since how

often</B>
<P><B>does a ghost wait patiently for you to scoot over and let him sit

down?</B>
<P>
<P><B>He's been pretty quiet lately, but every so often I feel like he's
here with me.</B>
<P><B>But, to this day, I will not sleep alone in that house.</B>

<H3><A NAME="unusual experiences">Unusual Experiences</A>
</H3><P><B>by tmax2@ix.netcom.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>The incidences that I am about to describe are probably nothing and
</B>
<P><B>probably have logical explanations.  Im sure someone with knowledge
in </B>
<P><B>the electrical field could come up with an explanation of why these
</B>
<P><B>events took place.  Anyways the happenings are of an interesting nature
</B>
<P><B>and are somewhat startling.  The events took place in a townhouse that
</B>
<P><B>I previously lived in for about 3 years.  On several occasions I would
</B>
<P><B>wake up in the middle of the night by the sound of my television set
</B>
<P><B>being turned on.  On one occassion I woke about 3am in the morning
for </B>
<P><B>some unkown reason.  I immediately layed back down again to fall back
</B>
<P><B>asleep again when the television set turned on.  This was different
</B>
<P><B>from the previous occasions because this time I witnesses the televison
</B>
<P><B>turn on and there was no way I could dismiss or pass it off with the
</B>
<P><B>explanation that I had mistakenly left it on before falling asleep.
Up </B>
<P><B>to this point I had told nobody about the incidences.  I was afraid
</B>
<P><B>they would think I was crazy.  Then about a year after all these things
</B>
<P><B>had happened a last and final incident happened.  It was about a month
</B>
<P><B>before I was to move out and relocate to another part of the state.
 It </B>
<P><B>was about 11pm and I was sitting on my bed watching televsion with
the </B>
<P><B>lights off.  My dog was also there with me asleep at the end of the
</B>
<P><B>bed.  All of the sudden a lamp in the corner of my room clicked on
and </B>
<P><B>adjusted itself to its full illumination.  My dog, which never pays
</B>
<P><B>attention to anything; stood up and began staring at the lamp for about
</B>
<P><B>5 minutes.  At this point I was so shaken up, I couldn't go near the
</B>
<P><B>lamp to turn it off.  I decided rather to leave it on all night and
</B>
<P><B>turned it off later the next morning.  The next morning I also felt
</B>
<P><B>that I had to tell someone, so I told my girlfriend.  She looked at
me </B>
<P><B>like I had made this up.  So I never told anyone else after that. 
Im </B>
<P><B>sure that there may be some kind of power surge in my room that could
</B>
<P><B>have caused these things to happen.  I'm not a firm believer in ghosts
</B>
<P><B>and spirits and I am kinda skeptical about stories that i have heard
in </B>
<P><B>the past.  I still am skeptical about what I saw, I cant believe that
</B>
<P><B>anything other than a logical explanation like a electrical surge </B>
<P><B>caused these things. But I known one thing is for certain. I did see
</B>
<P><B>these things happen in front of my own eyes. </B>

<H3><A NAME="the piano">Ghost at the Piano</A>
</H3><P><B>by raptor@ecis.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>I am a 46 year old woman who still remembers as if it was yesterday
the event </B>
<P><B>that petrified me at the age of 16.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I lived in Palos Verdes, California when I was 13 and 14.  During the
time we </B>
<P><B>lived there, I began going to a new school and making new friends.
I have </B>
<P><B>always had a kind heart and noticed a very lonely girl my age that
looked as </B>
<P><B>if she needed a friend. Marie was to become a good friend for those
2 years. </B>
<P><B>We only saw each other at school as she lived down the hill and up
the other </B>
<P><B>side...too far to visit for a junior high kid. But we were happy to
be </B>
<P><B>friends at school.</B>
<P>
<P><B>When I was almost 14, we moved back to Orange County.  A couple years
went </B>
<P><B>by. Marie and I had remained friends through the mail. In the summer
of 1966, </B>
<P><B>Marie invited me to come up and stay a week with her and her family
during </B>
<P><B>the summer. My mother and step-father drove me up on a Thursday afternoon.
I </B>
<P><B>was to stay until the following weekend.</B>
<P>
<P><B>As we drove up the hill and followed the written directions that Marie
had </B>
<P><B>sent us, we turned around a long drive and there stood the biggest
stucco </B>
<P><B>mansion I had ever seen! It was pink stucco, with a Spanish Villa
influence. </B>
<P><B>Very pretty! I did not realize that Marie's family was so well off.
 I </B>
<P><B>gathered up my small suitcase and asked if Mom was going to see me
up to the </B>
<P><B>door. Well, she and my step-dad were in a hurry to get back home. 
So I </B>
<P><B>kissed mom and watched them as they drove back down the long driveway.
</B>
<P>
<P><B>I walked up to the only door I saw from where I had been left off.
 I knocked </B>
<P><B>and waited. A minute later, a young girl opened the door. She greeted
me </B>
<P><B>warmly and said she was Marie's sister. Marie was out taking a driving
lesson </B>
<P><B>and would be back shortly.  "Please make yourself comfortable. I'll
show you </B>
<P><B>Marie's room and you can put your stuff away." She was very pleasant
and I </B>
<P><B>followed her out of the kitchen.  As we walked into the foyer area,
to the </B>
<P><B>left of me was a very large winding staircase.  It went up and around
and I </B>
<P><B>had never seen anything so elegant before in my life! She took me down
the </B>
<P><B>hallway after we climbed the stairs. Goodness...there must have been
15 </B>
<P><B>bedrooms up there! As it turned out, each bedroom opened out onto the
hall </B>
<P><B>and each bedroom had its own full bathroom.  We reached Marie's room
(about 3 </B>
<P><B>bedrooms down on the right) and I couldn't believe how large it was!
There </B>
<P><B>were 2 double beds in the room...you could look out the window into
the back </B>
<P><B>yard. To the left was a door leading to Marie's private bathroom. It
was all </B>
<P><B>done in aqua and pink tile...lots of space. A huge bathtub and lots
of sink </B>
<P><B>space and drawers. I was so overwhelmed by all of this..it was like
a castle </B>
<P><B>to me.  Marie's sister left me to finish some work she was doing in
the </B>
<P><B>kitchen. She told me to make myself at home. Explore the house if I
wanted </B>
<P><B>to. And then she left. I put my suitcase down and sat on the bed. Then
I </B>
<P><B>decided to go look around at this magnificent house. I walked back
down the </B>
<P><B>spiral staircase and found myself walking toward some stairs going
down. As I </B>
<P><B>approached the stairs, I realized that the stairs led down to a very
huge </B>
<P><B>formal living room. I stepped down to the bottom. The fireplace was
as tall </B>
<P><B>as I was (5"0") and I remember walking up to it to see if I could stand
in </B>
<P><B>it. To the right of the fireplace was a door...I looked in and found
it full </B>
<P><B>of board games, a pool table, various things to do. A game room. That
was </B>
<P><B>nice. I closed the door and looked behind and to the right of me. There
was a </B>
<P><B>beautiful black grand piano standing in the corner. It was flanked
on the </B>
<P><B>left side of it by the wall and long windows with formal curtains.
It was a </B>
<P><B>nice place for the piano as the day's sunlight would shine on your
sheet </B>
<P><B>music. And I thought the accoustics would be great. I had been taking
piano </B>
<P><B>lessons myself for about a year and was very impressed with the size
and </B>
<P><B>beauty of this grand piano. I looked around a little bit more and decided
to </B>
<P><B>go back up the stairs and find Marie's sister in the kitchen. As I
reached </B>
<P><B>the top of the stairs, I heard the most beautiful classical music playing.
I </B>
<P><B>stood on the landing and looked down into the living room. There, at
the </B>
<P><B>piano, was a young boy, maybe 13 or 14, playing this wonderful music.
 I </B>
<P><B>stood for a couple minutes and listened. He looked down at his hands
as he </B>
<P><B>played. He was in his own world and didn't seem to see that I was there.
I </B>
<P><B>knew that it probably wasn't a good idea to bother him, but I decided
to walk </B>
<P><B>back down the stairs and sit on the sofa and listen.  As I began walking
</B>
<P><B>down, he stopped playing. He looked right at me and stopped. I felt
so bad, I </B>
<P><B>didn't want to disturb him, and was about to say something when he
stood up, </B>
<P><B>looked at me, did a 90 degree turn and walked out of the room. I went
to </B>
<P><B>follow him, to tell him I was sorry for disturbing him...and when I
reached </B>
<P><B>the wall behind the piano, I realized that this young man had walked
straight </B>
<P><B>through an area that turned out to be a window that looked out over
the </B>
<P><B>garden...with about a 10 foot drop. This was a solid glass window.
No French </B>
<P><B>doors. No latch to open and jump. Just a solid glass window with formal
</B>
<P><B>curtains, just like the one to the left of the piano. At that moment,
the </B>
<P><B>hair stood up on the back of my neck as I realized I had not seen a
real </B>
<P><B>person at all.  I hurried over to the stairs, climbed up and rushed
back to </B>
<P><B>the kitchen. Marie's sister was there and I immediately asked her where
their </B>
<P><B>phone was. The house was older and had little alcove's throughout the
house </B>
<P><B>for phones. She led me to one outside the kitchen area. As I dialed
my phone </B>
<P><B>number Marie arrived home. The phone rang and rang. No one was home.
So </B>
<P><B>little time had passed that my Mom hadn't even gotten home yet! Marie
greeted </B>
<P><B>me and hugged me. She could tell that something was wrong...but I wasn't
</B>
<P><B>about to tell anyone what I had seen. We walked out and went to the
game room </B>
<P><B>to talk. I was so unnerved, I must have seemed like the guest from
hell! I </B>
<P><B>excused myself and went back to the phone...I had to get out of there!
There </B>
<P><B>was no way I was sleeping in this house. My mother finally picked up
the </B>
<P><B>phone and in so many words told me that she wasn't making another trip
today </B>
<P><B>to come and get me. I told her I was scared, that I'd seen something.
Well, </B>
<P><B>she thought I was silly. "I think it would be rude of you to leave.
Marie has </B>
<P><B>asked you to stay for a week. We will pick you up next Saturday." Well,
that </B>
<P><B>wasn't the answer that I wanted. I called my boyfriend and pleaded
with him </B>
<P><B>to come and get me. He had to work that night. GREAT! I was stuck,
scared and </B>
<P><B>ready to walk home on foot if need be. As it turned out, I didn't sleep
most </B>
<P><B>of the night. I was frightened beyond words. The next morning, my boyfriend
</B>
<P><B>did come and get me. Marie was confused as to why I was leaving. I
didn't </B>
<P><B>know what to tell her...in fact, I can't remember exactly what I did
say to </B>
