<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>When my husband and I were first dating and in college, I would
sometimes go</b>
<br><b>visit him at his parent's house in Rockville Centre, New York[Long
Island].</b>
<br><b>I would stay in his room and he would stay in the attic [referred
to by his</b>
<br><b>family as "the tower".&nbsp; His parent's house is a tudor that
is probably 50</b>
<br><b>years old or so.&nbsp; I have no idea what the history of the house/street
is and</b>
<br><b>although I would loke to know, based upon our experiences there,
I live in</b>
<br><b>PA, work full time, have a child and simply don't have the time.&nbsp;
Any ideas</b>
<br><b>would be appreciated.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Anyway, when I would stay in his room, I would ALWAYS wake up in
the middle</b>
<br><b>of the night, around 1:30-2:30, and "sense" a female presence in
the room.</b>
<br><b>I was always terribly frightened, although I don't think I had a
rational</b>
<br><b>reason to be afraid.&nbsp; I always kep my eyes closed and the covers
over my</b>
<br><b>head b/c I was so afraid.&nbsp; I never saw or heard anything.&nbsp;
I simply sensed a</b>
<br><b>female presence.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Well, it bothered me that this kept happeneing b/c I could never
sleep well</b>
<br><b>whenever I visited.&nbsp; The last time I recall sleeping in that
room I woke</b>
<br><b>up[as usual] around 1:30 or so and immediately sensed a female AND
a male</b>
<br><b>presence in the room.&nbsp; In fact, I sensed that the male and
female presences</b>
<br><b>were fighting, one on either side of the bed I was in.&nbsp; I was
SO afraid.</b>
<br><b>Again, I didn't see anything b/c I refused to look.&nbsp; Anyway,
I made a break</b>
<br><b>and ran for it straight to the tower, crying.&nbsp; I made my husband
[then</b>
<br><b>fiance] stay up all night with the light on.&nbsp; After I told
him the stories</b>
<br><b>that led up to the latest occurrence, he finally told me his own.&nbsp;
He said</b>
<br><b>that he used to wake up in the middle of the night and find himself
talking</b>
<br><b>to a woman who was sitting on the end of his bed.&nbsp; Sometimes,
she would</b>
<br><b>offer him ice cream and he would reach out for it, wake up fully,
no longer</b>
<br><b>see anyone there, and fall right back to sleep.&nbsp; He was never
afraid.&nbsp; He</b>
<br><b>admitted to being a little "spooked" by it.&nbsp; He said that after
he went away</b>
<br><b>for college, the visits didn't really happen too often when he came
back, so</b>
<br><b>after a while, upon reflection, he convinvced himself that they
were all</b>
<br><b>dreams and in his imagination.&nbsp; Even after I told him what
happened to me, I</b>
<br><b>don't think he really was convinced one way or the other.&nbsp;
In a way, neither</b>
<br><b>was I.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Then we had friends of ours come visit us at the house one weekend.&nbsp;
They</b>
<br><b>were married and stayed together in my then fiance's room.&nbsp;
They slept on</b>
<br><b>the trundle bed, with my girlfriend on the lower side and her husband
on the</b>
<br><b>higher part.&nbsp; I started off in his sister's room, right next
to his room</b>
<br><b>where our friends were, but I am just always freaked out sleeping
in that</b>
<br><b>house, so I went up to the tower, turned the light on and just started</b>
<br><b>chatting with my husband.&nbsp; It wasn't late when we started talking,
maybe</b>
<br><b>12:30 or so.&nbsp; A while later I heard this REALLY WIERD gutteral
[spelling?]</b>
<br><b>sound coming from downstairs, followed by urgent hushed talking.&nbsp;
I looked</b>
<br><b>at my watch and saw that it was about 1:30.&nbsp; I put it out of
my head and</b>
<br><b>tried to pay attention to what my then fiance was talking about
when I heard</b>
<br><b>it again.&nbsp; I asked my fiance if he heard it, too and he told
me that he did</b>
<br><b>but that our friends were probably just arguing or something.&nbsp;
I pointed out</b>
<br><b>that we had all gone to bed around 11 or 11:30 and that it would
be mighty</b>
<br><b>strange of them to wake up just to have an argument.&nbsp; Nonetheless,
we heard</b>
<br><b>the gutteral sound and hushed urgent whispering again and I looked
at him</b>
<br><b>and told him that we ought to go down and make sure they were OK.&nbsp;
He</b>
<br><b>agreed.</b><b></b>
<p><b>When we got down the stairs and turned to look into the room, the
door was</b>
<br><b>open and the light was one at that point.&nbsp; Our friends were
sitting on the</b>
<br><b>edge of the upper trundle, shaking, sheet white and crying.&nbsp;
These are 35</b>
<br><b>year old, normal people.&nbsp; They were crying and rocking back
and forth,</b>
<br><b>clutching each other.&nbsp; When they finally composed themselves
enough to</b>
<br><b>speak, the explained that they had gone to sleep, when my girlfriend
woke up</b>
<br><b>b/c her husband was over top of her, choking her, with this horrible,</b>
<br><b>distorted face that "almost wasn't his" with all his teeth showing
and he</b>
<br><b>was making this horrible, gutteral sound.&nbsp; She starting saying
over and over</b>
<br><b>in an urgent whisper "it's me.&nbsp; it's me.&nbsp; stop it, you're
hurting me.</b>
<br><b>honey, it's me."&nbsp; When he "snapped back", he was terrfied b/c
he felt as if</b>
<br><b>he had not been in control of his own body.&nbsp; When she told
him what he had</b>
<br><b>done, he went hysterical crying and was even more afraid.&nbsp;
Neither I nor my</b>
<br><b>husband ever slept in that room again.&nbsp; I think our friends
were the first</b>
<br><b>couple to stay in that room together since my husband's family moved
in in</b>
<br><b>the mid-1980s.&nbsp; These events happened in the early-mid 1990s.&nbsp;
Nothing else</b>
<br><b>has ever happened to us there, although I am still freaked out sleeping</b>
<br><b>there.</b><b></b>
<p><b>This past summer, my mother in law [whom we never told about any
of the</b>
<br><b>incidents] claimed that the tower light, which was on a motion sensor]</b>
<br><b>started turning on even thought no one had been near the tower.&nbsp;
We still</b>
<br><b>didn't say anything.&nbsp; In 1996, she had converted my husband's
old room to a</b>
<br><b>sitting room across from their bedroom.</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have always wanted to know what I experienced and why and what
happened to</b>
<br><b>our friends and my husband.&nbsp; Please tell me what you think
and why.&nbsp; If</b>
<br><b>there is any advice that you have, I would love to hear it.&nbsp;
Thank you.</b>

<p><b>HEllo my name is Kim and I would like to share my experience with
you. This happened a several months ago in the summer. I am only 15 now
so I was 14 when this happened. I was sleeping in my room one morning and
it was about 6:00 or 6:30 am in the morning. I was awaken by something
cold over my feet. It felt like someon w dropping cold water over my feet,
I really didn't pay no attention to it because I thought it was my brother(
who is 25 years old). I just kicked my feet and yelled "leave me alone!".
It still wouldn't stop so I kicked whatever it was really hard. All of
a sudden something was taking my toes and bending them all the way back!
I started freaking out and raised up in my bed. I seen nothing at all anywhere.
I was so freaked out and every since that day I will never sleep with my
feet out from under the covers again. Thanks for reading my story. Please
also read my story on page nine called " THE GOLDEN CHEST" please e-mail

<p><b>Strange Music and Voices</b>

<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Hello.&nbsp; My name is Lisa and I am 26.&nbsp; I just recently got
engaged and have</b>
<br><b>moved into a house with my intended.&nbsp; Since day one I have
felt abit</b>
<br><b>uncomfortable here.&nbsp; Both of us hear music and voices coming
from other</b>
<br><b>rooms. Usually they are mixed up together, but I do hear just the
voices.</b>
<br><b>You can't make them out to be male or female.&nbsp; You can't even
tell what they</b>
<br><b>are talking about.</b><b></b>
<p><b>I can say the bird is freaked out all the time and the dog barks
at something</b>
<br><b>that we cannot see.&nbsp; My cat, who use to be terrified to go
outside, will not</b>
<br><b>come into the house.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Only my sons glasses have been moved.&nbsp; If I leave them on the
table,</b>
<br><b>sometimes, they will not be there in the morning when we get up.&nbsp;
They</b>
<br><b>usually do appear exactly where I left them twenty minutes later.&nbsp;
Just in</b>
<br><b>time to get out the door and get him to school.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Some pictures have been taken but not developed yet.&nbsp; I'd like
to know if</b>
<br><b>having the cleansed will make things worse or better.&nbsp; We have
a friend who</b>
<br><b>can do it, but my concern is making things worse.</b>

<br><b>The Dancing Girl</b>

<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>A few years ago my friend Janet, and I visited our local cemetary.
Birch</b>
<br><b>hill cemetary is located on a large hill in Fairbanks, Alaska. We
walked</b>
<br><b>up the hill, and just before we reached the top, we knoticed a side</b>
<br><b>trail. We turned down the trail, and then stoped and began a</b>
<br><b>conversation. All of a sudden I felt very happy, and giddy, almost
like</b>
<br><b>a child on christmas morning. I looked up the trail and saw the
most</b>
<br><b>beautiful sight I've ever seen in my entire life. It was a ghost
of a</b>
<br><b>little girl I'd say 9 or 10, she was wearing a white dress with
a bib,</b>
<br><b>and puffy sleeves. I came down to just below her knees.She had two
dark</b>
<br><b>braids that laid over the bib, She was dancing and twirling around.
I</b>
<br><b>watched her with amazment, the more I watched the more she would
dance.</b>
<br><b>Then I reilized that&nbsp; I was ignoring my friend, and wondered
if I was</b>
<br><b>just imagining the little girl. I turned to my friend with a look
of</b>
<br><b>disbelivf, without having to say a word to her Janet said " Ya I
see the</b>
<br><b>little girl" Still not beliveing I muttered the one in the white
dress?</b>
<br><b>" Ya she's dancing and twirling around." We watched her for another</b>
<br><b>couple minutes, without saying a word. Then she stopped dancing
and just</b>
<br><b>looked at us with a big smile on her face. Asuming she wanted to</b>
<br><b>comunicate with us janet and I headed up the trail towrd her. The
closer</b>
<br><b>we got the more she fadded away, and when we got to were she was,

<br><b>The Ghosts that Follows Me</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: Maxburrito@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; I dont know whether this is a ghost or ghosts or what.&nbsp;
I have noticed</b>
<br><b>that every bedroom i have ever had in the four houses i have lived
in was</b>
<br><b>always the coldest.&nbsp; I have had encounters with a shadowy black
figure</b>
<br><b>staring at me from the foot of my bed.&nbsp; My closet door was
always popping</b>
<br><b>open. I could never go to sleep unless my neighbors porch light
went off (it</b>
<br><b>was daylight sensitive)and i could never get to sleep unless i was
completely</b>
<br><b>under the covers with only an opening for me to breathe.&nbsp; I
dont know if im</b>
<br><b>just an excessivly scared person, or if i attract things.&nbsp;
one night in</b>
<br><b>particular scared me.&nbsp; I believe i was dreaming or maybe sleepwalking.
I</b>
<br><b>remember someone or something trying to scare me and even though
i was scared</b>
<br><b>i remember distinctly sayin Im not scared of you.&nbsp; Before i
could say the</b>
<br><b>word you, a bright blinding light came from the china cabinet, and
i felt as</b>
<br><b>if i was unleashing something.&nbsp; I remember after that i had
a typical run of</b>
<br><b>the mill scary dream involving aliens (cocoon just came out in theaters)</b>
<br><b>frankenstien, and dracula.&nbsp; hey i was a little kid at the time.&nbsp;
I do</b>
<br><b>remember that the particular dream reoccured billions of times since
then, i</b>
<br><b>still have it some fifteen years later.&nbsp; I am afraid of the
china cabinet,</b>
<br><b>and Im afraid of the room it was in.&nbsp; My parents are renting
that house and i</b>
<br><b>babysit for the renters child.&nbsp; His bedroom is the front room,
my old room.</b>
<br><b>I refuse to go in there with him, as if something might harm him.&nbsp;
I am</b>
<br><b>deathly afraid of basements and if I have to go down there i race
back up the</b>
<br><b>stairs.&nbsp; all basements...even furnished ones that dont look
like typical</b>
<br><b>basements.&nbsp; It seems that creepy feelings follow me everywhere.&nbsp;
In the last</b>
<br><b>house i was in , i took two rolls of film taking pictures of my
cat in my</b>
<br><b>room, on both rolls, purchased on diffrent days at diffrent locations,
and</b>
<br><b>diffrent brands, there was&nbsp; a wierd purple or green cloud in
about a third of</b>
<br><b>the pictures.&nbsp; My photography teacher, who has been teaching
for 28 years,</b>
<br><b>couldnt explain it, and hes seen every kind of under and overexposed
kind of</b>
<br><b>film there is!!!!</b>
<br><b>another incident that stands out in my mind is walking through the
woods and</b>
<br><b>hearing the trees? whispering, all at once so i couldnt make it
out, but</b>
<br><b>definite whispering, and people would appear all of a sudden on
the path, and</b>
<br><b>when u turned around they would be gone.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; well I moved clear
across the states from massachusettes to nevada,</b>

<br><b>The Lonely Ghost Named Henry.</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: MLopez3936@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>About a year ago, we moved into this&nbsp; beautiful 2 story house
with 3 bedrooms</b>
<br><b>to living rooms, 3 bathrooms, ect. One night about 9 months ago,
we started</b>
<br><b>hearing activity coming from the stairs leading to the 1st floor.
We thought</b>
<br><b>it was the dog chasing the cats but about two days later was what
really was</b>
<br><b>spooky. One night then I was late doing my homework I heard this
sound like</b>
<br><b>footsteps going up and down the steps, the sound was soft like a
childrens</b>
<br><b>step, I got outta bed to look what the animals have done to eachother.
When I</b>
<br><b>went to the stairs I dident see anything, but I knew what I heard,
and the</b>
<br><b>animals were not even there. About a month later, my mom woke to
the noise of</b>
<br><b>tapping on the wall in my room, so my mom came in to find not even
me awake</b>
<br><b>at 2:00 in the morning, right then she heard the tapping noise like
a knock</b>
<br><b>of a little child but coming from my wall but nothing was in sight.
Bout a</b>
<br><b>week after that my mom was outside watering the lawn when suddenly
the wind</b>
<br><b>chime started to rattle and shake like a hurricane hit it but, my
mom</b>
<br><b>realised that there was no wind out and nothing was moving and the
chime was</b>
<br><b>still rattling. All about then nothing has been happening nothing
until' The</b>
<br><b>J.F.K incoddent happened, the ghost we call Henry is back, onother
night</b>
<br><b>around 7:00 my mother was folding clothes in her bedroom when suddenly
the</b>
<br><b>T.v. turned on by it'self and said John F. Kennedy has died in a
plane crash</b>
<br><b>and flashed off, then my mom ran out of the room in shock!! The
ghost hasent</b>
<br><b>came back for 1 month, until, my brother went into his room one
night to find</b>
<br><b>his phone handing from the ceiling fan just twirling like a farris
wheel. but</b>
<br><b>wasent it the next morining Alex (my brother) went into his bathrrom
and came</b>
<br><b>out suddenly, to find his swiss army knife laying 6 ft. away from
it's case</b>
<br><b>where he left it just 1 minute ago. I was a witness to all these
cases. The</b>
<br><b>next night I knocked on his door to see if he hade my homework sheet,
and</b>
<br><b>suddenly the door slamed in my face while Alex across the room looked
and</b>
<br><b>watched and said what the H*** was that? Mystery maybe but, seeing
a ghost is</b>
<br><b>amazing! The ghostly figure was alittle boy around 8-10 small in
a uniform</b>
<br><b>nothing special liked to laugh becuz one night i rose to see who
was climbing</b>
<br><b>up the steps to see this boy who we called henry for no reason!
And I think</b>
<br><b>we are special to have a wonderful guest in our house!</b>

<br><b>Three Experiences</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>BY: Garmarsail@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>My first experience occurred when I was about 14 years old.&nbsp;
I was walking to</b>
<br><b>my girlfriends house.&nbsp; It was a beautiful (late summer) night,
there was</b>
<br><b>absolutely no wind (not even a slight breeze) - this occurred after
dark and</b>
<br><b>the street lights were on.&nbsp; There were street lights at each
end of the</b>
<br><b>block.&nbsp; The street was also lined with moderate sized trees
on the parking on</b>
<br><b>both sides of the street.&nbsp; There was no foot or car traffic.&nbsp;
Now that I have</b>
<br><b>described the mood of the night, I will proceed with my story.</b><b></b>
<p><b>When I got to just about the middle of the block, I glanced across
the street</b>
<br><b>and saw something moving erratically just below the tree limbs on
the street</b>
<br><b>side of the trees and as I walked, it moved right along with me.&nbsp;
If I sped</b>
<br><b>up, it sped up with me and if I slowed down, so did it.&nbsp; Also,
it was solid</b>
<br><b>(not transparent).&nbsp; When I realized that I didn't know what
it was, I got</b>
<br><b>scared and started to run, all the while it moved with me, then
out of the</b>
<br><b>clear blue - it just disappeared.&nbsp; I stood there for the longest
time trying</b>
<br><b>to gather enough courage to investigate further, which I finally
did.</b><b></b>
<p><b>I walked across the street and looked "everywhere" for anything that
it could</b>
<br><b>have been and found absolutely nothing.&nbsp; Nothing in the street,
nothing on</b>
<br><b>the parking, nothing in peoples yards, plus there was absolutely
"NO" wind</b>
<br><b>(not even a breeze), so whatever it had been would have had to have
still</b>
<br><b>been there.&nbsp; Also, why did it just disappear?&nbsp; I am now
60 years old and I</b>
<br><b>have never seen a report about what I saw.&nbsp; Your site gave
me the opportunity</b>
<br><b>to talk to someone who might give me a logical explanation of what
I saw.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>can still see it in my minds eye.</b><b></b>
<p><b>What I saw was about 14" in diameter, was square, and was completely
white.</b>
<br><b>It slowly moved right along with me, and also moved up and down
(more like</b>
<br><b>floated) and while it did this, it also moved in and out (the sides
moved in</b>
<br><b>and out, and the top and bottom moved in and out) .</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ___</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; l&nbsp;&nbsp; l&nbsp;
the sides moved in and out (flowed or fluttered in and out)</b>
<br><b>and the top and bottom moved up and down (flowed or fluttered up
and down),</b>
<br><b>but in flowing or fluttering motions (not rigid).</b><b></b>
<p><b>If you can explain what I might have seen, I'm sure it would clear
up 46</b>
<br><b>years of wondering.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Also, I had two other experiences that I cannot explain, as follows:</b><b></b>
<p><b>1.&nbsp; My husband and I were having problems (drinking and other
women) and</b>
<br><b>being a homebody, I was home by myself a lot.&nbsp; During this
time and until I</b>
<br><b>remarried 5-1/2 years later, I used to periodically see a "Buccaneer"
in the</b>
<br><b>hallway in front of the office doorway, just to the west of my living
room.</b>
<br><b>He was quite handsome, was in color, about 5'10", had long wavy
medium brown</b>
<br><b>hair, a wavy mustache and beard, beautiful clothes (he wore a gold
brocade</b>
<br><b>jacket and pants, white ruffled shirt with ruffles at the cuffs,
long shiny</b>
<br><b>black boots, and a gold hat with a long white feather plume).&nbsp;
He was always</b>
<br><b>leaning on his sword (sword was on the right side) with one leg
cocked over</b>
<br><b>the other with his left toe resting just to the right of his right
foot.&nbsp; He</b>
<br><b>never said a word and never stayed long, but being alone, I got
the feeling</b>
<br><b>he was there to help me feel safe.&nbsp; I was never afraid of him.&nbsp;
In fact he</b>
<br><b>gave me a good feeling.&nbsp; Just prior to marrying my second husband
he never</b>
<br><b>appeared again, although I can still feel his presence sometimes.</b><b></b>
<p><b>2.&nbsp; This occurred after my divorce and prior to my remarriage.&nbsp;
One day I was</b>
<br><b>working in my yard.&nbsp; I was on my way to the garage from the
back yard and I</b>
<br><b>recall I had my head down (I was on a mission and ready to run over
anyone</b>
<br><b>who was in my path).&nbsp; As I set foot on the patio and was turning
toward the</b>
<br><b>garage I saw a beautiful vision.&nbsp; In fact she startled me and
I threw up my</b>
<br><b>hands and gasped because I almost ran into her.&nbsp; She was "beautiful".&nbsp;
Having</b>
<br><b>my head down, I saw her from her feet on up to her head.&nbsp; She
was barefoot,</b>
<br><b>had a red rose on both of her feet, her skin was flawless, she wore
the</b>
<br><b>whitest robe I have ever seen (it almost blinded me), her hands
were in front</b>
<br><b>of her as if to take hold of mine, and she had the softest most
gentle</b>
<br><b>features of any woman I have ever seen.&nbsp; Her eyes were blue
and you could see</b>
<br><b>just a hint of dark brown hair under the robe that covered her head.&nbsp;
When I</b>
<br><b>gasped she disappeared, but I will never forget what I saw.&nbsp;
By the way I am</b>
<br><b>a Christian, I am not Catholic, so do not pray to Mary.&nbsp; All
of my prayers</b>
<br><b>are directed to God through the Son as the bible instructs.&nbsp;
I have no idea</b>
<br><b>why she was there, as she didn't say a word.&nbsp; This has puzzled
me over the</b>
<br><b>years and would like to receive an explanation if you can give me
one.</b><b></b>
<p><b>If you can explain what I saw and why I would be forever grateful.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Thank you for your time and consideration.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Unwanted Company</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By:j777@netusa1.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>My name is Andy, and the haunting that i am describing took place
in the house that i was born and raised in . The house is in Elwood , In.
The hauntings began after my mother and father passed on. They started
in 1989 , the same year my mother had died of emphyzema. Wierd things started
happening like vcr tapes sitting on top of my console television "slid"
straight out from the tv and dropped to the floor. Another time i had a
couple of guys over to play euchre after work (midnight) and i had my stereo
on in the living room playing a cd. When during the course of the euchre
game the stereo just "stopped" playing, i went to investigate and noticed
that the pause symbols were on my cd player. anyone who knows about stereo
equipment knows that if the cd skipped , "pause" does not come on. This
happened&nbsp; at least four times before i had&nbsp; had enough and just
shut it off completely. The one you've been waiting for... Sometimes when
i would walk around my garage after dark i could feel eyes watching me
from the upstairs window. So i and some friends went to investigate one
evening. I walked upstairs and immediately felt a presence, a strong presence
that i was not welcome upstairs in my garage, at all. My garage windows
are on the north and south ends of the garage, one friend said he didn't
feel anything wierd so he kept on exploring the upstairs. Mind you i was
still at the top landing not yet fully upstairs and in no hurry to get
there. I looked at my friend who was exploring near the north window and
i sensed a very strong presence right beside him,( but didn't say anything
to him because he was a skeptic and probably would'nt believe in ghosts
if one stared right in his face). So i turned to my now ex-wife and asked
her if she sensed anything spirit wise upstairs and she agreed that there
definately was a ghost present. I asked her where she thought the presence
was coming from and she said to me right where i had thought it was...
right next to where my friend was standing. So i finally got brave enough
to complete my trek upstairs and i stood at the top of the stairs mooving
away from the edge to let a couple of people by , (my ex, and another friend).
I was trying to keep them quiet so i could concentrate on the presence
when all of a sudden i felt another presence, this one about ten feet in
front of me. I sat down on a box that i had near the stairs and had another
friend sit next to me on another box about three feet away. Still concentrating
on the now two spirits, one came out of nowhere right between the two other
spirits that i had been concentrating on and i felt it grab me by the throat
and hold me to the wall of the garage tightly but not choking, just enough
to let me know it was there. After about ten minutes "it" finally let go
of my neck , i stood up and started to go back downstairs completely distrought
i felt it come up form behind me like it was going to push me down the
stairs so i stepped back and insisted that a friend of mine walk down behind
me. Nobody else got bothered by the spirits and they did say that they
did "feel" something up there, what it was , or who it was is unknown but
the third unexpected spirit was definately evil to say the least. This
story is very true and i do have witnesses to the fact . Thank you for
you time.</b>

<p><b>Iowa Rental Home</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By: ImChrissy@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp; We just moved into a small rental home in Eastern Iowa last
Dec.&nbsp; Ever</b>
<br><b>since we have been here my 3 year old son has had very strange dreams
and I</b>
<br><b>have had even stranger feelings.&nbsp; When my son sleeps in his
room (which he</b>
<br><b>hardly ever does anymore) he always has a "nightmare" and comes
running into</b>
<br><b>my room, which is right next to his.&nbsp; In the morning he explains
these</b>
<br><b>"dreams" to me, very rationally and calmly.&nbsp; He tells me about
dark shadows</b>
<br><b>sitting at the end of his bed or coming out of the closets.&nbsp;
One particular</b>
<br><b>evening I was laying in bed with my daughter who was about 12m old
at the</b>
<br><b>time, my husband was out of town.&nbsp; Everytime I closed my eyes
I could swear I</b>
<br><b>heard children laughing.&nbsp; I checked outside several times and
could not find</b>
<br><b>anyone out.&nbsp; Finally I ignored it and fell asleep.&nbsp; The
next morning my son</b>
<br><b>told me when he came into my room that night he saw 2 kids running
across the</b>
<br><b>wall, but they were black like a shadow.&nbsp;&nbsp; Since then
I have heard voices and</b>
<br><b>seen shadows out of the corner of my eye.&nbsp; Sometimes the room
will get very</b>
<br><b>cold or have an odd smell.&nbsp;&nbsp; My son now sleeps on the
couch in the family</b>
<br><b>room and has only once reported a monster shadow emerging from the
mirror in</b>
<br><b>the coat closet door.&nbsp; The strange thing is he really doesn't
seem to be</b>
<br><b>frightened.&nbsp; I have to admit there are times when I certainly
am.&nbsp; We don't</b>
<br><b>know any history of the house or the people who owned it before
our landlord,</b>
<br><b>but I am trying to get some information and If I do I will write
a follow up.</b>
