<P><B>&nbsp;Believer out of Me</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: sandis@caamanitoba.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>My husband and I had gone to a friends house to pick up musical unstruments
and equipment to take to a show for later that day.&nbsp; When we arrived
I was dismayed that Debbie (the wife of the couple) had just left to take
their 2 sons to a wrestling match at the local arena.&nbsp; So I sauntered
downstairs with my husband Matt and Donnie (husband of the couple).&nbsp;
The house was very very quiet (and as a coincidence it looks alot like
the amytiville horror house), so every sound was heard clearly.</B>
<BR><B>After about 10 minutes I heard Debbie clearing the table (it had
been full of lunch dishes).&nbsp; I asked if she could be home and was
told no.&nbsp; Matt and Donnie kept asking me what was wrong...I had a
strange look on my face.&nbsp; I did not want to say anything because they
would think I was crazy.&nbsp; I finally told them what I heard, and could
still hear as we spoke.&nbsp; At this point Donnie asked me if I had ever
heard about the lady who had once lived there.&nbsp; I hadn't.&nbsp; Matt
had heard the story before so he could confirm the story was true.</B>
<BR><B>The prevous owner of the home was a lady in her 60's.&nbsp; She
had apparently had a heartattack while doing dishes and died on the spot.&nbsp;
Donnie said he had never seen a person loose all color in their face so
fast.&nbsp; Matt had gone to check and no one was upstairs.&nbsp; I heard
it until we left the house that day.&nbsp; I have not heard it since.</B>
<BR><B>There have been other incidents in the house however.&nbsp; When
they first moved in Deb and Don had about 30 glass glasses.&nbsp; By the
end of the first month they had none.&nbsp; Glasses would crack and break
while sitting in the cupboard or on the table.&nbsp; No reason. Another
time Debbie was doing dishes, the kids outside and Don downstairs.&nbsp;
Deb felt a cold hand gram her ankle.&nbsp; Knowing her husband is a joker
she assumed it was him.&nbsp; When she looked down, there was no one there.</B>
<BR><B>It has sure made a believer out of me.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>The Land</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: mandylee@brightok.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hi first off i would like to say i love your site. and i decided
to share mine and my famlies experience. At the time I was very young and
rember some but alot of it was told to me by my grandmother and uncle.
It all started when my granmother and her x-husband bought some land witch
now highway412 runs trow from the Oklahoma border into Silome springs Arkansas.
When it the land was bought it was nothing but tress so my famlie all got
to geather and help them clear a spot out to put up a trayler. the trayler
deep in the woods with a road that was little mor than a path no big vehicles
could drive down the path just little cars. the weierd stuff started to
happen when thay brouht the animals out there wich was a pet goat of my
younger uncle with was and about 4 hunting dogs and one gaurd dog every
thing ws fine entell the dogs started to end up missing and when we did
find them the only thing that was left of them was ther heads we could
not find nothing of the rest of there bodys not even a bone we a first
thought it was a wild animal so when my grandmothers husband came home
(he drove a truck at the time and would be gone weeks at a time) he put
up a hight fince to protect to other animals wich at this time the ony
onesd left was the goat and gard dog. and then he,my step-dad,and oldest
uncle whent hunting for what thay belived to be a wild cat and found nothing
that same night thay came back around dark we had dinner i was staying
the night with my granmother playing with my uncle who is sevral monthes
younger than me when my grandmother had to walk down the every long road
to her husband truck because he was about to go on the road agan and ahd
to park the truck and walk about 11/2 miles to get to the trayler(if you
recall earler I exsplaend about how small the road was)well my grandmother
had taken the garddog had said her good bys to him and was on her was back
when the dog started to act funny he would go to the woods(the drive way
ran right trow the middle of the woods if you were lucky to have a car
small anuff to dive it you could dive down the wood in the middle of the
day and it would seem night the trees were that thick as i rember)stop
about half way ther bark and growl but would never go near the trees then
sudanly her ran off with his tail between his legs crying wich was amazing
this dog was a gard dog bred and rased to fear nothing and had so many
scars on him from fighting with wild animlas even a bob cat with almost
killed him but he stell fought.anywho he ran off living my gandmother in
the woods scared at what she heard in the wood chasing the dog as it ran
she seen nothing but heard cleary somthing so big take after the dog it
litterly ran over small trees braking them off at the trunks well from
what she tolt me she ran all the way back home fast as she had ever ran
her being a big woman and told my step dad what happen well he took the
shot gun and when looking for the dog and found nothing and told my grandmother
and mother he was never going back out in the woods at night agen he said
somthing folwed he the whole time but never got to close well the next
day my uncle came over and we discoverd the fince thay put up only a day
ago had been ripped up from the ground and the goad was missing well later
that day thay found both dog and goat (diffrent playies) agan nothing left
but the head well my grandmother had had enuff cald the cops who in turn
called the talsa zoo who came out to see if it was the panter that had
ranaway from the zoo when my grandmother told thim how nothin but the heads
were left thay told her that cats of any size would not eat the bones might
chew on thim but not eat thim and when thay did a sweep of the land found
no sighe of the panther or any other wild life at htat but birds no caves
fore a bob cat or any large cat at that to stay in he thay said the only
thing that could rip a anmals head off( when thay looked at the head of
the dog and goat thay told us the neck was broken and the head was ripped
of like a rag doll) was a bear but not like that and ther was no bear in
that part so thay left with nothing my grandmother sold the place and a
couple of weeks later the panther was found where at I have know idea but
not nere us the lan never had any one eles to live on it finally it was
bought by the state and thay cleard out all the trees and now highway412
runs almost right wher the trayler use to sit says my grandmother what
was it attacing our animal i dont know some say bigfoot(we was not the
only ones that has had animals killed) but i really dont cair to find out
to this day you will hear a farmer coment on how some of his live stock
is found with nothing but a head and i just smile and walk away not saying
a word about the land</B><B></B>

<P><B>My Experiences Continue</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: kinerfled@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hello my name is Ian im an 18 yr old male from Ontario, Canada and
i wrote hear about 3 yrs ago and got my story posted it goes under the
name My Personal Experience With Ghosts... By the way thanks for posting
it :)</B>
<BR><B>As i said at the end of my story i am now living in a house this
Decemember will be 8 yrs the house is a new house i have seen it being
build so no one has previously lived in here before... but i have encounterd
spirits&nbsp; I think i am what you would call a sensative person sensative
to see such things...</B>
<BR><B>Well when we first moved here there was all sorts of weird noises
and my parents told us not to worry about it it's just the house setteling
it seems houses always settle when their new when their old but anywayz
it usally was the house making the noises... But some of the noises sometimes
would make me think otherwise.</B>
<BR><B>This is a fairly big house compared to where i use to live in that
aparment 4 Bedroom 3 Washroom living room dining room thats in one bigger
kitchen Basement you get the idea.</B>
<BR><B>Anywayz when we first moved here i had my room at the end of the
hall right by the staircase. It was summertime i think. my sisters room
was right next to my room in the corner then there is a small storage closet
then there is another room which was the playroom then but it now my room
then a fairly big space then the washroom and after the washroom in the
far corner in the other side of the hall was my parents room. the biggest
of all 4 rooms if i was lying in bed in the night and put my ear to the
wall i could hear what my parents were saying even though it was on the
other end of the hall because behind that wall was my parents room&nbsp;
just giving a description sorry anyways back to the story.</B>
<BR><B>Some nights i would get up to go use the washroom and i would hear
like someone was running around downstairs i was 12 at this time so i was
still a little scared of the things that go bump in the night&nbsp; i could
swear it sounded like someone was running around the the kitchen out into
the hall into the living room and dining room which is connected makes
it a big room then back in the kitchen out into the hall and so forth and
i could tell what running sounded like cause me and my lil sister always
use to run around like that even though we were told repeated times not
to.</B>
<BR><B>I would just usally ignore it and it would stop but it would happen
each night one night i got really curious and even though i was scared
decided to go downstairs and check things out nothing was there of course
and it stoped when i was down there but as soon as i went back in my room
i would hear it again... i just ignored it it stoped after awhile.</B>
<BR><B>I told myself it was just the house setteling. about a yr or 2 later
my sister told me she use to hear it 2 and she said it sounded exactly
like what i described somebody running around i have also heard footsteps
coming up the stairs on rare occasions..</B>
<BR><B>Anyways about the time i was 13 i moved into the playroom it was
no my room and this room im in right now that was my room is now the playroom..</B>
<BR><B>I will tell you about an experince that scared me now.. My uncle
was over we had just spent a day in Toronto we went to show him the CN
Tower since he had never been there before.</B>
<BR><B>Anywayz when we came back home we didn't really feel like sleeping
so we stayed up and i showed my uncle a horror movie Evil Dead 2 dead by
dawn he found it quite amusing. Anyways after the movie was done evryone
went up and i was down there rewinding it lying in the dark i was older
now i wasn't afraid of being downstairs alone in the dark after i had just
watched a horror movie anyways it was finish i took it out went upstairs
turned on my raido and layed down in my bed it was a really Hot summers
night about 2 am it was.. Anyways i lay there listening to my raido sleep
not coming it was already after 4 the last time i looked at my clock it
read 4:30 something i was still wide awake lying there then the covers
were pushed off me at the way end of the bed since it was so hot but all
of a sudden i felt a really cold air in the room i got goosebumps all over
i tryed to reach for my covers but realized i was frozen i couldn't move
by this time i thought it was sleeping paralysis i have read just about
evrything on sleeping paralysis since i have been experincing the stuff
since i was a little kid and i just wanted to say to evryone that the things
you may hear or see during your experince are just hallucinations and don't
be scared of them i use to try to struggle to break free and always did
but one night i decided to stay in forzen mode not try to break out see
what happens and nothing did happen i felt like something was there watching
me for a short while then i fell asleep one time it happend to me and i
saw all these colors sorta flying at the back of me i thought how relaxing
and fell right back asleep it's ethier you fall asleep or wake up which
i have done both once again i have overcome my fears :) so thats to any
of you that experince SP don't be afraid hallucinations can't hurt you
and something else i have learned from sleeping paralysis when your in
it and you relax yourself you can enter a lucid dream phase if you are
lucky but if you feel it is actually something for real then you panic
and struggle:D maybe not panic but certainly try to regain control of the
sitiutation.</B>
<BR><B>Anyways back to my story this might sound a bit hipocritical of
what i just said but i was trying to break free only after i saw something
come through my door it made a pop sound when it came through the door
i can only describe this thing as a faceless colorful form it had no feet
it was floating in mid hear somehow i can tell it was looking at me staring
at me even. by this time i was real scared so started struggling it said
A thousand years ago in a big deep voice but it said it telepathically
by this time i was frekead it was going to say more but i broke out of
the frozeness in time.</B>
<BR><B>all of a sudden the night heat came back and my radio was back on
i forgot to metion during this expeince i couldn't hear my raido...</B>
<BR><B>I do not believe this was sleeping Paralysis why number 1 reason
i was not sleepy at all and im not bullshiting you.</B>
<BR><B>You have to be sleepy to enter sleeping paralysis and i wasn't at
all Number 2 the coldness i felt during this experince was almost unreal
like i was about to die or something yes i understand when we are scared
we can get cold but this feeling was like Ice Cold like something was there
other than my own fear causing this&nbsp; I have also talked to a member
of the shadowland staff on here and he told me he does believe it was a
spirit because of the coldness and 3 the raido was on why would i not hear
it anymore if i was just frozen i can understand being sleepy and drifting
off would certainly make one not hear it but i was not as i repeat again
not sleepy at all i wouldn't lie about this now a soon as the thing left
i feel it left cause i pushed it away i heard the raido and now tell me
where the coldness went thats number 4 heat arrived so quickly afterwards
if you are scared after a scary dream when you awake you are shivering
for awhile after the event even though you might be sweating but i felt
the summer heat right away as if someone had turned on a cold switch then
someone turned on a hot switch right after ohhh yeah and i tried to call
for my dad when i was still frozen but i could brealy speak...</B>
<BR><B>I felt stupid afterwards me being 13 and all trying to call for
my dad good thing nothing came out after the event i wasn't scared at all
i just though woah what and experince and was kinda dissapointed that i
drove the thing away because i wanted to hear the rest of what it wanted
to tell me but during the experince i was really scared thats why i sturggled.</B>
<BR><B>Anywayz i have a firm belif that this was a spirit.</B>
<BR><B>Anyways through out the years i have heard things especially when
im alone in the house i have seen things out of the corner of my eyes many
times. i always walk around in the dark now i don't know why but i do so
i am well familar with surroundings of the house and my eyes are well familar
to the dark hell ill just say it i like the dark being in the dark what
not anyways if anyone else was to come down in the dark and stand there
i would notice and could tell who it was right away. one night after watching
tv i proceeded to go upstairs but before i made my way up i looked into
the kitchen and saw a kind of red misty light sorta anyways i knew it was
a spirit evil or what i didn't know so i didn't wanna mess with it so i
just went upstairs and went to my bed. i was kinda sleepy this night i
won't deny it it this actually happend January 25 of this yr 2003 anyways
i close my eyes and see a big bright flash of light and open my eyes and
think that couldn't be a car from across the street because the light was
way too bright and it was blue way 2 blue to be a car light. so my next
thought was lightning i thought it was kinda weird since it was the middle
of winter and you don't usally see lighting in the middle of winter in
Ontario , Canada but it does happen sometimes so i just blew it off as
lighting thinking not much about it i closed my eyes again and then opend
them and was just lying there then all of a sudden i realized i was frozen
then i started to hear all these voices talking at once i couldn't make
out what they were saying it sound like the voices were coming from in
all the walls like the walls were talking then out of the side of my eye
i see this form this real bright blue light come to shape since i was frozen
i couldn't turn my head to get a good look at it the blue light was almost
blinding at first i just thought this was paralysis and i was having a
hallucination but then all of a sudden a feeling of dred of danger a feeling
that this thing wanted to hurt me came over me then i finally made out
something the voices behind the walls were saying in this evil voice the
thing said we fianlly got him i felt pressure on my body like i was being
pushed down or something i started to struggle then it was all gone and
i could move again i jumped out of my bed right away and was scared and
because i knew it wasn't paralysis it was something trying to get me i
have been having paralysis episodes since i was a little kid and have slept
through them as i said but this just felt wrong this felt totally evil
i believe there are many forces in this life we don't know about some are
good and some are evil but what really convinced me that it was not an
SP episode was not all of what i talked about it was my eyes about 10 mins
after they left i still felt my eyes were hurting from the really bright
light now if this was a hallucination or delusion or whatever you want
to call it once it was gone or even when it was there it couldn't cause
phyical pain cause correct me if im wrong a hallucination is when you take
something and see things that aren't really there therefore if it's not
really there it can't hurt you like if you were munching on shroomz and
saw a troll running around and tried to touch it im not sure you would
feel it becuase it's a hallucination meaning not real fabrication of the
brain but i felt pain from the light about 10 mins after thats what made
me belive that it was indeed something.</B>
<BR><B>Personally i don't believe my house is haunted but i believe i am
like a gateway to the supernatrual i talk to them now people that hear
me would think im krazy but i don't kare i let them know i want to be their
friends not out to hurt them in my first story that got posted on here
My Personal Experinces Whith Ghosts i talked about how i would have this
dream of this lady that i have never seen before in my life just all of
a sudden one day dream her up and keep dreaming her for years and then
i finally told her to go away now that i think of it i feel bad for what
i have done sure i was scared of her but maybe she was just looking for
a friend and i pushed her away i just hope she is at peace now.</B>
<BR><B>As for evil i myself have communicated with them im always curious
about both sides of life the good and the evil so i think thats why they
communicate with me.</B>
<BR><B>well there is one more experince i would like to talk about but
i won't since i know i already took up 2 much space it has to do with a
demon anyone want to findout about it or anything else please email me
at kinerfled@yahoo.com</B>

<BR><B>Haunted Place in Las Vegas</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>By: KKula@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I have several stories about the ghosts of Las Vegas, but I share
one top story with you....</B>
<BR><B>When my parents and I moved to LV from Cleveland, Ohio a few years
ago, I did not notice anything at all until I met my psychic friend.</B>
<BR><B>He made my eyes open and helped me understand about LV culture (I
was cultural shocker).</B>
<BR><B>Anyway, we discussed about spiritualism, ghosts, and hauntings.</B>
<BR><B>Speaking of my house where my parents are still living, I started
to hear music little by little, see some flashes in my home.&nbsp; I did
not understand at that time.&nbsp; I told my friend about it and invited
him to my house for exploring.&nbsp; As we learned about past history behind
my house, four Navajo Indian ghosts used to live on their land where my
house is now established and one Irish lady named Josephine was murdered
by her husband on same spot.&nbsp; They were harmless and friendly.</B>
<BR><B>My house is on the middle of twenty miles of Crying Wolf trail where
Navajo Indians were forced to walk miles and miles during the war years
ago.&nbsp; I knew that City of LV does not have any records of that event
at all because Indians had been around long long long before LV become
city in 1905.</B>
<BR><B>Anyway, Josephine screamed for help which I could not see or hear
at all, but she asked me and my friend for some help to release her from
hell directly to heaven.&nbsp; We agreed to send her into the portal and
she finally went home.&nbsp; Josephine had to avoid the demon next behind
my house.&nbsp; The house is behind my home is evil because we have seen
the strange blue flashes.&nbsp; Later, two Indians found their ways to
the heaven.</B>
<BR><B>Before I moved to SF,&nbsp; last two Indians asked us to send them
through the portal and we did.&nbsp; Now, they rejoined with their beloved
families in the heaven.</B>

<BR><B>My Sisters Haunting</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Kathleen.Anderson@ntcmn.edu</B><B></B>

<P><B>Ever since we were very young, my sister and I had believed in ghosts.
Although we had never had any experience with it in our home (it was brand
new when our parents bought it) we would read numerous books on the subject.
Any way, we grew up, my sister got married and she moved with her husband
and three year old girl to a small town near the Canadian border where
her husband had grown up.</B>
<BR><B>For a while, they moved from rented house to rented house. After
they found out that my sister was pregnant again, they rented a house that
used to be owned by a good friend of her husbands.&nbsp; Apparently in
grade school, the two boys would have sleepovers at this particular house,
but my sisters husband would never stay in the boys room because something
about the closet scared him. Dismissing this as a young childs imagination,
they moved their child into that bedroom. Almost immediately, my neice
started having nightmares, and she insisted on having the poster on the
closet door taken down and put face down on the floor. At first I thought
that somehow the picture on the poster maybe frightened her in the dark
room, but she had had the poster up in all of the other places they lived
with no problem.&nbsp; Despite this, nothing really strange happened until
the baby was born.</B>
<BR><B>One day soon after my sister came home from the hospital with her
new baby girl, she was home alone with the baby. As it was winter, the
house was all closed up.&nbsp; She was rocking her baby to sleep when she
started to hear some lullaby music, only this wasn't regular music; it
was somehow sinister and scary and it was comeing from upstairs.&nbsp;
When she went to investigate, the music stopped, and the source was never
found.&nbsp; This would happen numerous times throughout the rest of the
time they lived there.&nbsp; The strange thing about it was that only my
sister and the children seemed to be able to hear it at first.&nbsp; As
if this wasn't freaky enough, one night during a midnight feeding in the
babys room, my sister heard someone say "hello" to her.&nbsp; At this time
everyone else in the house was in bed, so she knew it couldn't be any person.
But she felt a presence, and it seemed to be growing stronger.&nbsp; It
said "hello" again, and she shut her eyes tight and started to pray until
she felt the presence leave.</B>
<BR><B>Eventually she told our uncle, who is a very strong Christian and
has studied this kind of thing. He told her that she was right in not responding
to the spirit, as that would only have made it stronger. He suggested some
bible passages to read throughout the house that should get rid of any
spitrits.&nbsp; After following his advice, my sister and her husbad had
not more problems with spirits.</B>

<P><B>My Ghosts</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: collette_ball@yahoo.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>I am correcting this and if it happens this time I guess someone
doesn't want it told.&nbsp; This is weird I read it over before sending
and it was all there before.&nbsp; okay here goes.......</B>
<BR><B>Ghosts have always been of interest to me as my mother and older
sister have on many occasions encountered them.&nbsp; as a child I was
always dissappointed that I had never had any encounters.&nbsp; Now that
I am an adult I have come to realize they will contact you when they are
ready.</B>
<BR><B>I have had two spirits contact me within the past eight years.&nbsp;
The first encounter was shortly after I was married. My husband and I had
just bought an old house. The first year went peacefully with no strange
occurances and then one night I had a very strange dream.&nbsp; In this
dream I could hear a child crying and walked to the foot of our stairs
where a little boy of around 5 yrs. was sitting.&nbsp; He was dressed in
older fashioned clothing.&nbsp; I can recall a great feeling of sadness
and my heart ached with it.&nbsp; Shortly there after a friend moved in
with us and he occupied one of our upstairs rooms.&nbsp; Strange things
would happen such as his belongings being moved around, lights being turned
on after he left and his covers would be yanked off when he slept.&nbsp;
He would always joke about it and say his invisible buddy was joking around
with him again.&nbsp; After he moved out a couple girls moved in with us
and they each occupied a room upstairs.&nbsp; They were not as lucky. d
that the house used to be the servants living quarters for the house next
door.&nbsp; We no longer live in this house and I often wonder if he plays
the same tricks on the new occupants.</B>
<BR><B>The second encounter I had was after my youngest sister passed away.&nbsp;
She was 15 years old when she died of an inoperable brain tumor.&nbsp;
In life she was such a loving soul and our family was having a really hard
time with her death.&nbsp; The family all gathered at home after her funeral
and we were all sitting around talking about her when her stereo came on
by itself and started playing her favorite song on a cd. We shut it off
and within minutes it came back on again.&nbsp; About a month later I had
a dream about her.&nbsp; I was walking along the street in my town when
I heard a car door slam behind me.&nbsp; I turned and saw a number of kids
piling out of a blue car and walking off in different directions.&nbsp;
I recognized one of these as my deceased sister.&nbsp; I ran up to her
and asked her how she could possibly be here she was dead.&nbsp; She said
she didn't have the time to talk right now she had something she needed
to take care of.&nbsp; I noticed at this point her eyes ,&nbsp; which was
her way of letting us know she was okay and we needn't be sad anymore.&nbsp;
What do you think?</B>

<BR><B>My Apartment Story</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: moonrag@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>To this day no one really believes me.&nbsp; I didn't believe it
myself until the occurrences stopped.&nbsp; That was when I knew that something
extraordinary had happened.</B>
<BR><B>I moved to New York City about 7 years ago and lucked up on a small
bedroom apartment in Inwood, which is at the tip of Manhattan before you
go into the Bronx.&nbsp; I lived in that apartment for 3 years and during
those 3 years some mild but strange things would happen to me.&nbsp; The
building was a pre-war building, my neighbor who was 83 had lived in the
building since she got married when she was 23 years old with her husband!&nbsp;
She was from Sweden.&nbsp; So the building was a walkup and very old.</B>
<BR><B>The main occurence would happen while I was sleeping.&nbsp; I would
feel a "blowing" of a puff of air in my ear.&nbsp; At first I thought it
was my imagination, but after 2 years I started to question if it was something
more happening or was it just some physical phenomenom that was causing
this.&nbsp; Sometimes I would need to get up at certain times to go to
work or a rehearsal and this "blowing" in my ear would happen exactly 2-3
mintues before my alarm would go off.&nbsp; It was consistent, and I thought
maybe I was just doing it subconsciously.&nbsp; After about 2 years the
occurrences become stronger.&nbsp; One night I felt as if someone's lips
touched my ear to blow in it.&nbsp; It really frightened me, but I was
never frightened to the point of moving from the apartment.&nbsp; The last
year that I was there I started to actually hear a voice that would speak
into my ear, always while I was in a sleep, then the "blowing" of the puff
of air would happen.&nbsp; My final year in this apartment I</B>
<BR><B>I finally moved to a larger apartment in the Bronx, and ALL activity
stopped.&nbsp; No blowing puffs of air in my ear, no feeling of not being
alone, no rattling of dishes.&nbsp; It all stopped.&nbsp; It has been 2
years since I've been out of that apartment and I've not had an experience
since then like it.&nbsp; I will always remember it though.&nbsp; It was
odd and I can't explain it, but I think it was probably a haunting.&nbsp;
If I carried the experiences with me I think I would thought it was something
wrong with me.&nbsp; But it hasn't.&nbsp; Nothing has happened since.</B>
<BR><B>Not much, but a little tiny experience.</B>

<P><B>First experience</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: shalley_au_73@yahoo.com.au</B><B></B>

<P><B>hi I have&nbsp;&nbsp; written before to about&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a
car my dad once brought and found he had and extra passenger.&nbsp; well
this is my story now my first experience with the paranormal.&nbsp; We
were living in Adelaide, Australia,&nbsp; I was only 9 and my parents split
up because my mum drank heavily.&nbsp; I went with my mum.&nbsp; We moved
in to a house in&nbsp; Salisbury and she meet up with this other guy and
he&nbsp; moved in,&nbsp; and that was the start of my experience,&nbsp;&nbsp;
He brought with him&nbsp; a large black dog who he called Satan lol I know
a bad start already but the dog was a really nice and friendly dog.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The house we moved in to&nbsp; was like an L shape an L shaped hall with
rooms coming of it,&nbsp; the lounge and kitchen and then around the corner
the left side had the back door then bath room and at the end of the hall
was a bed room and on the right was mums room and my room.&nbsp; mum gave
me the&nbsp; pick of the rooms I walk to the&nbsp; end room and it felt
cold and like I wasn't wonted I left it quickly and chose the other room,
and my brother got that room. well about a week or so after we had been
there me and a friend found a game we could play,&nbsp;&nbsp; the window
in&nbsp; my brothers room we would lock it and go out and shut the door
and count to 10 slowly and go back in there&nbsp; and it would be open,
it did not always do it but we thought it was cool,&nbsp; and in the shower
the shampoo bottle would move from where u put it after using it,&nbsp;
I did tell my mum what was going on but she&nbsp; would not believe us,
for some reason it would never do anything to mum or the BF.&nbsp; well
one day my nice and a friend was over playing with me, we were playing
out side when mum said that her and mark (BF) were going to look at a&nbsp;
boat.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the three of us decided to&nbsp;&nbsp; stay and
play while they went&nbsp; to go look at the boat, which&nbsp; was ok cause
my friends house was only just up the road so mum let us.&nbsp; Any way
they were gone for a few hours it important to tell guys that my mum locked
the house up&nbsp; and they had the dog with them.&nbsp; Well when they
came back well all went in side as&nbsp;&nbsp; we&nbsp; walk in side&nbsp;
there was a small blood drop trail that went up the entrance hall and a
long the main hallway and in to my room and under my bed.&nbsp;&nbsp; mum
put it down to the&nbsp; dog but he was not hurt on his feet or any where
else,&nbsp; well that night I went to&nbsp; bed and I always made mum leave
the hall light on for me and my door slightly open,&nbsp; well my door
shut on it own that&nbsp; night I yelled for my mum as all children do
she came in and opened it again after she left I called breathing noises
under the bed and every time&nbsp; I would call her it would stop this
happened about 3&nbsp; times and&nbsp;&nbsp; mum was getting a bit&nbsp;
announced at me so I sat there under the covers and as soon as they went
to bed I bolted for the lounge room iam not sure at what time this happened
.&nbsp; I called the dog by name to the lounge with me he&nbsp; would not
come and in the lounge theres a gas heater a gainst the wall, well this
began to shake and lift of the floor well I bolt from the lounge and stopped
in front of my mums room and though she would be even madder if I disturbed
her so I prayed&nbsp; the lords pray over and over again I know this will
probably sound dumb but a feeling of&nbsp; being safe and protected came
over me and I got up and went back to bed and there was no noise any more
but to be a shored I rang my dad the next day who was in</B>
<BR><B>Alice Springs at the time and asked him to come and get me and he
did.&nbsp; there is some good out of this my leaving made my mum realize
that she had a drinking problem and now she and dad are back to gether
and she has not had a drink in&nbsp; 13 years.&nbsp; thank you for listening
to my story and if you like u can email me at shalley_au_73@yahoo.com.au</B><B></B>

<P><B>Haunted Place in Tucson, AZ</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: KKula@aol.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>My Deaf roommate owns his house. in Tucson, AZ and I used to live
there for approximately seven months.&nbsp; He mentioned that his house
has several apparations around.</B>
<BR><B>First of all, I was scared by the loud clapping behind my back even
though no one present.</B>
<BR><B>The lamp in his master bedroom was flickering wildly sometimes (maybe
either ghost or old wire).</B>
<BR><B>I noticed some shadows on the wall in hallway and heard loud shout
in other room.</B>
<BR><B>I was alone in living room noticing kitchen light was on by itself.</B>
<BR><B>Finally, I had internal conflicts with my roommate for various reasons...one
day, I slept in my room and noticed the mirror stand still put firmly around
4 a.m. while my roommate left for work as electrician.&nbsp; Around 11
a.m., I woke up finding the heavy mirror fell down about feet away from
my bed.&nbsp; I wondered how the mirror fall instantly on the carpet because
I could not hear the sudden fall of the mirror.&nbsp; Then, I asked my
friend who is psychic online about the mirror, he said that his friends
brought problems to my roommate's house.&nbsp; Few days later, I moved
out for good because I could not deal with the internal problems.</B>
<BR><B>I suspected that the land was haunted because my roommate claimed
that his house has no history of ghost spirits roaming around.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Charlotte's Ghost</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Catsshadow@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>I have a unique story to share and I'm hopeing someone else out
there has experienced a similar event. I have tried to send my story several
times but it keeps coming back to me with large portions missing; almost
like something doesn't want me to send it. I've decided I must try again!
I have to know I'm not crazy and this has happened to someone else. I have
always been sensitive to the spiritual world, and have had ghostly experiences
for as long as I can remember. But this is so different from anything I've
encountered before that I had to write about it.&nbsp; It's important I
start at the beginning so one can fully understand so here it is......................</B>
<BR><B>As far back as I can remember every summer as a child I would spend
some time at my paternal Grandmother's house.</B>
<BR><B>I loved my grandma dearly but her house was not the most compliant
place for an active little girl. She had so many pretty things in her house
and I was never allowed to touch any of them; except for the very few toys
she did keep for me.&nbsp; In the bedroom where I slept sat a beautiful
doll which never under any circumstances could I ever breath to close too.</B>
<BR><B>So naturally I always loved this doll who is about two feet tall,
wears a blue velvet dress with white lace, and a white lacey bonnet over
short brown curly hair. She even has little white dress shoes with delicate
lace socks and pink panties. Around her slender neck she wore a small pearl
neckless. I spent many an hour admiring this doll from where she sat in
an antique hard back chair. I secretly named her Charlotte and sometimes
when I stayed with my grandma I would sneak back into this bedroom, while
she napped, and whispered all my dreams to the doll. Anyway years went
by and I grew up never once getting to hold my beloved Charlotte. Then
after I turned 21 grandma suffered a massive stroke that left her in an
invalid state. We had no choice but to place her into nursing care and
sell her home and belongings. The grim task lay ahead of us to sort through
her house and decide what would go and what we would keep. My father didn't
have the heart to take this on and my older sister. who my grandma was
never very nice to, wanted very little to do with it. So my mother picked
me up early one Saturday morning and we set off to dismantle grandma's
house. The weirdest thing I have ever done, after a life time of never
being able to touch anything at her house there I was going through her
underwear drawer. Anyway the first thing I though of was Charlotte and
claimed her as my own. So for the first time ever I got to pick her up
and hold her and it was a very sad kid of feeling. I took her home and
placed her in a small child sized chair in my bedroom.&nbsp; It seems as
soon as I brought her home strange things began to happen. To this day
almost every time I go into my room I find her sitting in a different position
in her small chair. Some times her head will be turned and sometimes one
of her arms will be lifted. The creepiest is when I find her completely
turned around facing another way. Just this morning I woke up and found
her setting sideways in the chair when I was sure she was sitting in it
correctly when I feel a sleep. Sometimes I swear her face even changes
from her innocent little smile to a look of great sadness. She just has
this weird feeling about and I find my self asking her before I touch her
to move her back as crazy as that seems. Even my cat who gets in to everything
seems to always avoid the chair and the doll. Some times it just feels
like she's watching me and I turn around to find her looking right at me.
I can't explain what's happening it just so weird. Recently I dared to
take a picture of her and I am waiting now for my film to develop to see
what happens. Naturally I had to politely ask her first, I let you know
if I get anything weird. It would be easy to chalk this all up to grandma
her being the way she always was, but grandma is still alive. Although
she has progressed into assisted living she's not the woman she once was.&nbsp;
At first I thought it was kid of cool the things that where happening with
Charlotte but now I'm getting be afraid of her. I don't feel like I have
any right to give her away so I don't know what to do. I guess I'm wondering
if this as ever happened to anyone else so I can feel less insane and alone.
Please let me know what you think!</B><B></B>

<P><B>A Sensitive Family</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: kiml@caamanitoba.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>My ex-boyfriends family is extremely sensitive to the "unknown".
His mother knew the exact moment her father had passed away - even though
it was an unexpected death. She dreamed her father had come to say "good-bye"
and when the phone rang she knew that her father had passed on even before
the words were out of her mothers mouth.</B>
<BR><B>Other stories were told to me throughout the years by all sorts
of his family members. His cousin's girlfriend had been in the kitchen
when she heard someone calling her from the basement. Assuming it was her
boyfriend, she called down to him, but recieved no response. Again, she
was called to come down into the basement, and again when she yelled down
to find out what "he" wanted, there was no response. After doing this back
and forth for a few minutes, she started to become very angry. As she was
yelling at "him" from the top of the stairs, her boyfriend walked out of
the bedroom (on the main floor) demanding to know why she was so angry
with him.... there was no one else in the house with them.</B>
<BR><B>That same year, another of my boyfriends cousins was walking along
the beach in front of her cottage. She encountered an ominous black figure
hovering in front of her. Terrified, she fled back to the cabin to fill
us in on the story. She said that the figure had a very "ugly" feel to
it, and she felt that the figure was extremely angry. Upon researching
the area, it was discovered that a few years before, a man had suffered
from a heart attack, and fell upon the rocks, being killed instantly, on
the exact same strip of beach that she had been walking on.</B>
<BR><B>Finally, after a year of hearing all of these stories, I had a personal
encounter of my own. My boyfriend came to me one evening, saying that he
had seen a ghost in his bedroom the night before. I "sort" of beleived
him at the time, because he brought this up to me without any prior discussion
of ghosts and goblins. He said that he had been upset, and lying on his
bed in his bedroom when he heard someone whispering his name. There was
noone in his room. He felt a little odd, but passed it off as his imagination.
Suddenly, as he was lying looking at the ceiling, a white form began to
take shape above his head. He said he should of been scared to death, but
oddly he felt strangely calmed and less "upset" than he had been. After
a few moments, the figure vanished. About a week later, I slept over at
his house. As I was lying staring into the dark, I heard someone whispering
my name. It was coming out of the corner of his bedroom.&nbsp; I shot up
out of bed and asked my boyfriend if he had heard it to. He hadn't. I asked
him what the voice who spoke to him sounded like and he said it was distinctly
female. I was terrified, as I too had heard the voice of a female.</B>
<BR><B>Time has passed since this event, and sometimes I think it must
have been my imagination. But then I remember the feeling of terror that
had gripped me that night, and I realize that I have to finally give into
my skeptism of his family - because I too now have a "strange" tale to
tell.</B>

<P><B>Haunted Hospital Morgue</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Randy</B><B></B>

<P><B>Just recently Kaiser Permanente closed the basement offices in their
medical</B>
<BR><B>clinic on Parkway Blvd. in La Mesa, California.&nbsp; They claim
that the</B>
<BR><B>frequent mishaps, flooding and accidents in the basement made the
area</B>
<BR><B>untangible for professional use.&nbsp; Primarily they complained
about the</B>
<BR><B>frequent flooding.&nbsp; There is no body of water within miles
of this clinc.</B>
<BR><B>I personally know better.&nbsp; Back in the 1970's I was working
in law</B>
<BR><B>enforcement.&nbsp; I had been on the job only about three years.&nbsp;
I felt very</B>
<BR><B>confident that nothing could rattle me. I was macho and fearless,
big man</B>
<BR><B>with a gun complex.&nbsp; All that would change!</B>
<BR><B>Up unitl about 20 years ago the Kaiser Clinic was the Kaiser Hospital.
The</B>
<BR><B>medical offices in the basement were at that time, the hospital's
morgue.</B>
<BR><B>In the basement was also a break room with snacks and telephones,
and</B>
<BR><B>showers available for medical staff, law enforcement and fire fighters.&nbsp;
It</B>
<BR><B>was open 24 hours a day.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;I frequently stopped by in the middle of the night to clean
up after</B>
<BR><B>rolling around in the dirt with a supsect.</B>
<BR><B>One night I was down in the basement near EOS (End of Shift) at
about 0400</B>
<BR><B>hours.&nbsp; I was absolutely alone.&nbsp; I needed to clean up
after a scuffle with a</B>
<BR><B>DUI suspect.&nbsp; I looked forward to a brief break and some hot
coffee, and</B>
<BR><B>maybe a call to my young wife.</B>
<BR><B>To this day I cannot fully comprehend what happend.&nbsp; For years
it gave me</B>
<BR><B>the creeps.</B>
<BR><B>I was just about to sip on the coffee.&nbsp; The cup was slapped
out of my hand</B>
<BR><B>by a powerful blow.&nbsp; I did not see anyone in the basement.&nbsp;
I felt a cold,</B>
<BR><B>freezing chill around my neck and face.</B>
<BR><B>I was on high alert, feeling that I had been assaulted, but with
no suspect</B>
<BR><B>in sight, I just backed against the wall with my hand on my Smith
&amp; Wesson</B>
<BR><B>stainless steel Mod. 65 (.357 mag).</B>
<BR><B>Seconds later, a male voice screamed, "...get your a** out of my
space...you</B>
<BR><B>don't belong here, I do...now go..."&nbsp; I left out the filthly
language.</B>
<BR><B>I was so spooked I pulled my weapon and dropped to the ground in
a defensive</B>
<BR><B>position.&nbsp; I searched the entire basement, including the morgue.&nbsp;
There was</B>
<BR><B>not a living soul in the area.</B>
<BR><B>Still thinking there might be a prowler or deranged mental patient
hiding</B>
<BR><B>somewhere; stalking the basement, I called for backup officers.</B>
<BR><B>La Mesa and San Diego SO officers responded. To my amazement both
officers</B>
<BR><B>said, "Lee, you just had your first experience with the 5150 {crazy}
son of</B>
<BR><B>b***** that has been screwing with us for years..."&nbsp; They didn't
even bother</B>
<BR><B>to search the area.</B>
<BR><B>I can't recall what these officers told me about their own hauntings,
but</B>
<BR><B>yes, they all had similar expereinces.&nbsp; None of us ever went
back to the</B>
<BR><B>break room at the Kaiser Hospital.</B>
<BR><B>We would take breaks as Mercy Hospital, Alvarado Hospital or Park
Villa, but</B>
<BR><B>not, no way, ever at Kaiser.</B>
<BR><B>Now that I am retired, the hospital has become a clinic.&nbsp; And
of course my</B>
<BR><B>HMO medical provider is Kaiser.&nbsp; My personal Kaiser physician
had his office</B>
<BR><B>in the old morgue basement.</B>
<BR><B>The first time I went in for an appointment I was very unconfortable.&nbsp;
I</B>
<BR><B>briefly told Dr. M..... about my experiences.&nbsp; He assured me
that all the</B>
<BR><B>staff was aware of the ghosts. Oh yes, the good doctor told me tales
of no</B>
<BR><B>less than six different ghosts that prowl the area.</B>
<BR><B>Well, the basement offices are no more.&nbsp; Kaiser has built a
new multi-story</B>
<BR><B>structure.&nbsp; But I bet my S&amp;W Model 65 that the ghosts still
rule the</B>
<BR><B>basement!</B>

<BR><B>Tims Motel</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: dragin@charter.net</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>I used to work at a little hotel called Tim's Motel in Lansdowne
which is just outside of Baltimore on Washington Blvd. This is a rather
small hotel which was a house before converting. In 4 specific rooms, several
spirits have been found. In room 22, a man hung himself in the closet and
the room has been described as "feeling of death". In room 26, it's been
told that you could feel a kind of pain at the top of the second set of
steps. Rooms 27 and 28 were once the kitchen before the house was converted
into a hotel, so it could be possible they share a spirit or 2. I've seen
a flash of light (where the light outside the room wasn't close enough
to flash) in 27. There's also a picture in the wood over the bed that seems
very erie. In room 28, I was told there were possibly 3 ghosts upon questioning
another employee. What I do know about that room is, on a clear day, I
went in and it seemed fine. Later on, a storm brewed. Well, just as the
storm arrived, I had to go into 28 again. I've never felt like I was watched
at that high point again, and I hope I never do as it gave me such an overwhelming
sense of fear. I fear fairly little if that's a sign as to what feelings
this night gave me. I couldn't stop looking around, and the only time the
feeling went away was when I went into the bathroom or left the room. The
main section of the room had such a feeling. I really don't know what I'd
have done if I'd have actually seen something while looking around and
into the mirror.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Wick Hill Haunting</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: temptation_waits@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>This happened to my sister and her friend at a school where I used
to go to in Berkshire, England which is supposedly the most haunted county
in England.</B>
<BR><B>The school is broken up into two main sections- there is the main
school and another part called Wick Hill which is located within sight
of the main building. This place is a very run down building where a few
years ago it was used as a sports hall where we did P.E (sports education).
It now occassionly gets used in the summer as an examination hall so during
the rest of the time it's pretty much deserted but ever since I first stepped
foot inside there it really gave me the creeps!</B>
<BR><B>The place has several sections- there is a front entrance which
has lockers in it, in the middle is the main hall which you have to cut
across to get to the changing rooms at the far end which has more lockers.
The building can only be accessed through the front entrance which was
permantly locked up some time ago or through the storage cuboard at the
far end next to the changing rooms. The main hall was also used as a theatre
and there is a huge stage which is partically covered by curtains and used
as a storage areas for desks etc. Because of this is is very dark and you
can't help wondering if theres anything lurking around behind the shadows.</B>
<BR><B>This particular day my sister and her friend were going up to wick
hill with the rest of the class (only girls) at the end of the day to get
their clothes from their lockers. Everyone went through the store cupboard
into the changing rooms. My sisters locker was located right at the other
end of Wick Hill in the main entrance which was locked up. Everyone was
making their way home by now whilst they fetched the keys to the main hall
from the teacher who told them to lock up the building after they had finished.
By now it was really quiet with just the two of them alone. My sister was
already a bit apprehensive about going in there so they quickly unlocked
the door and entered the hall preparing to get out of there as quick as
possible.</B>
<BR><B>Although it was bright and sunny outside- it was dark and cold inside.
Massive drapes had been hung up from the tops the the windows, blocking
out most of the sunlight . Being a school on a budget only a thick black
material had been used to cover the windows and keep out intruders, and
it had been ripped and was gently flapping in the breeze. The place hadn't
been used for ages so there couldn't have been anyone inside. As they crossed
the hall they heard muffled voices from behind the stage curtain. They
both freaked out and legged it to their lockers getting changed as quickly
as possible. They were both really scared of going back through and looked
through the keyhole of the door but couldn't see anyone there. Halfway
across the hall on the way back they suddenly saw lots of tiny little feet
(wearing trainers) silently moving around at the gap at the bottom of the
curtain where it didn't quite reach the ground. They ran out into the dimley
lit</B>
<BR><B>When they got back to the changing rooms in the main school they
told the teacher that they thought someone was locked in the building.
She just laughed at them and joked that they were going to be locked in
there for a long time considering it wouldn't be used over the weekend-
basically she didn't beleive them. Firstly the fact that it was a girl's
PE lesson and a secondary school what would a little boy be doing in the
building makes this strange. Also NO-ONE else would have been using the
building and my sister and her friend were the first ones to go in that
part for several weeks.</B>
<BR><B>I could tell a couple of other stories from when we were much younger
but I've put those down to an over-active imagination but I have crazy
electrical equipment in my room, for example one night a few weeks ago,
I went to sleep annoyed because my cd player had broken and wouldn't switch
on. But I was awoke by the noise of it switching itself on -this has happened
with my table lamp too but I just put it down to being just one of those
things. There's one other story I have from a few months back when we visited
New York but my family have just gone out leaving me in the house on my
own so I'll tell it another time Thank you for listening.</B>

my house</B>
<BR><B>was completely unexplainable and i knew it brought an extemely negative</B>
<BR><B>energy. it was a thick heavy emotion of anger and evil. i felt tight
and</B>
<BR><B>breathless inside my chest, right in the centre was a dull ache.
my head was</B>

a sick feeling</B>

i was</B>

<BR><B>a door where a dark whisp of a shadow entered. i felt so vulnerable
to</B>
<BR><B>something bad that i had this desperate and strong feeling to shut
all doors</B>
<BR><B>in the house, bedrooms bathrooms front back, all curtains were drawn
and the</B>
<BR><B>fans and lights were turned off (it was day) nothing could be exposed
or</B>
<BR><B>moving. this happened a year and a half ago.&nbsp; i'm normal and
calm now and no</B>
<BR><B>longer scared of what happened. at the time i was hysterical and

<BR><B>was losing my grip. i was so scared by this intense feeling of evil
and</B>
<BR><B>terrifying emotion i thought it would kill me i felt death. i felt
evil</B>
<BR><B>coming from everywhere something was around that was very angry
i felt anger</B>
<BR><B>coming towards me, evil anger. this incident lasted 3 days. after
it</B>
<BR><B>happened i prayed for God, i smelt God that day, it was the sweetest
scent</B>
<BR><B>that i&nbsp; smelt in my life and i never smelt it after, it was
sweet and thick</B>
<BR><B>i knew it was God because i felt purged of something, i felt light
and</B>
<BR><B>forgiven i smiled and i cried for such a relief and amazement that
i was</B>
<BR><B>living the event. God really came to me and blessed me, the air
was so light</B>
<BR><B>and cool to breath in. it had felt so heavy and hot to inhale before.
there</B>
<BR><B>were 3 people with me who supported me through what was happening,
they</B>
<BR><B>picked up the atmosphere beforehand and reacted the same as me which</B>
<BR><B>confirmed i wasnt going nuts, they stuck around and helped me. Gods
blessing</B>
<BR><B>was for me, as his scent was so sweet and strong and the air just
seemed to</B>
<BR><B>change so quickly and lighter, the other 3 couldnt even detect a
whiff of</B>
<BR><B>what i was describing i could smell, they didn't even notice a difference
in</B>
<BR><B>the atmosphere but for some reason they seemed extremely more calmer.</B>

<P><B>Uncle</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: gcochran@thiess.com.pe</B><B></B>

<P><B>I have had various experiences which I can not explain, but one that
sticks with me is something I can not come to grips with, even today.</B>
<BR><B>I was in bed asleep with my wife one night when I woke up staring
at the ceiling. At this moment I was wide awake but unaware of my wifes
conscious state. The room was illuminated by a combination of, an outside
streetlight and our venetian blinds being partly open.</B>
<BR><B>The room became instantly pitch black and the venetian blinds started
to slam against the widow sill, I then had my wife wrapped around me petrified
as she too was awake at this time. I stood up and found my way to the windows
in the dark and reached out to close them. I could not pull the windows
closed for some reason and I could not see the street light which was only
some 20mtrs away. I then returned to the bed with my terrified wife and
just lay there, then I felt like something was pushing down on me and I
could not breath. This lasted about 1minute then everything returned to
normal. The room was illuminated by the street light and everything was
calm, not even a breeze.</B>
<BR><B>I rolled over to look at the clock which registered 0330hrs then
went back to sleep.</B>
<BR><B>At 0700hrs a relative was banging at the door to tell me my uncle
had died at 0330hrs that morning from his asthma.</B>
<BR><B>This particular uncle was not all that close to me but I did love
him to pieces as he was a big part of my child hood, the thing I have tried
to work out all this time was..,</B>
<BR><B>Was it him that came to visit me when he was dying, or was it the
fact, that my sister was trying to save him at the time of his death, as
she was there.</B>
<BR><B>He died 200klms from my home, so I guess spooks dont have any problems
with distances.</B><B></B>

a true story my father told me.&nbsp; My family has traveled allot around
Australia because of my fathers work,&nbsp; and he need to&nbsp; get a

second hand car that was in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; good condition.&nbsp; he&nbsp;
was travelling home with the car and it was about 1:00&nbsp;&nbsp; in the
morning and he said he was about 30 mins from&nbsp; home and the car got
cold and them a loud high pitched scream came from the back seat , and
he was totally alone in the car.&nbsp; Well he made that 30 min drive in
to a 15 min drive and sold the car the next day he later found out that
the car had been involved&nbsp; in an&nbsp; accident and a young girl had
been killed in the car.</B><B></B>

<P><B>The USS Lexington in Corpus Christi, Texas.</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: banjo01@gci.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>In Corpus Christi, Texas, the ghost on the Lexington is dressed in
WWII era</B>
<BR><B>clothing. I know, Because he directed me to a bathroom I could use
on the</B>
<BR><B>ship. I was getting pretty desperate.&nbsp; I had a kidney infection
that was not</B>
<BR><B>very nice, so I had to go quickly when the urge hit or I would need
cleanup.</B>
<BR><B>This young sailor literally popped out of nowhere next to the boiler
room,</B>
<BR><B>and I thought he was a reenactor working on the ship. I commented
on how</B>
<BR><B>cold that part of the ship was considering that the summer heat
was over 100</B>
<BR><B>degrees that day (after he had given directions to the bathroom).&nbsp;
He just</B>
<BR><B>said, "Yes, Ma'am." to that comment. Then I thanked him again, and&nbsp;
ran off</B>
<BR><B>to the bathroom...which I found out later was not for public use.
I tried</B>
<BR><B>desperately to find him to thank him again, and ask about his uniform
being</B>
<BR><B>so realistic. Was it an original from WWII, I wondered?</B>
<BR><B>I was working with the Director of the Museum to create an ad campaign
for</B>
<BR><B>the ship, and had been given free reign to explore any lighted areas
on my</B>
<BR><B>own. So, when I met with one of the director's assistants later
that day, I</B>
<BR><B>told him I thought it was real nice he was working with re-enactors
on the</B>
<BR><B>ship.&nbsp; He looked puzzled and asked me what I meant, so I told
him what</B>
<BR><B>happened and described the sailor right down to his amazing blue
eyes, blond</B>
<BR><B>hair, dimples and crisp, authentic WWII uniform. And, that I had
even</B>
<BR><B>thought it was so real-looking that the uniform might have been
an original</B>
<BR><B>that had been very well preserved.&nbsp; He then told me I had just
seen the</B>
<BR><B>Lexington Ghost, and had been guided to a non-public bathroom which
only</B>
<BR><B>worked part-time...and that THIS DAY they would not have worked
and there</B>
<BR><B>would not have been any lights on in the part of the ship I had
wandered</B>
<BR><B>into.&nbsp; I told him, everywhere I had been had been lighted,
and the water</B>
<BR><B>systems worked just fine. He checked and it was verified that the
ship had</B>
<BR><B>not had power on in those areas.&nbsp; Yet, in my "wanderings" into
the bowels of</B>
<BR><B>the ship, I must have been helped.</B>
<BR><B>Later I was shown pictures of the men from WWII who had served on
the ship,</B>
<BR><B>and had been there when she had been shelled badly.&nbsp; Many of
the young men</B>
<BR><B>in the pictures had died.&nbsp; I was very surprised to find the
face of the</B>
<BR><B>young man that guided me staring back at me from a black and white
photo</B>
<BR><B>more than 50 years after his death.</B>
<BR><B>Once more, when I was on board, I got lost following bad directions
to where</B>
<BR><B>my contact person was supposed to be supervising some work on the
ship.&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>decided I had better give up when I realized that there was no sound
around</B>
<BR><B>me, except a dull hollow metal ring.&nbsp; That meant I had gone
pretty far into</B>
<BR><B>the bowels of the ship.&nbsp; I could feel the cold close in around
me, and I</B>
<BR><B>blurted out in frustration, "OK.&nbsp; I'm lost.&nbsp; Now, get
me outta here!" Or</B>
<BR><B>something close to that.&nbsp; Just a few moments later a worker
showed up to</B>
<BR><B>rescue me.&nbsp; He had been directed to me by the "fella in the
reenactors</B>
<BR><B>group."&nbsp; Upon inquiry, we found out that his "fella" was a
brunette and</B>
<BR><B>older than my "re-enactor" and there was still NO RE-ENACTORS on
board, or</B>
<BR><B>even scheduled to be on board, or in the area at that time. It was
then I</B>
<BR><B>found out that there is more than one sailor still patrolling that
ship, and</B>
<BR><B>I had been helped by two of them!</B>
<BR><B>That young worker was freaked out when he was told he had seen a
"ghost".</B>
<BR><B>His supervisor told him, and so did his co-workers but he still
refused to</B>
<BR><B>believe it hadn't been someone "live".&nbsp; I, however, have always
felt an</B>
<BR><B>affinity for the old ship and her "crew". Since my experiences,
I have</B>
<BR><B>learned that on clear dark nights, when the moon is out, you can
see a line</B>
<BR><B>of young sailors in WWII era uniforms looking out over her railings,
always</B>
<BR><B>ready for duties call...even in death.</B>

<P><B>The Little Boy in the Hall</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Danaf69@kricket.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>One day I was in the bathroom in my home and was looking into my
mirror.&nbsp; I have a three way mirror that you can move, and I could
see my hallway from the position my mirror was in.&nbsp; Through the mirror
I saw a young boy, probably 9 or 10, in a red and white stripped shirt
with dark blue jeans on.&nbsp; He had blond hair and icy blue eyes.&nbsp;
He was crouched down in the hallway and was staring up at me. When I turned
to look in the direction he was, there was nobody there.&nbsp; When I first
saw it, I was not frightened.&nbsp; It is like it didn't hit me until a
little while later.&nbsp; I have never seen him since, but get a very deep
sense that he is still around, but that he knows it would scare me if he
showed himself again.&nbsp; I have never disbelieved in ghosts but never
really believed in them either.&nbsp; I really can't explain what I saw
that day.&nbsp; I do know that I was home alone.&nbsp; My front door was
locked and all my children were in school.&nbsp;&nbsp; I live in my grandmothers
home, she never had any boys and my grandparents are the ones that built
the home I live in.&nbsp; I have no clue to who he was.&nbsp; I have never
seen him before or since.</B>

<BR><B>&nbsp;The Disappearing Glowing Man and Other Stories</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Troika101@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B><B></B>

<P><B>I have always had an interest in the paranormal and reading other
people's</B>
<BR><B>experiences, but I never thought I would ever have one of my own.
I have</B>
<BR><B>always had the ability to "sense" the feelings that places give
off, but I</B>
<BR><B>didn't think that I was "sensitive" enough to see any actual</B>
<BR><B>apparitions---until about a week ago, that is.</B>
<BR><B>I was lying in my bed that night watching the 10:00 news, and I
sort of</B>
<BR><B>started to "zone out." I was in that strange state where you are
not</B>
<BR><B>sleeping, but not fully aware either (and I am not referring to
sleep</B>
<BR><B>paralysis). I was conscious enough to hear and comprehend the report
on TV,</B>
<BR><B>though. Suddenly, I saw a person walk across my room. He was an
old man,</B>
<BR><B>wearing a checkered button-up work shirt and jeans, and he had normal
old,</B>
<BR><B>wrinkly features. He was glowing white. He looked down at me as
he passed,</B>
<BR><B>only to disappear somewhere behind me (or into the closet, which
also was out</B>
<BR><B>of my vision from where my bed is). It took a little while for it
to register</B>
<BR><B>that what I saw wasn't normal, but when it did, I shot up off my
bed and tore</B>
<BR><B>the sheets off in the process. I was standing there in the middle
of my room</B>
<BR><B>with the bedsheet in my hand staring open-mouthed at the wall that
he</B>
<BR><B>evidently walked through (when I came to my senses and flew out
of bed, it</B>
<BR><B>didn't feel like I'd just came out of a dream or anything, I just
got up out</B>
<BR><B>of bed). I don't know where he came from, who he was, or why his
spirit came</B>
<BR><B>to visit me (I am living in a part of my house that has just been
remodeled,</B>
<BR><B>it is in the basement which once was horrible looking and dark,
and my</B>
<BR><B>bedroom was once a nasty abandoned room that nobody used for anything
and was</B>
<BR><B>unfinished from the time the house was bought. I do not know if
this has</B>
<BR><B>anything to do with the ghost or not).</B>
<BR><B>Some other experiences I have had include an earring back being
returned to</B>
<BR><B>me after I had dropped it at school in the downstairs locker room
(it had</B>
<BR><B>rolled under one of the lockers, and I thought I'd have to buy another
one,</B>
<BR><B>but then the next morning I woke up to step on it as I came back
from</B>
<BR><B>showering), small black figures running very fast across my floor
when I was</B>
<BR><B>younger and in my old upstairs bedroom (they looked liked small
squirrels,</B>
<BR><B>and I stopped seeing them when I was about nine or ten years old),
and also</B>
<BR><B>when I was about that age I used to hear a deep growling sound from
one of</B>
<BR><B>the corners of that same upstairs bedroom, which also went away
as I got</B>
<BR><B>older (or to be more precise, when I told it to "shut up"). I have
also had</B>
<BR><B>an unseen entity whisper something to me while looking in the doorway
of one</B>
<BR><B>of the desolate flooded rooms of the Wabasha Street Caves in St.
Paul, MN (I</B>
<BR><B>don't know what it said), and always felt an "uneasy" presence watching
me</B>
<BR><B>while in my old upstairs bedroom. When I moved downstairs, it went
away.</B>
<BR><B>Whenever I go up there and spend substantial time there though,
the feeling</B>
<BR><B>always comes back.</B>
<BR><B>Thanks for reading, and feedback would be appreciated if anyone
knows what</B>
<BR><B>kind of spirits could have caused any one of my experiences (especially</B>
<BR><B>information on the black things, the growling entity that listened
to me, and</B>

<P><B>Never Believed</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: lrw2@cox.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>I'm now 18 years old.&nbsp; My mother, brother, sister and i moved
into our house in the begining of Feb. two years ago.&nbsp; My niece was
born Feb. 28th of that year.&nbsp; My mom and sister said that at night
they would hear a baby crying thinking it was my niece but there were times
they would hear it when my niece was there.&nbsp; For awhile this was happening,
but no one else heard or noticed anything.&nbsp; I finally heard the cry
once when i was home by myself but i didn't really think anything of it.&nbsp;
The first year around Christmas time we had this extention cord goin across
the top of our wall.&nbsp; Well my sister said that one day she was sitting
in the living room watching the t.v when all of the sudden the chord was
violently pulled down except the end was still attached and it was dangling
there.</B>
<BR><B>Then, around the same time my sister's boyfriend was staying with
us and he told me that one night he thought he heard a baby crying so he
got up and went to go check in my niece's room to see if she was okay (thinking
it was her crying).&nbsp; Well, when he got up to the door he put his ear
against to see if he could hear her.&nbsp; He said he could hear feet shuffling
in there like bare feet on carpet so he opened the door and to his surprise,
my niece was sound asleep and no one else was in the room.&nbsp; Many nights
my niece would wake up screaming.&nbsp; Not like how a normal baby would
when they first wake up, but like she was frightened or something so when
we would go in there to get her she would be shaking bad.&nbsp; For the
longest we thought maybe there were ghosts in her room.&nbsp; It worried
me so bad and i felt so bad for my niece.&nbsp; It made me upset because
there was nothing i could do.&nbsp; I was the only one that hadn't really
experienced anything except when i heard a little cry one time until a
few months ago.</B>
<BR><B>I was laying in my bed one night facing the wall.&nbsp; I wasn't
a sleep or anything, i was just laying there.&nbsp; Then i heard my door
open and i felt as if there was someone else in the room so i turned over
to look and no one was there.&nbsp; But the crazy thing about all of it
was that.............i don't have a door.&nbsp; We took it down to sand
it and paint it when i was redoing my room and never put it back up, but
that night i heard my "door" being opened and i don't even have one.&nbsp;
The next day i told my sister about at and she told me that at nights she
would hear it too sometimes.&nbsp; She would hear feet shuffling in the
hall and then she would hear my door being opened knowing that i don't
have one.&nbsp; We haven't experienced anything lately.&nbsp; They usually
accure around Christmas time though.&nbsp; My mom was so freaked out about
it that she was going to call a ghost hunter to come and check out our
house.&nbsp; She never really believed in ghosts until we moved here.</B>

<P><B>My Experiences</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: jvoight@telus.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>My name is jennifer and I've seen entities and ghosts all my life.
It started when we lived in Quebec. My family comes from Hungary and weve
always had weird , sometimes frieghtening things happen. The first thing
I recall is wathching my family have a saence in our summer kitchen on
the farm. I was about four years old. The table was dancing in the room
while my brother, cousin and I sat on the other side of the curtain and
watched. Then when I was about six, my father and I were heading to the
nearest town and when we passed the local cemetery about half a mile from
the farm, there was the most beautiful women that I have ever seen, standing
at a headstone looking down, we thought this weird as no one ever came
to the cemetery, since the church closed down. You guessed it when I turned
around, she was gone, vanished into thin air.</B>
<BR><B>Things were always happening on the farm. There was alot of talk
about the way things were before we moved there.Apparently, the person
who lived in the farm before us had seen her dead husband in the kitchen
sitting at the table late one night, I guess she flipped out and took off
screaming all over the place.</B>
<BR><B>This is my most vivd and probably the greatest thing that ever happened
to me. When I was about twelve years old, I went to stay with my grandparents
in southern ontario, I spent the summer working in tobacco with them. One
night, It must have beenaround midnight, I went to bed upstairs in a room
I shared with my grandmother. The thing about my grandparents house is
that you always felt that you were being watched, especially at night,
you would do the run down the hall and up the stairs as fast as possible,
before someone grabbed you. Well, I was just getting to sleep, when in
the top corner of the room(right hand corner) There was the most brightest
light I had ever seen. I thought that it was the farmer next door checking
on his crops and the headlights were shining throught the window. With
a quick glance outside I came to the conclusion that was not it. So I crawled
back in bed and tried to get some sleep. About 30 minutes later the light
was back in the corner of the room. I tried to get my grandmother up but
she would not move. As I sat there and watched this extremely bright light
, It started to move closer to me. I all of a sudden felt nothing but total
peace and happiness. It was close enough that I could see the most sweetest
girl inside the light. I reached out to touch it and it just stopped and
sat there for a minute. The girl was so sweet, she had a headfull of blonde
ringlets and the most beautiful blue eyes that you ever seen, and she had
the most white wings i ever will see, she was an angle.</B>
<BR><B>After about 90 second she was gone, no more light, no more angle.</B>
<BR><B>As you probably guessed, I was really confused as to what in the
hell that was. I kew what it was, just had never seen one as sweet and
innocent as that one.</B>
<BR><B>In the morning I got up and got ready for work, My uncle was already
down stairs sitting at the table. When I sat down, I immediately had to
tell him what I had saw. He sat there real quiet, then continued eating
his breakfast. He told me that it was okay and that there had been many
things seen at the house, especially, my great grandparents. My ggrandfather
is known to have his nightly glass of scotch in the breeze way and leave
out the bottle and glass, and my ggrandmother has been seen walking around
the yard singing old hungarian songs. He told me not to worry and that
this kind of stuff will happen alll my life because of the backround of
the family, and our beliefs. When I try to get info out of anybody in the
family, they dodge the questions and tell me it's going to be ok.</B>
<BR><B>I live now in BC and have a daughter of my own, still to this day
I have things happen to me, I see things, people. But I am not scared.
When I was younger I was terrified of death, I thought what a shitty deal,
we live, die and thats it. But I know better now a days. We go somewhere
very special, where there is eternal peace,&nbsp; I am not affraid to die
anymore.</B>
<BR><B>My boyfriend on the other hand thinks Im nuts and out of it. But
WHEN YOU SEE YOU WILL BELIEVE. I will always have these&nbsp; special reminders
that were just for me, to make me see and to keep me humble</B>

<BR><B>My Old House</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Redneckshedevil2@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>IN 1995 My mother and I moved in to an older home in Belton, Texas
Its a small town located just off the old chisolm trial.&nbsp; When we
first looked at the house it was like someone had given us a hug, it was
such a warm feeling of welcome. We had to do a lot of work on the house
because of the age normal wear and tear and the house had been vandalized
about a month after moving in I started hearing foot steps on the stairs.
I was not the only one though my mother heard them too. We never felt threatened
by these things just a little spooked. One day while I was at school Child
protective services called my mother at work and wanted here to came home
so that they could see if there were any children in the house. My mother
let them in to see and naturally there was no one there.&nbsp; The neighbors
had reported seeing a young girl staring out the side doors.&nbsp; Later
in the year My mother and I had both seen similar apparition of a little
girl in the same dress. I didn't want to tell her because I figured she
would have thought I was crazy. a year after moving out of the house she
told me the story and I told her mine.&nbsp; I went to the library in town
to do research to see if by any chance there might have been a ghost and
low and behold a girl in 1948 had been murdered in her house at the same
address. She was not the only ghost there. There was an Older woman who
would stand at the foot of my bed at night to "keep an eye on me" never
causing any harm or discomfort to me I felt it quite nice. My mother was
going through her pictures and I had discovered it was her grandmother.
In August of 1995 I had a shi-tzu that had died while I was away she would
always chase my friends and I up the stairs and bite our ankles if we were
running on the staircase. When I returned home a friend of mine was starring
the night and she had ran up the stairs to get her things when she came
back sown something had bitten her ankle and drawn blood.&nbsp; To the
side of the stairs where the dog had passed we had put a table there for
putting puzzles together.&nbsp; My sister was in because I was due to have
my son at anyway. She and I were putting a puzzle together when she felt
something licking her foot.&nbsp; she jump to look at the bottom of her
foot and it was wet. We have not lived there for a while now but some friend
of mine moved in there after we left they did not stay long due to these
apparitions. Since I have left I have still had occurrences but I do not
have a problem with mine it's like they just drop in to say hi every now
and then. When it rains the dog still hides under my bed or jumps in bed
with me &amp;my husband at night. The older woman (Grams) now watches my
kids and nobody had heard or seen from the little girl.</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: MoonPrincess1316@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hello. I had a story you might be intriged in, It started five years
ago. I was in the bathroom at school in a back stall and I turned around
and I saw the Grim Reaper hovering there. I screamed and ran right into
the stall door. Wasnt very smart. Anyway my friend heard me and came running.
I told her in a rush what I saw. Her eyes got wide we washed quickly and
streaked back to the classroom where I explained again to another friend.
Well, two weeks excatly later my aunt passed away. I was thinking, maybe
it was a warning that she was going to die. I thought he would go away.
But even after her death I saw him. Repeatdly. It seemed that he was taunting
me. Following me. Scared me greatly. I was a rather level headed person
mind you. I didnt scare easily. Over the course of the five years I saw
him I tried banishing him three times along with my friends that I told
that say. I saw furry little red eyed demons. Now, after about a year of
not a single sighting of him I see him again. One late night I was looking
out my window in the living room and there he was staring back at me. It
happened the following night. And the following weekend. I told the friends
who went through this all before and they were completely stunned. I know
I'm not imagining things. They've seen him too. Thats my story. All real
nothing made up.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Driving on Northway New York Route 87</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Harveylock@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>My wife and I were driving on The Northway going to Plattsburgh
NY one night in The dead of winter, to see my brother in law at the Hospital.
And between Keeseville and Peru New York the wind was blowing hard , and
on top of the below temperatures I was watching the road real close because
of blowing snow. I looked ahead an saw a person coming over the guardrails
a few yards down the road . I turned to my wife and said this person coming
over the guard rail do you see him and she responed with yes I do.And I
said Hon look he only has a robe and sandles on. Our response was he look
just like Jesus ,We though it was kind of a warning sign ,because it was
not long after that my Brother in law died.&nbsp; He walk wright in front
of our car and cross the road .After I stoped and backed the car up to
see who it could be , but there was no one there and no foot tracks or
not a&nbsp; sign of anyone crossing the road. We both though we were crazy
and best not to say anythiung about this for people will think we are crazy
. But this did really did happen. This was a quite a few years back , but
every time I go by the spot where we saw this person I always remember
this night</B>

<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>By: dave.williams33@btopenworld.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>My name is Emma and i live in Southampton, Hampshire, UK.&nbsp;
My e-mail address is emmapayne20@hotmail.co.uk just incase this has shown
up as my boyfriends e-mail address.</B>
<BR><B>Now my experiences consist of voices (not in my head!!) and noises
around the house!</B>
<BR><B>When i was younger i had a lot of things go on around me that i
never thought could be anything out of the ordinary but as i have grown
older and got into the supernatural i have put two and two together and
come up with four!&nbsp; My first rememberable experience was when i was
about 10ish and i had a friend over to stay, i awoke in the night to find
a round patch of light on the floor, it was pure white, so as you do i
went and checked for reflection or something but even as i put my hand
right over it there was NO shadow what so ever.&nbsp; My parents said it
was probably my friends Game Boy he had with him!&nbsp; But this kept on
occuring, some nights it would be bigger then others it would be like a
pin prick but it was still there.&nbsp; To this day i have no idea what
it was!&nbsp; But i do believe it wasn't anything anyone could explain!</B>
<BR><B>When i was 13 (i am now 21) i had a visit from my great Uncle,who
is deceased, i never saw him but i awoke very quick to a cold feeling and
i heard him say that my Nan would be ok, as far as i knew she was.&nbsp;
But the next day she was rushed to hospital and it all started making sense!&nbsp;
She was very ill for a while, then one day we went to visit and my Dad
is very sceptical on all things supernatural, but i was sat right next
to my nan in this big comfy chair, there were no windows open infront or
behind me but as i sat there i felt this mass of cold air and my hair wooshed
back, my Dad saw this and stared in amazment then my Nan turned and looked
at me and said "Don't worry it's only George" who was her brother (Great
uncle to me).&nbsp; I'll never forget that feeling, i think that was the
moment i believed!!&nbsp; She knew it and so did i!&nbsp; My Nan unfortunatley
passed away a little while later but a lot more things happened!!&nbsp;
Myself and my sister would experience very very loud banging, enough to
actually wake us then as the minutes and banging went on they would get
so fierce they would actually shake the bed, but my Mum and Dad never ever
heard any of this, although i do know my Mum saw my Nan (She was my Mum's
mum) on the stair case in our house!&nbsp; My sister is a very strong believer
too and she has always backed me on this!&nbsp; I knew she never meant
any harm but it was frightening for me and my sister, my sister saw her
once.&nbsp; Then our dog died and that was it, the banging stopped, we
never heard anymore, i think it was her way of saying we would be ok, i
loved my dog a lot but felt comfort after realising she was there to see
us through!&nbsp; This all sounds mad, like i'm insane but it truly happened
and i know what i heard.</B>
<BR><B>I have had one sighting, it was what i believe to be my Guardian
Angel.&nbsp; I was asleep and it was about 3am and i awoke very sharply,
as i focused i could see a figure at the end of my bed, i knew who it was
instantly, he just stood there watching me, i was cold and all the hairs
were up but yet i felt immense calmness, then it faded.&nbsp; About 2 months
later i met a friends mum who is described as a white witch, she's lovely,
we hit it off straight away.&nbsp; We were all sat at a table ready to
go out and joking about she held my hand and instanly grabbed a ring i
had on, it was my nan's, she knew straight away who'd it was, i was close
to my friend but i had never said who's ring it was or much about my past.&nbsp;
Then she told me she had a very good feeling about me and that i had a
Guardian Angel.&nbsp; She went on to say that i referred to him as a relative
but yet he wasn't and that he was keen on gardening.&nbsp; She had no way
of knowing who it could be and i promise that to this day.&nbsp; I believe
it is my Uncle Sid, although not related he cared for me as a family friend
from the age of about 4 and he was a landscape gardner.&nbsp; He died of
a massive heart attack when i was 14.&nbsp; I was devastated but feel relief
to know he's with me all the time!</B>
<BR><B>I don't mind if you don't publish this but it feels great to tell
it all, the only people who know any of this are my immediate family, my
boyfriend, and my very very close friends and that's only a few of them,
people don't seem to believe so i don't tell but somewhere like here i
know people will believe me and share their own same experiences.</B>

<P><B>&nbsp;The Tower</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Xbroxibearx@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>when i was about 6 my older sister (11) and i went on holiday to
an old ruined caravan park in&nbsp; a place called blairgowrie in scotland.
we made friends with 2 other kids there called linda (12) and charles (10).
they were the only other family there and had been going there for 6 weeks
every summer so they knew their way around. anyway one day they decided
to show us around the surroundings of the park. they took us through a
forest at the back of the park. when we came out i can remember seeing
an old ruin of what looked like a tower. we kept walking and came across
a house which looked like it had been on fire. we went inside and i can
remember that as soon as you went in there was stairs leading up to the
bedrooms. the bottom of the stairs though had broken away and a kids trycicle
was down the hole. suddenly we heard music coming from the living room.
we jumped over the hole into the living room and saw a piano playing by
itself! it defanitly wasnt one of those mechanical ones and we clould see
they keys moving by themselves. there was a dent in the padding of the
stool looking like someone was sitting on it. we all ran away screaming.
later linda told us that a family used to live in the house but the man
fell asleep with a lit cigarette and killed his family. she also said the
man was a pianist!</B>

<BR><B>The Ghost in The Loft</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: klkiatappin@msn.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>Not very long ago about just 2 to 3 weeks ago I was spending a school
night over at my best friends house Amanda.&nbsp; Her mom has lots of money
and they are living in the garage of another persons house while there
house is being planned and built.</B>
<BR><B>There is a loft up the stairs.&nbsp; Her mom sleeps in the guest</B>
<BR><B>room so its separate from the garage but if you go through two doors
it goes to the garage.&nbsp; Well one night me and Amanda were just whispering
to each other laying in her bed trying to go sleep about 11 o'clock at
night.&nbsp; All of a sudden we heard&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bang&nbsp; bang&nbsp;&nbsp;
bang&nbsp;&nbsp; stomping all up the stairs and into the loft.&nbsp; Her
mom came out of the room yelling because she needs to get up early for
work in the morning, "GIRLS GET INTO BED RIGHT NOW"!!!&nbsp; We started
laughing hard.&nbsp; She yelled once again "I MEAN IT, RIGHT NOW, GET DOWN
HERE"!!! We screamed back again&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - we are in the room,
we are down here.&nbsp; She had opened the bedroom door and said "oh".&nbsp;
She went back to bed&nbsp; and then there was so much more stomping everywhere
up in the loft.&nbsp; We just stared at each other. The stomping started
going down the stairs. We didnt take it seriously in till the stomping
got into the kitchen and started knocking things onto the ground. We got
up and looked outside into the kitchen. The stuff on our dining room table
was all rearranged and a bunch of stuff was on the ground. My brother and
his friend were over but they were sleeping on the couch snoring (her brother
is not a good fake sleeper). A couple weeks later I went to Amanda's house
again. We heard a bunch of rustling in my brothers room and some grunts
and panting. The door to the hallway opened and closed 7 times in a row
like someone coulde'nt make up there mind of where they wanted to go, in
or out.</B>
<BR><B>Amanda asked unsurely "Mom" Her mom would always answer no matter
how tired she was. There was no answer. Her brother was in his room sound
asleep. We saw a huge shadow on the roof like a man walking around very
slowly. Amanda's room is a temperary room so it has no roof to it,( not
to see the sky sort of roof). We talked about it before going to bed and
woke up in the morning to her mom waking us up. "What" Amanda said. "Were
you guys rough housing in your brothers room" she said "No". Her mom said
"Thats kind of funny because there's a huge hole in your brothers door".
We got up and walked up the stairs to the loft we had heard noises to a
week ago. Amanda walked up before me. We saw an messed up stair and tried
to avoid it. Avoiding the broken stair we suddenly felt really cold then
felt our feet slipping. We had fallen through. We were in such a daze we
had taken a few minutes to remember what had happened a moment ago. We've
been afraid to climb those stairs since. They have always been so sturdy
but it's kind of weird they would suddenly weaken. You may not think 10
feet is very high but when you fall from it it sure seems like a far way.
Finally after everything was cleaned out and new stairs were built we got
the courage to try and climb those stairs again. When we got up there (we
were the first ones up there after the incident) everything was either
knocked over or in a totally different place. We don't know what happened
but we do believe a ghost was there. Amanda lives in the country so the
house may have been built on an indian war sight or even a cemetery. We
have'nt told anyone accept a few very close friends.</B>

<P><B>&nbsp; Hello There, recently a co-worker of mine had sent in a story
about our</B>
<BR><B>workplace i believe she titled it "presence at work"(?) she recommended</B>
<BR><B>that i send in my story to. I do customer service for the same isp.
the way</B>
<BR><B>it is laid out, Techs are on the 2nd floor, Customer service is
on the 1st.</B>
<BR><B>the 1st floor seems to be the nicer of the two</B>
<BR><B>we have more space, bigger break room etc... unlike tech supp. we
are not</B>
<BR><B>open 24-7 we close at 10pm..now on with my story usually on the
weekends</B>
<BR><B>nobody shows up for work. we're a big ISP Customer Service alone
has almost</B>
<BR><B>200 employees, but on the weekends at the most there is 15-20 agents
on the</B>
<BR><B>floor - one night about 5 months ago we had a dead q (no calls)
everybody</B>
<BR><B>was pretty much happy it's a rare ocassion</B>
<BR><B>that we don't have calls, as we are goofing off i was kneeling on</B>
<BR><B>on my desk talking to someone on the other side of the cubicle when
i</B>
<BR><B>looked over to my left and towards the back of the building theres
this</B>
<BR><B>little room with a sofa and a few chairs the light is always off
and very</B>
<BR><B>few people walk through there we have dubbed it the "nap room" anyway
i was</B>
<BR><B>looking in that direction&nbsp; when i noticed there was a man leaning
on the</B>
<BR><B>wall staring at me it sort of caught me off guard because he didn't
look</B>
<BR><B>too happy infact he looked down right pissed for some reason. i
guess</B>
<BR><B>another reason why it caught me off guard was because he was staring
right</B>
<BR><B>at me it almost looked like i had personally done something to him
and he</B>
<BR><B>was ploting my demise or something eventhough i had never laid eyes
on him</B>
<BR><B>before- i finally looked away-i commented to my friend to look at
him but</B>
<BR><B>when we looked back about two seconds later no one was there that
wasn't</B>
<BR><B>too strange because he could of gone into the nap room but thats
the only</B>
<BR><B>place he could've of gone into without us seeing him walk away.
i pushed it</B>
<BR><B>out of my head. at the end of my shift i went into the nap room
to use the</B>
<BR><B>phone, when i went to turn on the light it didn't turn on. it didn't
really</B>
<BR><B>bother me because there was enough light for me to dial. i sat down
to call</B>
<BR><B>my ride. in the process of the phone ringing i started to hear a
bunch of</B>
<BR><B>static i hung up and dialed again same thing happened then the phone
went</B>
<BR><B>dead i bent over and started messing with the cord</B>
<BR><B>when i saw a figure&nbsp; in the corner of the room it startled
me i gasped and</B>
<BR><B>gave a little laugh and said you scared me i didn't think anymore
was in</B>
<BR><B>here...the person was still in the corner just standing there, it
struck me</B>
<BR><B>as strange because i was looking right at them and the room wasn't
so dark</B>
<BR><B>i wouldn't be able to make out their features but this person was</B>
<BR><B>completely dark it was almost as i was looking at a shadow...i looked
down</B>
<BR><B>at the phone cord..all the sudden i felt this icy draft in the room
and i</B>
<BR><B>shivered i was about to say something when the person said "get
out" i</B>
<BR><B>can't really even describe the voice..it was like very mean and
angry i</B>
<BR><B>guess. i sorta just stood there for a minute it's like i couldn't
move then</B>
<BR><B>the lights came on i looked around and nobody was in the room..i
backed out</B>
<BR><B>of the room..to be honest i really didn't know what to think i used
the</B>
<BR><B>phone at the security desk to call my ride-and after a couple of
days that</B>
<BR><B>incident was pushed out of my head..one thing i would like to point
out is</B>
<BR><B>the nap room is located toward the back of the building where my
co-workers</B>
<BR><B>story took place-</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; another thing i know happened in that room, a friend
of mine on her</B>
<BR><B>lunch break went to go sleep her hangover off-she came back to me
about 45</B>
<BR><B>minutes later she had tears in her eyes she pulled me in the bathroon
and</B>
<BR><B>lifted up her shirt, she had scratches all over her they were fresh
and</B>
<BR><B>some were even bleeding alittle,she had them on her neck too. she
said that</B>
<BR><B>she was laying on the couch trying to get some rest</B>
<BR><B>(the couch just as a FYI is in the corner where i saw the figure
and is</B>
<BR><B>closest to the stairway) she said she started to hear a sound like
a low</B>
<BR><B>rumble almost like a growl, she tried to sit up but she realized
she</B>
<BR><B>couldn't move she said like 5 minutes later when she was able to
move she</B>
<BR><B>bolted out of the room as she was walking to my desk she felt the
scratches</B>
<BR><B>on her i had never told her what happened to me in that room until
she</B>
<BR><B>showed me the scratches. she quit because of what happened to her
she said</B>
<BR><B>she just didn't feel comfortable and felt like she was always being
watched-</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; One more thing to tell before i actually have to start
working. Last</B>
<BR><B>night i was working, it was Saturday and on the weekends we stay
open til</B>
<BR><B>midnight, i went to the bathroom, as i was washing my face i heard
a stall</B>
<BR><B>door sorta slam shut, it wasn't violent or anything it just sounded
like</B>
<BR><B>someone walked in there and pushed the door shut, i had thought
when i</B>
<BR><B>walked in i was by myself as i was in there for a good 7 minutes
messing</B>
<BR><B>with my hair and whatnot and i hadn't hear any noises that would
make me</B>
<BR><B>think otherwise, i walked to the end of the row and sorta checked
the</B>
<BR><B>stalls all of them were empty i got scared but i kept telling&nbsp;
myself</B>
<BR><B>whatever it was wasn't going to scare me so i continued to put my
make-up</B>
<BR><B>on and such about a minute later i heard a stall door creak open
proceeded</B>
<BR><B>by footsteps walked towards me&nbsp; i dropped everything and ran
out of there</B>
<BR><B>only to come back with a co-worker to get my belongings, i now use
the</B>
<BR><B>upstairs bathroom. that pretty much ends my story... much thanks
to the</B>

Three</B>

and</B>
<BR><B>the stairwell.</B>
<BR><B>Then, it got worse. Locked and chained doors would unlock and open
right</B>
<BR><B>before our eyes. Sometimes we would hear footsteps walking away
from our</B>
<BR><B>door and when we ran to see who was in the hallway there would be
no one.</B>
<BR><B>Before we moved out, objects would fly off the table, cabinets would
fly</B>
<BR><B>open, and a deep raspy voice would call or or whisper our names.</B>
<BR><B>Tenents living below could here footsteps in our apartment and once
we were</B>
<BR><B>with the tenents and heard footsteps paceing above us.</B>
<BR><B>We would hear the sound of walking and keys jingleing in the next
room, and</B>

<BR><B>I was at my friends dad's house, where an elderly man had died in
the bathroom from a heart attack.&nbsp; His dad told us of weird stuff
happening, but we figured he was just kidding.&nbsp; Until one night...</B>
<BR><B>When I was over at my best friends house, we were just hanging out
for a while.&nbsp; We got bored as usual and decided to play some computer
games.&nbsp; After being in their for maybe an hour and a half we heard
foot-steps come from his kitchen.&nbsp; We figured it might be his dad.&nbsp;
So we checked it out.&nbsp; We must have searched over 3 times.&nbsp; After
that we were trying to calm down and find a way to explain what had just
happened.&nbsp; Pretty soon our minds wandered off while watching a movie.&nbsp;
Then my friend told me to stop pulling his hair.&nbsp; I wasn't doing it
I told him.&nbsp; He didn't believe me of course.&nbsp; Then he said it
again.&nbsp; I thought he was making it up when the same thing happened
to me.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not long after my grandmother passed away
I was home alone watching TV. The phone rang. I answered. I heard low static
and then....heard my grandmother say, "Jimmy?"&nbsp;&nbsp; I answered and
said, "Yes." The static then became extremely loud. The feeling I got was
that something was trying to prevent her from speaking to me. I said her
name several times but just her asking my name was</B>
<BR><B>all I got.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wasn't scared. I thought it was kind

<BR><B>Phipps Street Cemetery is haunted by many ghost. One of which is
of a man hanging himself from a tree at the top of the hill. When my friends
and I took a picture of the tree in the flash we saw a face. We heard footsteps,
chains, banchee howl type of noise, and people talking. On the graves we
saw two sixes eroded from the grave stones. A friend and I felt a little
sick in the graveyard. We also felt uncontrollable chills throughout the
time. When we were leaving we dropped a notebook back down and the face
got snow on it but the back side was not at all wet. Grave stones appear
that were never there and also grave stones&nbsp; appear from a far distants
and when we walk over there there was nothing. We saw many apparitons in
between the stones, running around, and waving at us. We have also felt
fingers running up our arms and down our spine.</B>

<P><B>By: barina@2xtreme.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>I would like to tell a collection of my stories that have happened
to me over the years dealing with spirits and ghost. I remember my first
experience was when i was about five years old and i was sitting in my
house watching t.v. and out of the corner of my eye I saw a outline of
a man but it was pure white light and then the figure stopped at the end
of the hallway and looked at me for a second then preceded to go through
the door and that was the last that I saw of the spirit. My second experience
was in the same house that I lived in for eleven years and I was about
to go to sleep when all of a sudden the middle of the bed goes down like
there is alot of weight upon it but there was no one but me in the room.
Then after that before i got out of bed I felt an extremely cold chill
up my spine which i've never felt before. After that i usually slept in
the living room since I was afarid of my room and going to sleep in that
room. Although that didnt fix my problem I still would be haunted in the
living as well. One night I was sleeping on the couch when all of a sudden
it felt like I was laying on top of someone but I knew that no one was
there and this spirit but its arms around me and then preceeded to pass
through me which was a strange feeling and that was the end of that experience.
Also other time I was also sleeping on the couch and in the same house
I was sleeping and then it sounded like someone was walking from the bathroom
in the hallway to the living room and then stopped and in front of the
couch and started talking to someone. But I have never heard this voice
before and then I hear this spirit or whatever it was breathing dowm my
neck and I was scared so I sit up and it stops. So then I lay back down
and I hear it again and I even more scared so I jump up and I dont see
anything and I stay up and turn on the lights. I also have a stor involving
two cats of mine that passed away but years apart. My first cat died when
I was about 6 years old and I was sleeping and all of a sudden it feels
like a cat jumped on my bed and sat down but there was no cat in the room.
Then when I had to put my second cat to sleep after I had him for ten years,
and one night I was sleeping and I was dreaming and then all of a sudden
it felt like a cat jumped on my bed and touched my cheeck with its nose
but I knew that my cat had passed away. An other experience that I had
was that I was sleeping and then it felt like someone touched my shoulder
but it didnt feel like a human touch. Which kind of sounds weird to say
it felt like a ghost hand or something. Also one time I was in my background
when I saw this black but see though figure of an outline of a man and
then it disappeared. Most of my ghost experiences have happened in this
one house that I lived in for eleven years. I also had this strange experience
involving my dreams for example I was sleeping and I was having a dream
and in the end of the dream I was in a boat in the ocean and I fell out
somehow and then all of a sudden I was bitten in the stomach by a shark
but the weird thing is that I could actucally feel like in my phyiscal
body. Thats all the experiences that I can remember at the moment but it
seems like the hauntings always seem to happen to when I'm sleeping. Some
of my experiences I have not read in books that are similar to mine. But
I hope that this is a good story so enjoy!</B><B></B>

<P><B>Little Kitchen</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: bonew@bigpond.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Currently, we are renovating our home, and have to sleep at our grandparents
house. As a child I used to sleep in the back bedroom, in which the door
opens up into this tiny tiny kitchen. As a kid when I slept over there
I spent my nights sleepless. Why? Because I always heard noise in the kitchen.
This would be so loud, and I knew it was coming from the other side of
the bed. And this would be at 11 o'clock, midnight even, when everyone
was in bed. I used to hear old people talking, a drunken man yelling, and
pots and pans banging and clanging and the kettle whistling.</B>
<BR><B>No, that we are sleeping there again, I am clearly hearing the same
thing. It's weird because there's never any light coming from the kitchen,
just a loud ruckas!</B>
<BR><B>My grandparents house has been there for over a hundred years, and
my grandma was born in the house. Her parents lived there, as did her extended
family. Including the uncle who loved a drink of beer.</B>
<BR><B>No one beleives me and no one has ever beleived me. But I know that
my grandma's relatives are still there. Living their afterlife in this
house.</B><B></B>

<P><B>i was just writing to a new friend from the ectoplasm cafe when i
remembered</B>
<BR><B>a story i forgot to tell you!&nbsp; this was several years ago when
i was first</B>
<BR><B>married. we had (i think) a poltergeist. lots of fun activity. nothing</B>
<BR><B>harmful, just stuff missing or moved. well, my hubby, the non-believer,
was</B>
<BR><B>explaining all of it off. so one day i yelled "see this? he doesn't
believe</B>
<BR><B>you! show him you're here! make him believe you!".&nbsp; so....my
hubby goes to</B>
<BR><B>put a soda in the fridge to get it cold. he comes back through the
dining</B>
<BR><B>room and into the living room. i get up, walk out into the kitchen
for a</B>
<BR><B>drink of water, and come back to the living room. then he goes back
into the</B>
<BR><B>kitchen after a bit to get his soda. he yells "why did you put my
soda in</B>
<BR><B>the freezer?".&nbsp; i told him i didn't do it. we were in the living
room-all of</B>
<BR><B>us. the kids couldn't reach the freezer and noone else was over.
he swears</B>
<BR><B>to this day that i did it. i told him someone was trying to get
him to</B>
<BR><B>notice them! but this isn't all.....he goes back into the kitchen
for some</B>
<BR><B>chips. you know how sometimes the bag rips down the side when you
open it? i</B>
<BR><B>told him not to make a mess. he got bored with the chips and put
them back</B>
<BR><B>into the kitchen, on top of the fridge. he comes back into the living
room</B>
<BR><B>and i go out into the kitchen to start supper.&nbsp; i scream "why
did you give</B>
<BR><B>the dog the chips?" (the back door was right there and there was
no screen.</B>
<BR><B>the dog was chained right outside). hubby comes out and stands in
amazement.</B>
<BR><B>i didn't give the dog the chips. the cats must've. so i point out
that if,</B>
<BR><B>indeed, this is true then 1- the cats would've had to jump from
the floor to</B>
<BR><B>the top of the fridge (do-able i guess)&nbsp; 2- the cats would've
kept the chips</B>
<BR><B>to themselves&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3- the bag was ripped so there should've
been crumbs all</B>
<BR><B>over&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4- if they wanted to share with the
dog, they would've had to carry</B>
<BR><B>the bag (while spilling crumbs) over to the door, reach up to the
opening,</B>
<BR><B>and thrown the chips a few feet out to reach the dog. i was laughing
and</B>
<BR><B>said "putting the truth right in front of you and you still try
to explain</B>
<BR><B>it off!".&nbsp; he still would not believe that we had a "friend"
living with us!</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; my son (my girl wasn't born yet) loved it! except when he
couldn't find a</B>
<BR><B>toy!&nbsp; now for a question....i have smelled flowers before when
there were no</B>
<BR><B>flowers or people with perfume on around me. some have told me this
is an</B>
<BR><B>omen of a coming death in the family. others have told me it's an
angel or</B>
<BR><B>divine spirit. what do you think or know about this?&nbsp; i've
been smelling</B>
<BR><B>lilacs alot lately.&nbsp; my mom loves lilacs and she has two BIG
bushes out</B>
<BR><B>behind her house. i remember their house during the spring growing
up. the</B>
<BR><B>lilacs, tulips and daffodils were amazing! i would lay in bed at
nite</B>
<BR><B>smelling the glorious scent drifting in on the warm spring breeze
through my</B>
<BR><B>window. i think grandma (mom's mom) liked them alot too. i think
i remember</B>
<BR><B>mom saying she put some lilacs in the casket with grandma when she
died. the</B>
<BR><B>story i told you about where me and my brother were talking about
grandma</B>
<BR><B>after she died and he smelled lilacs while i went numb.&nbsp; remember?&nbsp;
i was</B>
<BR><B>thinking, my mom is really not well lately and maybe grandma is
letting me</B>
<BR><B>know that either mom's ok cause she's watching or maybe she's going
to take</B>
<BR><B>mom "home" soon. or maybe it's an angel letting me know that they're
there</B>
<BR><B>to let me know that they have mom covered</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Just me and the Boy</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: MMagus972@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I know this is like any other ghost story, but I'd like to share
it anyway.</B>
<BR><B>When I was growing up in my old house in Moorestown, NJ, I was always
freaked out by the weird occurances in my house. I used to sit in my room,
playing games or something, and I would feel a weird presence, like the
room getting exceptionally cold. I would close my door and go back to playing.
Then It would slowly open. Well I thought this was because the door was
old, but I after a while, I became scared because it kept happening. Then
my sister moved up into my freaky attic. Since I was up there much more
now, I started noticing the same thing happening in my attic as in my room.
At night you could hear muffled sounds of doors opening and supposedly
footsteps. Then one night, I suddenly awoke, I was really cold, and I could
feel an unormal presence. I looked up and saw the most scary thing in my
life. A full grown man was standing there, staring right at me. I was so
scared I fainted back into a deep sleep.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then over the years,
the normal occurences were happening. I thought I was going insane, because
I was actually yelling at the ghost to leave me alone. I asked my mom who
lived in this house last. My mom said it was a familiy with the dad in
the army. He went to war ( I think Vietnam) he was killed. Thats when I
started to believe myself. I told my friend about the night with the ghost.
So as usual boys do, we went on many ghost hunts. Well we got are share
of scares, but found no evidence.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then my family
moved across town, and life went on. But about a half a year later, the
houses new owners told me of how they to, had an encounter. The mother
was at home with her son, like me, the only son. He was playing upstairs,
and everything seemed normal. Then he came downstairs and she asked what
was he doing. He said "I was talking to the man upstairs". Like any mother
she was freaked out and made sure everything was locked. Not a window or
door was open.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is quite unusual
that this ghost would show himslef just to the boy and me. Not one person
but my sister believes me. I hope you do though.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Horses and Carriages</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Immunexxxx@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hello, My name is Thomas and I live with my wife in a historic district
of North Hill street and Broad street in, Georgia. We live in renovated
two story building that was built in the 1860's and was a old pharmacy
on the bottom floor for years. The building sits on the corners of North
Hill and Broad streets. Here's what I've got..... I have heard the sound
of horse hooves hitting the pavement with the sound of a carriage or buggie
being pull behind it. The sound comes from the 8th street direction, I
have heard this several times at early hours of the morning. The horse
whinnies usally two times and sounds like a fast walk as it pulls the carriage.
I hear the carriage rattle and wheels move down the street and in the same
direction everytime. It starts around 8th street and Broad and continues
past my house at Hill and Broad, then on down Broad toward the old court
house. On my recent research outings I found out that directly across the
street from my house on Hill street was a carriage company. They build
and serviced carriages until the early 1900's. On the many occations that
I have heard this I have ran around the house and looking out the windows
only to see nothing, But still hearing the horse and buggie. On one occastion,
I have ran downstairs to the foyer, opened the door and heard nor saw nothing.
Shortly after that started happining I heard an old man talking as he walked
down Broad street, comming from the old court house direction. I have only
heard this two times. I'm not sure, but he sounds like an old black man,
and he slurs his words as if he is intoxicated. My wife has heard this
man once with me and the other time she was asleep. We have never seen
him either. But the two never happen on the same night or week. Go figure.
I have never believed in ghosts or apparitions, but this has made me feel
different. Can you please post this on you site under the "ghosts" section
so others will know. Thanks,</B><B></B>

<P><B>Here is my Ghost Story</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: hotkoko</B><B></B>

<P><B>ok. here is my ghost story.&nbsp; we first noticed it when we moved
in to our new house in canada. things started happening when we began to
add on to the house, and discovered old things, like a train pass, several
150 year old newspapers.first there was a smell like something dead. then
at christmas time, my dad took a picture of me, my sister and my dog in
front of the christmas tree. when it was developed, we found an orb also
know as a spirit partical shaped in thr form of a circle. other people
think its a energy sphere. Anyway, next,&nbsp; my sister was staying up
late by herself when the computer turned on. the computer was new at the
time. i have had many experiences with the supernatural, and im only 12
and a half. when i was 5 years old, i slept by myself in a big room. every
night, i would have the same dream. i would be awake in bed when a voice
from my window would yell and scream at me. it would command me to do things.
sometimes i talked back to it, not taking the orders. other times i would
hide under my covers, away from the horrible voice. and to this day, i
wonder if it really was a dream, or if it was real. and why would it be
every night that i would have the same dream? what did the voice want me
to do? it told me to leave it alone sometimes. other times it told me to
kill or be killed. i never did what it told me to do thankfully. those
are only some of the occering events here at my house. they dont happen
as often now. and i wonder if it will ever stop for good...</B><B></B>

<BR><B>have had a handfull of strange happening's, this is</B>
<BR><B>the one i have been thinking about the most lately,</B>
<BR><B>since finding this web site it has got me thinking to</B>
<BR><B>the past.&nbsp; in the late 80's, me and a friend went for</B>
<BR><B>a walk, we ended up in the old town part of hastings,</B>
<BR><B>not much to do so we decide to go to the east of the</B>
<BR><B>old town, a few hundred yards and we were heading up</B>
<BR><B>towards the east hill. the east hill is a nature like</B>
<BR><B>walk plenty of grass and woods, but also a cliff runs</B>
<BR><B>to the side which the beach can be reached from steps.</B>
<BR><B>we ended up on the beach, not warm anough to bathe and</B>
<BR><B>no people around. we sat at the bottom of the cliff's</B>
<BR><B>talking. i was talking but looking around at the same</B>
<BR><B>time, the corner of my left eye caught sight at the</B>
<BR><B>top of part of the cliff, i saw some blurred figure it</B>
<BR><B>looked small it was tumbling from the top of the</B>
<BR><B>cliff, it faded as it fell i was stunned but it was</B>
<BR><B>not a person, just something a bit freaky. my friend</B>
<BR><B>did not see it, nothing said to much after. anyway the</B>
<BR><B>next day [something i found out a few days later] a</B>
<BR><B>good friend of mine who i had not seen for a couple of</B>
<BR><B>months, commited suicide from the cliffs we had been</B>
<BR><B>to the previous day, but i do not know the exact part</B>
<BR><B>of the cliffs.&nbsp; a few months later in the summer, i</B>
<BR><B>was walking less than a mile from the cliffs to the</B>
<BR><B>west, a built up and busy tourist part of town the</B>
<BR><B>main beach and prom, it was a hot dark summers night</B>
<BR><B>walking past the prom i looked on the beach and saw my</B>
<BR><B>friend who jumped from the cliffs standing on the</B>
<BR><B>beach, he looked fine but much much taller.</B>

<P><B>Ghosts</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: andreasbigpapa@msn.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I like to call this story a lock and unlock mystery. I just came
home from school. It is now 6:00 p.m. and I took a shower. I got out of
the shower( Not out the door of course!). I tried to get out the door but
somehow I couldn't get out. I checked to see if it was locked. It was unlocked.
I kept thinking "how?". I finally got out. I went to bed at 8:00 p.m. I
woke up in the middle of the night, seeing somebody standing at my bedroom
door. At first I thought it was my mom. Then the sight became clear. Some
bloody male in sight. It disappeared. The next day I was home alone. I
turned on the television. I heard breathing sounds. I muted the T.V. Still
breathing sounds. I held my breath and again I heard breathing sounds.
The door closed on me! I opened it. I was scared! All the candles started
to flicker. Everything stopped. I was okay. It was over. That was my story.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Ghosts or my Imagination</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: dracone1@earthlink.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>I would like to tell you a story about what I think were ghosts in
the house I was living in.&nbsp; I don't know much history about the house,
but the landlord had told me it was over a hundred years old.&nbsp; My
fiancee', three children and I were so excited about this house.&nbsp;
It was huge.&nbsp; There were two bedrooms downstairs, two bathrooms in
the house, two bedrooms upstairs and a basement that was almost as large
as the first floor.&nbsp; The second night we were there, my youngest son,
Walker (he was three at the time) began crying.&nbsp; I went into the bedroom
designated as the boys room.&nbsp; It was so cold in there.&nbsp; I knelt
down beside him and began rubbing his hair trying to soothe him.&nbsp;
I closed my eyes because I was so tired.&nbsp; I got a chill down my back
and all I could picture was a coffin the that room.&nbsp; The boys began
staying in the room we were using for a den.&nbsp; We had a couch in there
and it suited them fine.&nbsp; I never told them what I had felt in that
room.&nbsp; A few days later I had invited my mom over to show her around.&nbsp;
Once again we went into the boys room and the same thing happened, only
my mother felt the same coldness in there.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She told me
that something didn't feel right.&nbsp; Now my older son, Travis, (he was
4 at the time) was totally potty trained.&nbsp; He began wetting his pants
all the time.&nbsp; I asked him why he was doing that.&nbsp; His response
was "a mean voice tells me to get out when I go in there mommy"&nbsp; I
had no reason to disbelieve him.&nbsp; Not one single child would go into
the restroom without someone going with them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This continued
for some time.&nbsp; My daughter had a bedroom upstairs across the hall
from outs.&nbsp; I could hear her talking to someone but when I walked
in nobody was there.&nbsp; She had never made any reference to an "invisible
friend" in her entire life.&nbsp; I asked her who she was talking to and
she replied that lady over there and pointed to her closet.&nbsp; I told
her to come downstairs with me.&nbsp; We decided to move her bedroom downstairs
into the den.&nbsp; Now all of a sudden none of the kids would walk into
another room without someone going with them.&nbsp; It was like whatever
was scaring them was taking over the house.&nbsp; One evening the kids
were spending the night at their grandpas house and I started up the stairs
to go to bed.&nbsp; I saw a white figure on the stairs.&nbsp; I think it
was a lady because it looked like she was wearing a dress.&nbsp; I ran
back into the living room and slept on the couch until my fiancee came
home.&nbsp; I didn't want to tell anyone because I thought everyone would
think I was crazy.&nbsp; One night I was upstairs and my fiancee was home.&nbsp;
I went to open our closet door and I swear I saw a mans head hanging in
there.&nbsp; I screamed and my fiancee came running, but he didn't see
anything.&nbsp; This continued, only the same head was in every closet
door I opened.&nbsp; The kids room, the hallway closet, in the kitchen
everywhere.&nbsp; I had my fiancee take all the clothes out of the closets
so I didn't have to open them anymore.&nbsp; As usual I was home alone
again since my fiancee worked well into the night.&nbsp; I heard a voice
telling me some really scary things.&nbsp; This voice told me that my daughter
was going to die by falling down the steps.&nbsp; It told me my son, Travis
was going to die in the bathtub downstairs.&nbsp; My youngest son was going
to die by being hung from a chain we had to turn the light on in the upstairs
bathroom.&nbsp; I was petrified.&nbsp; I wasn't sure if I was going crazy
and hearing things in my head or if it was real.&nbsp; Let me tell you
I now believe it was real.&nbsp; My kids ran up and down the stairs all
the time.&nbsp; The day after this voice spoke to me, my daughter fell
down the steps.&nbsp; She wasn't hurt, but she told me it felt like someone
had pushed her and she was the only one upstairs at the time.&nbsp; Finally
I broke down and told my mom what had been going on.&nbsp; We decided that
for now the kids would be safer staying with my sister at night.&nbsp;
I just told my sister that some things were going on I couldn't explain
and I needed the kids to stay with her.&nbsp; No problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I was on my way upstairs again when I looked up (which I had been trying
not to do.&nbsp; I would just look at the steps as I walked up them.) and
there was a man with a knife at the top of the steps.&nbsp; I backed down
the stair slowly and again slept on the couch.&nbsp; My radio by my bed
would go from low to high when the radio was on.&nbsp; I would be asleep
when this happened.&nbsp; One afternoon before it was time to take my kids
to my sisters house, I walked from the kitchen into the dining room.&nbsp;
My daughter was sitting on the couch and looked at me funny.&nbsp; I asked
her what was wrong.&nbsp; She said "Mom there is a women standing behind
you."&nbsp; I turned and no one was there.&nbsp; We had a hook at the top
our door to the basement.&nbsp; It was so high that I couldn't hardly reach
it so I know the kids couldn't.&nbsp; The door would be opened all the
time.&nbsp; I would latch it and a hour later it was open again.&nbsp;
Another evening I was in bed sleeping when I heard my name being called.&nbsp;
Not mommy because the kids weren't there, but my name.&nbsp; I knew nobody
was there because&nbsp; the doors were locked and my fiancee was at home.&nbsp;
He never came home early.&nbsp; If it had been him he would have came upstairs
to let me know he was there.&nbsp; A couple days later I was at my moms
house and I began to cry.&nbsp; The terrifying feeling I had at the house
was there too.&nbsp; I had never been afraid at my parents house before.&nbsp;
I told her I was hearing voice that told me even though I thought whatever
it was stayed at my house, it didn't.&nbsp; It told me it followed me everywhere.&nbsp;
I told my mom I thought I should going crazy and maybe I should sign myself
into a stress center.&nbsp; She drove me home and waited with me until
my fiancee came home.&nbsp; It wasn't long after that my uncle bought us
a trailer to move into.&nbsp; He said he thought I would feel better in
a new place.&nbsp; After we moved in here, my son stopped wetting his pants,
all the kids began sleeping through the night, and there were no more "sightings"&nbsp;
I don't know to this day if I was slowly going crazy or if I really did
see something.&nbsp; I just wanted to share this with you.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Ghost..</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>By: smurfette_30111@hotmail.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;You know how on the site you say that ghosts will try to contact
through dreams? Well I'm 17 now but when I was 11 my grandfather died.
About a week after he died I had a dream that we were redoing his house,
because my family did to sell it, and he was sitting there beside me. I
asked him if I was the only one who could see him and he said yes. I asked
him why he was there, and he said that he wanted to tell me that he is
alright and that he is doing ok where is he now. So, I guess ghosts really
do try to contact you in your dreams.</B><B></B>
