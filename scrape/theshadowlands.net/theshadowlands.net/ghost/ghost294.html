<p><b>KY ghost</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: MommaBear8284@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My name is Terri and my son is Tom.&nbsp;&nbsp;
On 1-31-04, his car broke down on Palatka Road near Iroquois Park.&nbsp;
He was leaning under the hood on the drivers side (by the tire) when he
felt a cold sensation on his right side.&nbsp; Thinking it was only cold
air going up his shirt, he ignored it.&nbsp; It continued and then gripped
his side.&nbsp; With that, he turned around to see a man.&nbsp; He described
a man in his 40's who had a mustache.&nbsp; He said the man had "kind eyes".&nbsp;
Thinking the man was there to help him, my son started to say something.&nbsp;
It was then he noticed that he could see through the man and the trees
of the park beyond.&nbsp; My son said that with that realization, the man
suddenly vanished.&nbsp; My son slammed down the hood of his car, got in
the car and noticed that the car was no longer overheated.&nbsp; It was
now cold, and would start.&nbsp; He came home and told me of the experience.&nbsp;
We researched on the web, looking for accident victims, thinking maybe
someone was killed in the area having similar car trouble.&nbsp; Having
no luck, we researched murder victims.&nbsp; It was then that we found
an article relating to a man who was murdered while helping a friend.&nbsp;
Before the article photo fully loaded, my son said "that's the man I saw!"&nbsp;
I tried to reason with him that the half loaded picture could be the reporter
of the story...imagine my surprise when the caption below the man listed
him as a victim of murder....The man was known to "tinker" with cars in
his spare time.....Coincidence?&nbsp; I am not sure, but I know that my
son has been permanently changed as a result of this.</b>
<br><b>Thanks!</b>

<p><b>Late Night Haunting?</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Niknik74@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>hello again . i was reading some more of the ghost stories i guess
i like being scared. the most scariest one was about the boy in the Jesus
picture , i couldn't sleep forweeks. anyway i read about someones grandma
felt something and i remebered my encounter late one night.when i was 18
i stayed with my aunt (didn't want to move out of town) my aunt owns a
four&nbsp; bedroom split level house with a basement.my cousin and i had
rooms downstairs. the basement door was right across the hall from my room(which
had a door to the backyard) and my cousins door was at the foot of the
stairs down the hall from mine. i have always loved scary movies so i slept
with my blankets tucked under my feet.( so monsters couldn't grab them)
sometimes in my sleep i would feel like someone was pulling the covers
off my feet and i would wake up . so this night i had went to sleep and
i remember waking up because i felt like someone was laying on top of me
on my right side. the pressure was so heavy i couldn't move or yell or
anything. then it felt like it was humping my leg. so i freaked out and
tried to punch what ever it was but&nbsp; i couldn't move i remeber trying
to yell but i could not hear any sound so i just prayed . i prayed the
Our Father prayer and instantly it went away. i flew out of bed and down
the hall to my cousins room. i banged on her door and she let me in. needless
to say i slept in her room for&nbsp; weeks. then last summer i was listening
to the radio and a woman called in the story she told the docter was exactly
what i went through. it brought chills down my spine. he called them night
terrors(when we dream that were awake and because its dark we think were
awake but were not) i dont care what he says i was awake how else could
i have prayed?this also happened to my friend and to me once before tho
not that extreme. i am honestly telling the truth , that was so terrifiying
to me.</b>

<br><b>&nbsp;4/9/04</b>
<br><b>~Me, my fiance, and my fiances brother traveled to this cemetery
to visit an ancestors gravesite. We arrived there around 6pm. We traveled
throughout the cemetery to see the rest of the nice gravestones, but my
fiance noticed a light in an unoccupied white shed. Noone was working the
grounds of the cemetery at this time and we were alone, but when my fiance
saw this light, we noticed at this time that something strange was happening.
The light was on for about a minute and 30 seconds then the light went
off for about five minutes in which it went on again for about 30 seconds.
Then it went off and stayed off. On the way out of the cemetery, we felt
strange negative energy/presence and had the feeling of not being welcomed.
At this moment we were spiritually attacked and we could feel them charging
after us, telling us to get out. We started feeling numbness, partial convulsion
symptoms, tension, butterflies in stomach, weakness, internal organs hurting,
migraine headaches, pain in neck/whiplash,&nbsp; partial paralysis of the
left side of body, slight nausea, in which lasted of about an hour to about
2 hours, In which after the 2 hours we were back to our normal selves.
We feel that this places is haunted and not safe for the unspiritually
intuned.</b>

<p><b>Looking After the Family</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: DERBUBBIE@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hello my name is Deborah. I would like to tell my story, i have had
and still have, a spirit that is with me. but ffor some reason I believe
that it is my father, but i do know it is a man. i heard it when it cries.
my doorbell would ring every day at 8:30 am and 8;30 PM and when i look
out the window there is one there. but i do feel as though someone is looking
at me. when i'm in my bedroom i always hear walking in the back in my living
room. i have a very long hallway in my apartment and when i get ready to
go the bathroom or towards the back of the house. i always see a shadow
but when it see's me it disappears. and this spirit has came with me to
my every moving when i moved. one night i just closed my eyes no i wasn't
sleep, but while my eyes were closed slightly i seen a white form of light
in my eyes and my eyes were closed slightly. i couldn't make out what the
light was, but it seem very strange for the reason i had my eyes closed
and this form of bright white light appeared within my eyes while my eyes
were closed. at night i smell a strong scent of flowers, and also i hear
lite tapping on the back of my headboard. and i say to this whatever it
maybe. i say i know you are here. and in all i was dealing with this man
and my smoke alarm would always go off all times of the night when this
man was living here. and i would get up and go to the back of the house
to see if there was&nbsp; anything wrong, and it was never nothing wrong.
so one day i just gotten a ladder and i checked the smoke alarm to see
if it was the battery but there was no battery i found out my smoke alarm
was electric. and eventually this man robbed my whole house.and since this
man is no loner living here the smoke alarm have not went off since. and
i checked it to see if it still works and it does, i believe my spirit
was trying to warn me of this man. i believe this spirit is looking over
me and my sons, thats why i believe it is my father. because one day a
3 year old boy came into my house and this boy said to me Miss Deborah
there is a man sittingon your toilet, and he came back the next day and
told me the man was now in my litchen waving hello to him. if it is my
father or who ever i would like to put it to rest. people told me to talk
to it. but i'm afraid i will get and answer.people think i'm crazy when
i tell them this. but i'm not crazy my son even witness these things i'm
teling you. one day i was playing the radio and this spirit just started
turning the dial to other stations and me and my sons just looked at each
other and told the spirit to turn the radio back to what the station it
was on. we cursed it and it left. for awhile that is. one day i was coming
into the building and at my back door to the hallway part i saw a shadow
of a man with a gray suit come from out the corner of the hallway and as
i was proceeding to put my key in my room door i just stood there looking
in astonishment. but i believed it was my father because it was the build
of my father and we buried my father in the year of 1974 in a gray suit
white shirt and a gray tie.but as i said i believe this spirit is looking
over me and my family. i have other altercations with spirits that i did
not mention.</b>

<br><b>My Experience</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: TheVenuss@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>Location:&nbsp; Auburn Washington,</b><b></b>
<p><b>My boyfriend at the time and my&nbsp; 3 year old daughter moved into
this apartment July of 1998.&nbsp; I didn't notice anything right away
and of course if something strange did happen I would play it off as my
eyes or my mind was playing tricks with me.</b>
<br><b>I really don't know where to start It however things did progress
over time.</b>
<br><b>My computer desk was in the dining room up against the wall.&nbsp;
In the corner a brown spot appeared on the tile on the floor.&nbsp; We
would mop it and it would appear again after a while.&nbsp; We owned a
cat we nicknamed "crack kitty" because it would take off tearing out of
the room acting as if something would chase it. (Its litter box and food
was in the dining room).</b>
<br><b>I'm not sure if my boyfriend at the time noticed anything strange.&nbsp;
I had brothers and sisters stay the night and they would get creeped out
and say that they'd see things over by the dining room.&nbsp; My daughter
also didn't like staying at the apartment.</b>
<br><b>My boyfriend at the time was a former dj and owned many electronic
equipment.&nbsp; We had huge speakers we used as end tables.&nbsp; They
were extremely dead, and had no cords anymore.&nbsp; One night I was sittin
in the living room relaxing and I heard static and a muffled mans voice
talking fast and it cut out quick.&nbsp; I couldn't understand what he
said, but he definately was a man.&nbsp; Thats when I called him buddy.</b>
<br><b>I would be sittin at my computer playing computer games late at
night, and I'll feel a gust of wind in my face, which smelled like stale
man breath.&nbsp; He would try to get my attention by doing crazy stuff
like knocking pictures off the wall,&nbsp; knocking window fans out of
the window,&nbsp; knock things off of shelves,&nbsp; he even knocked over
one of them huge heavy economy sized packages of cat food sending cat food
everywhere.</b>
<br><b>He must have not liked my boyfriend because he would do things to
annoy him (which I would get in trouble for)&nbsp; My boyfriend at the
time would always hit his bald head on the corner of cabinet doors when
left open.&nbsp; One day I was on my computer in the dining room and he
walked into the kitchen hit his head on the cabinet and yelled at me for
it.&nbsp; He slammed the cabinet door shut and went into the other room
as i continued to play on the computer telling him that I didn't do it
and that he must have forgot and left it open.&nbsp; He came back into
the kitchen to yell at me some more and every single cabinet door and shelf
door was open.&nbsp; I hadn't heard it or even left my computer to complete
such a task in such a short amount of time.&nbsp; Of course the boyfriend
figured I was just doing that to test him.</b>
<br><b>The bathroom light would flicker one day and be completely fine
the next.&nbsp; There was always a strange tapping sound coming from the
wall in my daughters closet.</b>
<br><b>A few instances which made me realize that perhaps we needed to
find somewhere else to live..</b>
<br><b>We have a strict rule that the cat was not allowed in the rooms
and in order to enforce that we would have to keep all the bedroom doors
closed.&nbsp; I was tucking my daughter into bed one night and closed the
door of her room.&nbsp; I saw the cat in the hallway and went into my room
and closed the door.&nbsp; My daughter and I slept against the wall that
seperated our rooms.&nbsp; I did that so I can hear her if she needed me.&nbsp;
I heard my daughter sit up in her bed, so I got up to check on her as I
opened the door she had this look of terror in her eyes and whimpered that
the cat was in her room.&nbsp;&nbsp; How the cat got in there puzzles me
til this day as if my daughter had opened up her bedroom door and closed
it again I would have definatly heard that.&nbsp; That was the last night
my daughter spent in that apartment,&nbsp; she would talk of the "devil"
coming to her at night and having nightmares and such.&nbsp; I allowed
her to stay at my mothers house a few miles away.</b>
<br><b>Near the end of my stay in that apartment things started to get
a little more creepy and more disturbing.&nbsp; At night as i worked my
way to my bedroom turning off lights I felt like someone watched me from
the dining room making my way towards my room.&nbsp; The feeling was so
creepy that I told myself "dont turn around stupid"&nbsp; I swear I haven't
seen buddy's form but If I did,&nbsp; I think i would have had a heart
attack.</b>
<br><b>The last straw..</b>
<br><b>I was sitting in my dining room playing on my computer and I heard
a tap coming from the floor.. it was subtle at first and I ignored it as
the apartment was settling.&nbsp; then it got louder and louder, sounding
like someone was knocking on the floor trapped underneath it.&nbsp; At
the climax the banging was so loud and strong that my chair and area in
the dining room was bouncing.. I jumped out of my chair and ran to my room
and tried to wake my boyfriend who just rolled over and slept.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I went back out in the dining room and continued with my game.</b>
<br><b>We eventually moved exactly 3 years to the day in July of 2001 to
a bigger apartment.</b>
<br><b>For years I've wondered if what I experienced was for real or if
I was crazy.&nbsp; I wonder what events could have occured at that location.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I wonder if anyone who's lived there knows about the history or has experienced
the same.</b>
<br><b>The apartment complex itself is right next to the Green River in
Auburn.&nbsp; My apartment itself probably sets about 200 feet off the
river bank.&nbsp; Perhaps back in the day when settlers followed the river
to get them places and their sick died or they were attacked by indians
or something grisly happend.&nbsp; They perhaps buried them off the river?&nbsp;
The knocking on the floor made me think that perhaps "buddy" is burried
underneath the diningroom.&nbsp; The apartments are one story.&nbsp; We
have no downstairs or upstairs neighbors.</b>
<br><b>I certainly would love to find out the story about that place and
that area.</b>
<br><b>Hopefully my story could be of some use.</b><b></b>

in the kitchen went off about ten minutes ago, it sounded like your music,

<p><b>The Moving Swan</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: marconuttingo@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I live in a subourb area just outside Birmingham, England. We moved
to our</b>
<br><b>house in 1994, when i was only 7 years old. An old lady died while
having a</b>
<br><b>bath, 2 years before we moved in. Its only over the last 2 years
that i have</b>
<br><b>experienced 'weird happenings'. The first being that taps turn on,
by there</b>
<br><b>own, at first i thought it was a problem with the boiler or water
works, but</b>
<br><b>even when i squeezed the tap nob tight, i always came back later
on to find</b>
<br><b>it loose and running. I find it coincidental how the old lady had
died in</b>
<br><b>the bathroom where the taps turn on. At first it 'freaked' me out,
but i got</b>
<br><b>used to it. But, soon the unexplainable happened,.</b>
<br><b>We had this 'scary' looking antique swan that sits by the bath.
We found it</b>
<br><b>under the sink when we moved in and my mom fought it would be nice.
About</b>
<br><b>9:30 pm one night(cant remember when), i was having a shower, and
when i</b>
<br><b>opened my eyes, fear struck me when the swan was more or less next
to me</b>
<br><b>staring at me, i was scared stiff, i shouted my younger brother
and asked</b>
<br><b>him if he was playing a sick joke, but he, who was also freaked
out, sed he</b>
<br><b>didnt. None of my family had moved it. It was a tuesday night, about
4:00</b>
<br><b>am, when there was a violent banging on the bathroom door, i refused
at</b>
<br><b>first and froze stiff in bed, i got up and opened my door, and the
banging</b>
<br><b>stopped, i called my mom and she opened the bathroom door, to find
the swan</b>
<br><b>at the foot of the door, that was it, i had continueous nightmares
about it</b>
<br><b>and eventually moved into my dads house until my mom finally got
rid of the</b>
<br><b>swan.</b>
<br><b>I dont know why the hell the swan moved, it definately was not my
family,</b>
<br><b>the only reasonable explanation was the old ladys ghost, moving
it and</b>
<br><b>playing around with taps.Or some other phenomenon. There have been
no</b>
<br><b>paranormal activity since the swan has gone.</b><b></b>

<p><b>The Voices</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: LeezaBell@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>The story I am going to tell you is a true story that happened to
my daughter Christy in our home.&nbsp; We bought our house in Central Florida
in August 1993, and we have lived there over 10 years.&nbsp; It's just
your average 4-bedroom, 2-bath, one story house.&nbsp; It was a rental
house before we bought it so several families lived in it before we bought
it.&nbsp; My daughter was diagnosed with A.D.H.D. (attention deficit hyperactivity
disorder) in 5th grade and had difficult time with school.&nbsp; She was
constantly fighting with me, my husband and her little brother.&nbsp; She
reached her "teen years" and thought that she didn't have to listen to
us anymore.&nbsp; We were going through some pretty hard times with her
behavior problems.</b>
<br><b>This incident happened in February 2003, and Christy was 16-years
old.&nbsp; We made the kids go to bed at 9:00 pm during the week because
they had to get up early for school. After they went to bed, I was constantly
telling Christy to turn down her radio &amp; turn off her light. She had
a hard time going to sleep and an even harder time getting up at 6:00 am
to get ready for school.&nbsp; I went into her room one night to tell her
to turn down the radio &amp; go to sleep and she said "Mom, I need to talk
to you."&nbsp; I said okay &amp; sat down on her bed.&nbsp; She was reluctant
to tell me what was wrong but finally she did.&nbsp; She said that the
reason she keeps her radio up loud &amp; her light on is because for the
past several months, she hears voices when she turns them off and tries
to go to sleep.&nbsp; I asked her if she could tell what the voices were
saying and she said it sounded like several people talking but she couldn't
tell what they were saying.&nbsp; I said "Let's say a prayer to God that
he will make it stop" so we did.&nbsp; I was a little freaked out to say
the least.&nbsp; Not really sure if I should believe her or not but I could
tell that something was really bothering her.&nbsp; During this time, my
son would not stay in his bed at night.&nbsp; He would wait until my husband
and I were asleep &amp; sneak into our room.&nbsp; He never mentioned anything
in particular happening to him, even when I asked.&nbsp; He was just scared
to sleep alone.</b>
<br><b>I asked Christy the next day if she had heard anything that night
after our prayer and she said no.&nbsp; Unfortunately, it didn't last long.
The next night, the voices started again and she said they were mad at
her for telling me. Christy told me that the voices came closer to her
this time.&nbsp; She said that a voice was right beside her ear and told
her to go get a knife from the kitchen and at the same time, she saw a
vision of my husband, myself &amp; my son stabbed to death in our beds.&nbsp;
We always sleep with our bedroom door open so that we could hear the kids
if they needed us. She came into my bedroom crying and was visibly shaking.&nbsp;
I told her she could sleep with us.&nbsp; These voices were bothering her
every night, telling her the same thing, get a knife and kill your family.</b>
<br><b>The following week, Christy took a pair of scissors that were in
her bedroom and cut her writs.&nbsp; She said she was tired of figting
the voices and wanted to take her own life.&nbsp; I did not know that she
had done this until the Police showed up at my door at 11:30 pm.&nbsp;
She had called a friend and told him what she had done and he in turn called
the police.&nbsp; They took her to a mental facility for a mandatory 5-day
stay.&nbsp; They put her on medication for the "voices" and said she was
suffering from depression.&nbsp; The doctor said the voices were "in her
head" and obviously wouldn't consider any other possibility.&nbsp; She
stopped taking the medication when she came home and started attending
church on a regular basis.&nbsp; She was baptised and since then, have
had no other problems with the evil voices.</b>
<br><b>I truly believe that these voices were evil forces preying on someone
that they saw as a weak person.&nbsp; They sensed that she had some emotional
problems and were trying to get her to do evil things.&nbsp; I thank God
for his protection and am a believer that evil can be defeated.&nbsp; All
we have to do is ask.&nbsp; If anyone else has had any experience like
this, please feel free to e-mail me.</b>

<p><b>Sleep Over</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Beardlesskat@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hi, just wanted to share my recent paranormal experience. I will
start by saying that until five months ago i did not believe in Ghosts
or an after life, but what has happened to me has changed my mind completely.
I am currently living in a 100+ year old house and have done for the past
fifteen years, and I always felt that I lived in a safe and very *unhaunted*
house, hence my not believing in the paranormal. About 5 months ago i agreed
to let my daughter have friends over to stay for the night. They were two
girls, both 14, lets say their names were charlotte and kerry. It was about
two o'clock in the morning when I was woken by my daughter who told me
that her friends were crying and that they wanted to go home. At first
I thought they must have had a falling out (as many teenage girls do),
so i went down to try to sort things out. I asked the girls why they were
crying and Charlotte said that she had just seen her grandfather in my
daughters bedroom watching them sleep, however her grandfather had been
dead for two years. The other girl, kerry, also said she saw a man but
she did not recognise him, they both described the same man. I dismissed
these claims completely and actually asked the girls if they had been taking
drugs. However they both said no and demanded to be let home. I gave them
a lift home, and when i returned me and my daughter shared a bed because
we were both rather shaken by the affair. Nothing more happened until about
two weeks later when i was sitting at home reading, suddenly i just got
the feeling i was being watched. This feeling came over me very suddenly
and for no apparent reason. I carried on reading for a further twenty minutes
however the feeling did not pass, i put my book down and just happened
to glance up at the cupboard above the tv. What I saw terrified me then
and still does to this moment, i saw a mans upper torso and head (no legs)
bobbing or floating in mid air. Although the man had no legs his head was
in the correct *place*, as in the same place it would have been had he
had legs. The expression on the mans face was what scarred me the most.
He seemed to be staring right in my eyes and he had an evil smile on his
face. I felt as though this evil man was going to harm me, however, after
about five seconds of me staring at this man he just disappeared. After
this it became regular for sounds to be heard around the house and things
to be moved, etc., which was not only annoying but terrified the hell out
of me and my daughter. I moved my daughters bed into my room so that this
man could not harm her when she was sleeping (and also because I did not
want to be alone!!!). My daughter was often woken in the night for no reason
and (she did not tell me this for some time) she felt like she was being
pinned down to the bed, she would also not be able to make any sound, e.g.
scream for help. The house then started to affect our emotions, we would
come into the house feeling happy and then after about half an hour we
would feel drained and have to sleep. This affected my daughter more than
me and she started sleeping allot more than usual. She would come in from
school feeling ok then she would soon start feeling tired and she would
sleep from about 4 o'clock till 7, the weird thing was she would also sleep
at night. This was weird because she was normally a very active girl and
she suddenly changed from this to a lazy and drained girl who always looked
ill. She would tell me she felt groggy. Anyway, I would often feel this
mans presence however, I would not see him. I think this scared me more
because I could just imagine his evil eyes watching me and that smile......
Anyway, after about 2 months since I first saw this 'man' i began hearing
his voice. At first it was very quiet and i couldn't really make it out.
Then when it got louder it appeared to be a song, a sailor song perhaps.
I couldn't always make out the words however, I did once hear 'and when
the wind blows we'll all stick together.' The scary thing was that it would
happen right next to my ear, as if he was right next to my ear whispering
this song to me. This was the last straw for me, and I went to seek help
from a priest, although I am not christian and don't believe in God it
seemed like the only option and I just needed to get this evil presence
from my house. The Priest came and did a *service* type thing and blessed
the house. Since then I have not had any problems from the *man*, I have
not heard, seen or sensed anything and much to my delight my daughter has
stopped sleeping all the time and the house seems to be back to normal.
I pray every night now and thank God for helping me and I ask him to continue
to keep an eye out for me and my daughter.</b>
<br><b>I am very thankful that I have found a professional web-site and
would like to hear what you think about my experience. I personally feel
that one of the girls that stayed that night left a kind of evil or presence
in my house. What do you think? Thank you for your time</b><b></b>

<p><b>Let me start about three years ago, when I moved into my now husbands
home. I never mentioned to him the things that I was seeing. I would occasionally
see shadows move in front of the door of my sons room. This would happen
in daylight and at night. There would be no one in the house but my two
sleeping children and myself. I would also occasionally hear the sounds
of a dog or cat collar in the room. I didn?t pay much attention to this
until I saw the white shadow of a cat dart across the living room floor.
I became a little inquisitive after seeing these things happen and put
some things on the mantle of the fireplace. I spoke aloud and said if there
was anything there to move the object that I had placed there. I never
saw anything, and just marked it off to being my imagination. Later I went
to find the object and it was gone, I don?t mean moved, but gone! I have
also noticed I cant keep cream colored almost yellowish candles. Everytime
I buy and place them out, they dis!</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;appear, never to be found again. I have bought red, green,
orange, any other color candles and put them out, and nothing happens.
The cream candles also have a tendency to go out on their own. This always
happens with the windows shut and no fans of any kind running in the house.
I have also heard voices over the baby monitor. I would place the receiving
end in the part of the house where the children were, so I could hear the</b>
<br><b>wake at night. On several occasions I would hear chatter, go to
check it out and the kids would be asleep, no radios on, windows down,
and tv off.&nbsp; Again I had ignored the fact that anything could possibly
be going on in my house, and eventually forgot about the happenings, and
let them go.</b>
<br><b>About a year later, a friend asked to move in with us from out of
state until he could find a place of his own. Of course we said yes being
as eager as we were to help out a friend. He and his children came to stay
with us, which brings me up to date. I have not seen or heard anything
in the house until his teenage daughter comes to me and says she is afraid
to sleep in my daughters room because she hears voices at night and the
water bed moved like someone was touching it, but the dog was no where
to be found. It couldn?t possibly be her jumping up on the bed to sleep
with her. She also told me that one particular night the computer room
moved to an almost closed state, but never shut completely and swung back
open. It was at this time I revealed to her some of the things that had
happened to my husband and myself. We told a chat friend about this and
she gave us the shadowlands.com site, and we ventured on there about a
week after these things occurred. We looked around th!</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;e site and pictures, and learned what orbs were. It wasn?t
until then we got the idea to look over some pictures we had taken only
a few days earlier with my friends digital camera. Low and behold we have
counted as many as seven orbs in one picture. Call me crazy, call me stupid,
but we now believe. We believe to the point we are going to do some purposely
posed pictures with 35mm and digital camera, turn on the monitor, and do
several different types of audio recording. I hope to capture some kind
of proof that Tiffany, my husband and I are not crazy. My husband and I
started thinking about the history of the land, because we have been the
only owners of this house. However, the land we live on is only a couple
miles where the original gold rush</b>
<br><b>egan years before it hit the west coast. And still today if you
do it correctly and look long enough you may find some gold in the mines
of Gold Mine Road.</b>

<br><b>Our Lost Little Girl</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:wigls1@new.rr.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>we have an extra child in the house. She has long dark curly hair,
an ankle length yellow paisley dress and button up shoes. She turned up
the tv really loud on my teenage daughter and when my daughter turned it
down the attic door slammed open and shut like she was mad at her for turning
it down.She has appeared several times to my children when they are up
in their rooms. and once to my husband who spent the night up there while
the kids were gone just to see if it wasn't just the kids imagination.She
doesn't seem to mean anybody any harm. she's just there. When everyone
is out of the house except me, I hear footsteps coming halfway down our
wooden stairs and stop. when i look no one is there.We've come to the conclusion
that she is trapped upstairs or was made to stay upstairs in life.but recently
i caught her down in the livingroom a couple times which leads me to believe
she's becoming more trusting of us. Recently my teen daughter came running
down in the middle of the night saying she could here the girl crying.
she was more upset that the ghost is so sad then anything. so we sat together
and prayed that God show her the way home to heaven and free her from he
ties here. we talked to the girl telling her to go towards the light. she
doesn't have to be trapped here. that there are her people waiting for
her in the light.Since we did that we haven't heard or seen anything.it's
been about a month now. do you think even though we have no paranormal
abilities our simple prayers and talking to her helped. I'm thinking she
is gone. but I'm not sure.She just seems so lost. I hope that she has moved
on.</b>

<p><b>Curious Ghost</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: jdcantel@MtHolyoke.edu</b><b></b>
<p><b>About 6 months ago my partner and I were spending the night at a
family</b>
<br><b>friend's house.&nbsp; It was about 11pm and we both saw a human
figure standing</b>
<br><b>by the bedroom window looking out.&nbsp; We had both seen ghosts
in the past,</b>
<br><b>and it wasn't being disruptive, so we both just went to sleep.</b>
<br><b>This weekend I was back at the same friend's house and had been
asleep for</b>
<br><b>a few hours when I woke up to see a man kneeling beside my bed,
looking at</b>
<br><b>me.&nbsp; As I was not expecting it, and the figure looked very
real, I</b>
<br><b>screamed.&nbsp; The man appeared startled and disappeared.&nbsp;
My partner also</b>
<br><b>felt the presence of the ghost, but didn't open her eyes because
she</b>
<br><b>didn't want to see it.</b>
<br><b>At first I chalked it up to being a dream and that I was overreacting,
but</b>
<br><b>I realized that had I been dreaming I wouldn't have been able to
scream,</b>
<br><b>as I have never been able to scream during a dream.&nbsp; This was
very real.</b>
<br><b>I don't think the ghost was evil, I just think he was curious as
to who I</b>
<br><b>was.</b>
<br><b>The owner of the house has heard noises coming from that room, but
hasn't</b>
<br><b>spent the night there, so has never seen anything.</b>

<p><b>Mobile Home</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: medinagm2002@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hi, I live in Texas.&nbsp; I lived in a haunted house.&nbsp; It was
a mobile home.&nbsp; The mobile home was built for us.&nbsp; But the land
where we put the home on was suppose to be on a ranch that was owned by
a family for over one hundred years. (I never checked this out, so this
is just a rumor.)&nbsp; But we had incidents of lights coming on when we
turned them off.&nbsp; Radios playing when they were off.&nbsp; My daughter&nbsp;
was 10 years old at the time and dealing with some issues.&nbsp; She would
smart off to me and she would be pinched or hit right after the incident.&nbsp;
I would hear footsteps in the home and would assume it was the house settling.&nbsp;
One night I was up late and I saw a man's shadow on the wall.&nbsp; I also
assumed I had imagined it.&nbsp; I really did not accept any haunting until
one night my girlfriend, my daughter and her friend, and my husband were
sitting at a table talking.&nbsp; My microwave door was opened and this
microwave oven was old and the door was heavy.&nbsp; As we were talking
the door just started closing on its own.&nbsp; This happened twice.&nbsp;
One Saturday morning,&nbsp; I was cleaning my room, my daughter had left
the house to go to a friend's house. I heard the breakfast dishes being
moved. &amp; sp;I thought it was my daughter doing the dishes but I never
checked.&nbsp; I could hear her moving chairs and opening and closing the
pantry door.&nbsp; After a few moments,&nbsp; I heard the front door open
and I heard my daughter yell she was home.&nbsp; It was then I realized
that she was not the one moving the dishes, she had not been in the house.&nbsp;
I walked to the kitchen and all the dishes in the sink had been moved to
the cabinet by the sink.&nbsp; The glasses that had been on the table also
had been moved.&nbsp; All the paper towels that had been on the table were
now in the trash can and all the chairs had been pushed under the table.&nbsp;
I also was in my room when I felt someone put their hand&nbsp; on my shoulder,
I assumed it was my daughter, but when I turned around there was no one
there.&nbsp; I was never really scared until those two incidents happened.&nbsp;
My husband and I&nbsp; eventually moved from that house to move to the
city.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Everywhere I Go</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: DanielMorr6@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>it seems that after my stay in Japan in 1989-1990 I've several encounters
with the unknown. i was 13 years olds and very curious about the super
natural. some friends and i would play around with the Ouija board just
for fun until one a couple of friends decided to make their own. it was
in thick about 21 inches wide and 2 ft long. the letters were burned into
the board. the symbols were their own designs. we played with it not knowing
the actual power that it really had. after playing with it for awhile things
started to happen. we just started seeing things acting different, funny.
we couldn't explain why. one night we were playing with it and my friends
were asking it questions and it seem that whatever was answering the questions
was getting mad. i wasn't even touching the board when it yanked me across
the board. it also said that it wasn't going to allow me to leave Japan,
but i thought it was lying because i was leaving in a week. the day before
i was to leave i asked my dad what time was my flight home and he told
me that i wasn't leaving because something was wrong with my paperwork.
so when i finally did leave things were quiet for a while. about a year
later something happened that had me really spooked. i was telling one
of my best friends a little of what happened in Japan and she interrupted
me and told me that the night before while there was a storm, there was
a calm during the storm there outside was a voice that was asking for me.
she told me that she didn't want to tell me because she didn't want to
scare me. things got a little funny for a while. i thought that if i get
away that maybe things would change. well they did for a while, shortly
after my 21 St. birthday things got strange. one evening i walked into
my livingroom and the glass plate of the last supper i had sitting on the
table across the room shattered into pieces. no one was in the room but
me. then at night i would hear footsteps in the house. one night i got
up to get a drink from the bathroom and on my way back i passed the kitchen.
there was something in there and was watching me.&nbsp; everywhere i went
in the house i was being followed. so i moved from the house. again things
stopped. about a year after i moved into the new house things started back
up. i could be in the house by myself and i would hear upstairs footsteps,
doors opening and closing, and toys being moved across the floor. that
went on for a while and i was getting use to it, but one night i had my
little brother over for a couple of weeks before he moved out of the state.
i took a shower about 12am, the house was completely dark so i had to find
my way. as i was going down the hall i seen a dark figure standing at the
top of the stairs, thinking it was my brother coming up i stopped. i told
him that it was late and he needed to go to bed, but he didn't move. so
i told him that i was going to bed and walked to my room. when i got there
i found my brother asleep in the bed. so ever since then i knew something
was in the house. for about five years i just dealt with. i would get up
at night to turn around and run back to my room because of the uneasy feeling
i would get that i was being watched. i would drive at night and get images
of dead people walking down the highway. so i moved again but this time
it didn't stop. i was in the kitchen one evening cooking dinner for my
family and i turned around to catch a glimpse of someone standing behind
me then disappear. now i am 28 years old and i can say that I've just about
seen it all. strange things still happen to this day that i can't explain.
i haven't told u everything but I'm pretty sure you know the rest.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Babysitting</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: spongemonkey004@btinternet.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I'm Alex, I'm 16 and I live in Wales, in the UK. About a month ago
some friends of our family asked me to baby-sit for their two young kids
(Sioned is five and Iola is just about one.). I got there and the mother
of the two kids showed me the baby monitor, told me when to put the kids
to sleep and then left quickly, as they were already late. I wanted to
make sure I did a good job of this, so I asked Sioned to go upstairs and
yell into the other end of the baby monitor, just to be sure it was working.
Sure enough, lots of yelling and we had some fun passing messages back
and forth through the monitor. Sioned came back downstairs and we watched
some videos. Iola fell asleep, and so I carried her upstairs to her cot
in Sioned's room, right by the baby monitor. Sioned followed me upstairs
and quietly got into bed. I took myself downstairs, after bidding the kids
a good night's sleep. I sat in their lounge room and watched some war movies
and nearly fell asleep a few times. At one point I was jerked out of sleep
from hearing Sioned get up to use the bathroom, and could hear her every
step of the way by the baby monitor (I had turned the volume up to be super-sure
of myself). Anyway, after a while there was some creeping upstairs. It
was only about eight or maybe nine o'clock, so I thought it was probably
one of the kids coming down to complain about a nightmare or something.
As I went up the stairs, I could hear that the movement was on the landing.
However, from the stairs I could see all of the landing, and there was
nothing there. I thought about the baby monitor, and how it could hear
things all over. I found it in my jeans pocket and listened to it very
carefully, but I couldn't hear anything. This was more confusing than scary,
so I went to see how the kids were, seeing as I was already a half way
up the stairs. As soon as I stepped foot on the landing, the creaking stopped,
and all I could hear were my own footsteps. I stuck my head into the kids
room, and checked on them, then went downstairs. I listened for the creaking
again, and sure enough it came again, loud and clear. It went on for the
rest of the night, up to and past when the parents came home at about one
o'clock, when we sat down for a drink. I asked them about the creaking,
and they weren't phased by it at all, as they were very much used to it.
They showed me how the footsteps never go into their room, which was an
extension added only in the last few years, and how they must be quite
long footsteps, and quite confident, going by the regularity and the distance
between them. We also listened for where they stopped, which they did once
in a while. We listened very carefully, and we figured that they stopped
in the bathroom a lot, which was odd (Maybe we have a ghost with bowel
problems?). When we went to stand under the bathroom to listen to it, we
realised that rather than being on the floor above, the creaking was definitely
originating from somewhere about a half a foot down from the ceiling, which
would mean they were in mid-air. Anyway, what inspired me to write to you
was this: Our friends were looking through the history of the house, and
found that in the late 1800's, the house had undergone a significant overhaul
and all the floors on the upper level had been raised about 8 inches. They
used to think that this ghost was one belonging to the previous owner,
who died at quite an early age. His early death was attributed to how much
coffee he drank (Which would also explain the regular toilet stops) and
the high amount of sugar in his coffee (Which would explain all the anxious
walking around aswell!). Whatever it is, its definitely a pacifist ghost,
as it has never bothered to interfere any more than walking around mostly
on the landing and in the kids room. Thanks for reading!</b>

<p><b>Dead Mother Visits with Friends Dead Mother</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: gnjolicoeur@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>This happened during the month of Nov.2004... I got a phone call
from my best friend, who informed me of her mothers death. I went to sleep
that night feeling down and remembering when my mother died two years prior
to this. My life was in turmoil at the time and my toxic family made everything
worse. For starters I have excommunicated them from myself and feel much
better ...As I slept I entered a 3d dimmension where I saw my friends mother
with short hairstyle and looking much older, but still her bright eyes
were happy. Only where her feet should have been there was mist. She swiftly
glided away to return with my mother whose eyes were bright and happy!
Not at all like when I had seen her at the hospital suffering. My friends
mom had her arm around the back of my mom, she said go ahead tell her....
My mom suddenly made a flash with her eyes then I could hear her voice
say I AM PROUD OF YOU! Then they both turned to mist and I was awake. I
did not remember the entire dream only that I had dreamt of my mom.</b>
<br><b>I readied myself for the funeral parlor and when I saw my friends
mom in the casket. She was exactly like I had seen her in the encounter.
I had not seen her in many years and the hairstyle and aging of the face
were identical. I blurted out she looks great just like the dream.... my
friend said Oh My God What? She knows about my weird abilities through
dreams. We left the room to go speak in the hall. As I was relating to
her about seeing her mother happy and looking like she did I was able only
at that moment to remember what her mother brought my mother to tell me.
I blurted that out and we both cried in each others arms.</b><b></b>

getting dark so we had to go home. While we were walking we saw a big wight

<br><b>I could have swore it was a van but Emily didn't say anything on
our way home.</b>
<br><b>Now there are more houses and Emily and I wanted to go inside one.(it

After about 10 minutes she came running up the stairs. All she said was
can we go?</b>
<br><b>We started walking home when she finally told me what she saw.</b>
<br><b>She said that she heard a little girl cough then she turned around

<br><b>A Musical Experience</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Katherine-Rosario@IDEXX.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have an experience I would like to share, it happened last night
in the</b>
<br><b>basement of our new house. I have been living in this house with
my husband</b>
<br><b>and two room mates for about two months now. I have felt absolutely
nothing</b>
<br><b>in the house (our last house had a presences ). The reason we loved
the</b>
<br><b>house was there was two floor plus a finish basement with a bar
that was</b>
<br><b>built in the 70s, all original 70s decor. At our opening party one
of the</b>
<br><b>guest said there was a evil presence in the basement, and a nice
presence in</b>
<br><b>the upstairs bathroom. I disagreed with her saying that there was
nothing in</b>
<br><b>the house, then two weeks ago another friend said they could feel
something</b>
<br><b>in our basement. Again I got anger, and disagreed.</b>
<br><b>Our basement is divided with the bar area on one side and a very
basement</b>
<br><b>area on the other with washer and dryer, heater ect. That is also
were my</b>
<br><b>stain glass studio is with the work bench. You get between the two
area</b>
<br><b>through a door. When working on my bench I face the concrete wall
with my</b>
<br><b>back to the heater and to my left is the door to the other room
which when</b>
<br><b>standing at my bench I can see the door out of the corner of my
eye. Under</b>
<br><b>the stairs is a closet with a door that we have push a table against
(for</b>
<br><b>space reason), so we do not use that closet. I have a black cat
name Sammy</b>
<br><b>who enjoys coming down to hunt for mice when I work. Last night
I was in the</b>
<br><b>basement working on my glass with the radio on a hip hop station
( the radio</b>
<br><b>is located on top of the bar in the other room ). I caught a glimpse
of a</b>
<br><b>black shadow moving across the door way in the bar room coming from
the</b>
<br><b>closet going into the bar area.&nbsp;&nbsp; I turn around and looked
for Sammy cat,</b>
<br><b>thinking he decided to join me, but he was not there. So I blew
it off as a</b>
<br><b>over active imagation and started working again. About two minutes
later my</b>
<br><b>radio in the other room changed station and turn it self up. It
changed to</b>
<br><b>an oldies station on which Mister Sandman was playing. I flew so
fast out of</b>
<br><b>that room, through the bar area and up the stairs it was funny,
screaming</b>
<br><b>for my room mates. My male room mate came around the corner and
I had him</b>
<br><b>come downstairs, while we where still upstairs the station changed
back to</b>
<br><b>the hip hop station. My room mate who was in the living room had
heard the</b>
<br><b>radio change stations also. We went downstairs to investgate together,
but</b>
<br><b>everything was just how I left it.</b>
<br><b>I gather my stain glass work and continue to work on it upstairs,
I will try</b>
<br><b>to go back down there tonight. I do not mine if there is something
down</b>
<br><b>there, and "I will listen to the oldies, just don't touch me or
mess with my</b>
<br><b>glass." I stated this on my way up the stairs last night to the
bar area and</b>
<br><b>I hope it was listening.</b><b></b>

<p><b>A Haunting from My Childhood</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: rj014l2767@blueyonder.co.uk</b><b></b>
<p><b>I am a 27 year old female from England. When i was 7 years old my
parents, myself and my brother moved into a new house. The lady who lived
there before told my parents that one of her relatives committed suicide
in the house. Obviously it didnt bother my parents as the were very sceptical.
And me and my brother were obviously too young to be told this. After a
few months went by, weird things were happening to me. I would start to
stay up in my room, even when i didnt feel like it, something just kept
me going in there. The house was always very cold, even with the central
heating on. You could always see vapour coming out of our mouths as we
were breathing, like on a cold day outside. I had lots of toys in my room.
I used to put them in one particular place, and come back into my room
to find them in another. I dont remember but my parents tell me that at
one time i came downstairs crying because i had seen my toy ponies fly
across the room, they didnt believe me. Then my brother woke one morning
to find pictures of cars drawn on the window in the condensation. It couldnt
have been him because they were too good. I also used to have a life size
doll that i used to put in a pram at night. The next morning, occasionally,
it would be stood lent against the wall. I kept on at my parents, telling
them all the strange things that were happening but they just didnt believe
me. We used to have a german shepherd dog, he used to sit at the bottom
of the stairs and he used to look up them and whine all the time. Then
one night, my mother believed me, my dad was working on the night shift,
and she was in bed alone, when the bed lifted up on its own while she was
in it and it shook. She ran out of the house and left me and my brother
asleep, she&nbsp; went to the neighbours house and phoned my dad from work.
She didnt tell us this at the time. My dad was still sceptical, but was
closer to any belief that something was going on. Then one night when both
my parents were in bed, a loud noise at my dads side of the bed was banging
against the floor, as he described, it was like someone hitting a shoe
on the floor. Then they really started to believe. After that, the presence
made itself known. Our toothbrushes in the bathroom would rattle all night.
All day we heard noises, as if someone was walking around upstairs, the
dog didnt move from the bottom of the stairs, as if he was guarding us.
My parents decided to go to the local church to see if anything could be
done. They sent us off to their friends house. The vicar and some of his
members went to our house and put their hands on my parents heads, and
a photo of me and my brother in every room of the house and blessed every
room.&nbsp; After that, we were amazed, we had never felt the house to
be so warm, there was no more vapour when we breathed, the house was so
quiet and the dog disappeared from the bottom of the stairs. After it all
ended. A few years later my mother told us that the man who committed suicide
in the house, actually did it in my room and the lady that used to live
there was my age when he did it. We think maybe, he thought i was her.</b><b></b>

<p><b>The White Ghost Camp Man</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: krvavacd@hotmail.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>In 1998 our school went on a camp trip to Arbury Park Outdoor School
(it's located in Australia, Adelaide). On the second night there while
everyone was still in the 'kitchen' my best friend, Kathryn, and I decided
to go to our dormitory (by the way it was 9:30, late at night )... which
was the furtherest from all 6... Anyway we were walking very slowly because
we were tired from the "activities" we done, and suddenly we heard something,
we turned around but no one was there... we kept on walking then it came
again a weird sound.. Kathryn turned and froze, so did I because there
was the most weirdest thing ever... there standing near us was a white
man fully dressed in white with a white hat.. then as fast as possible
we saw it disappear like a little "zip" then we RAN to our dorm' really
fast... We told all of our friends what we saw, most of them laughed but
some looked worried... the weirdest thing of all was that it was white..
because we couldn't even see each other it was white and so clear... the
memory of it is still in my brain and i believe....</b>
<br><b>.... the most thing that made me believe even more is that I read
a story like mine on this site but it was said to be infront of a house
with 3 acres of wood and the "white man" ran down to the creek.... There
was a house with a creek near it just next to the campsite... when i told
my friend this she was so shocked...... Do you believe??</b><b></b>

<p><b>Odd Things</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: mybrosmellslikecheese@msn.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>last year a number of strange things started descending over my household
and my father was very unwilling to accept it, i have allways noticed odd
things but they had never been strong enough for anyone else to pick up
on.</b>
<br><b>me and my family live in a brand new house on a very old landscape
next to an old boarding school where there have been many hauntings that
i have recently found out about but this house that im about to talk about
doesnt have any history that i know of with anyone dying here.</b>
<br><b>so i will start from the begining, there have allways been lights
flikering and candles swaying, and strange smells that originated from
no where in my home but i was fine with it and still am to this day.</b>
<br><b>but when other people strated to know was when my best friend was
staying over and we had both gone to sleep and she woke up at about 5-6
AM and she was about to wake me up and ask me what my baby sister was doing
in there............but with a closer glance she noticed it wasnt my 2
year old sister but someone who looked a lot like her and she was looking
straight at us, she was very shaken up because a few seconds after she
just disapeard.</b>
<br><b>the next day i was interested in finding out more about are residential
guest which i was very pleased to know that my mum now belived me about
alot of the things happening.</b>
<br><b>she then reminded me about her miscariage that was about 6 years
ago that week and the baby would have been a girl..........about the same

on and off, my brother and his friend were in my room playing a playstation
game and the tv just went off scaring them.......this happend 2 more times
to them that day.</b>
<br><b>the smells that i have smelt were very pretty and we have connected
this smell to either my mothers best friend who tragicly died almost 4
years ago...............my mum knows it was her because of her distinct
perfume, we have also felt her pressance on numorous times.</b>
<br><b>in the summer holidays last year we went away for 2 weeks and left
a key for the cleaner, she was listening to some music and as it faded
out she heard the voice of a little girl humming the tune........the tv
in the living room then turned on downstairs, there was no-one else in
the house apart from her she speedily finishd the job and got out as fast
as possible.</b>
<br><b>she hates being alone in the house now.</b>
<br><b>this year things have calmd down but there is still smells and things

pressence of things here and sometimes it can be scary but i know im not
in any harm form them and they are watching over us.</b>
<br><b>at first when i started noticing these paranormal happenings i was
very sceard and thought about polterguists.</b>
<br><b>but if i could ever get my next door neighbor that lives in the
school house to write a story about what happens there..................i
know you would all be very interested because there is so many spirits
there and i know because there have been a number of times i have been
there with her cousion who s very sensative to these things............but
another coninsedence is that the smells from what we belive to be my mothers
best friend, she used to live in that house until her and her husbund moved
and just before they wer going to move into their new house she died of
a blood clot in south africa.</b>
<br><b>thanks for reading my story i hope you enjoyed it......and if you
can help it never be scared of what you dont know becasue most of the time
there is nothing to be scared of!!</b>

<p><b>Never Believed Until Now</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Sheiladumplin@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>When I was living in Georgia with my ex we rented this trailer, at
the time I did'nt know about the history of it.&nbsp; One night me and
my ex were laying in bed the lights out ready to go to sleep.&nbsp; I had
my head on his chest and could hear his heart beating, a few minutes later
the door slowly started to open.&nbsp; I thought at first it was my daughter
but it was'nt, I seen this shadow of a man and it started coming toward
the bed. I tried to move off of my exes chest but he pulled me back down
toward him and when he did his heart was pounding harder than mine.&nbsp;
I reached back to flip the light switch on our headboard and it dissapeared.&nbsp;
I asked him what he saw and he wanted to know what I saw, then we both
started discribing the same thing.&nbsp; The man was an older gentleman
with a flannel type shirt and overalls on. I could'nt believe what we had
just seen. We found out later that the man had died on the property in
another home that had been torn down and they made a small trailer park
out of it. This man was around 80 years old when he died and the house
was torn down about 20 years after that. Well I can say now that I truly
believe in ghost after that night and no one can convince me otherwise.</b>

<br><b>My Scary Ghost Story</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: whacl2@ccomm.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>This is my ghost story it all began when my best friend moved in
to this creepy lookin apartment buliding. Every weekend I and 1 other friend
would sleep over her new house. It was one of those nights when theres
nothing to do mostly because it was about 2:00 in the morning. So we thought
it was best if we hit the hay. As a tradition we always would make tents
out of blankets. So we walked in to the living room to get the blankets,
just as I was about to wak back to the bedroom I turned bcause I thought
I had seen another blanket just as Idid I saw this white thing floating
in front of the door. I stared at it for a few seconds then it took the
form of a young women. She had no legs, she was wearing an old fashioned
dress withan apro you might say she looked like a pirie girl. She also
had a big bow in her hair. My friends that had slep over before told me
they had seen something matching the discription. All I could do was stare.I
really didn't think anything of the other things that had happened before,
like doors slaming shut a huge mirror falling from the walls, my friend's
dolls would end up in different spots than she put them in. Slowly as I
watched she just disappeared as fast as she had appeared. I was left there
staring at an empty door way so I just ran back to the room and couldn't
speak a word. The next day I was outside waiting for my friends to come
out the landlord came by. So Iasked him"had there been any&nbsp; deaths
in the apartment he said before it was bulit there was said to be an old
house there he said there had been a romor that a young women was murdered
there." So I said thankyou snd went home. About a year later my friend
moved away and her apartment was left empty to this day some people would
move in then right back out again so it's still empty even today.</b><b></b>

<br><b>then their aunt put her hand out over kellys mums head and said
"kelly wantd you to feel how she died" it simply felt like a tingling sensation
over her head and her eyes closed.</b>
<br><b>one thing that strikes me as odd about this tale is that kelly died
with her eyes open......i think that when her eyes closed that was her
leaving her body.</b>

<p><b>Child Ghost</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Sweetcandz@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I live in a block of maisonettes and some of us residents have encountered
spooky goings on!</b>
<br><b>I moved in here 5 years ago. The bedroom my daughter slept in seemed
to generate bad vibes at night but happy (though strange) during the day.</b>
<br><b>If my daughter was playing in her room, she would often tell me
there was someone sitting on her bed with her. She said it was a little
girl but she didnt know her name.&nbsp; In the night, my daughter would
awake screaming that a man was trying to get her.&nbsp; As she was only
3 years old, I thought she was just having nightmares, until a neighbour
told me a very similar story about her child.</b>
<br><b>This worried me a bit but I just dismissed it, but then I started
hearing things, footsteps, someone running up and down the stairs when
everyone was asleep.&nbsp; A few times I heard someone calling 'mummy'
but never saw anyone there and could rule out it being either of my children.</b>
<br><b>I bought a talisman to protect the room and had it 'cleansed' and
have since never had a problem in the room though I still hear the footsteps
occasinally and only one 'mummy'.</b>
<br><b>Meanwhile, my neighbour has recently started experiencing things
again so she called on the help of a Medium.&nbsp; She didnt tell him whats
been going on so as not to influence him in any way.&nbsp; He told her
there was a little girl who liked to come and play with the children. She
wasnt grounded to her property and he felt she visited the whole building
rather than just my neighbour's house.&nbsp; Though the child was kind
and nothing to be scared of, there was someone who scared her terribly
and he felt it would occur at night. He also picked up a presence of a
young boy who was quite harmless but very mischevious.&nbsp; He felt the
boy was grounded to that particular house and the girl liked to visit him.&nbsp;
My neighbour then explained to him that a few people that had stayed in
a particular room in her house had said they felt as though they'd been
kicked or pushed.</b>
<br><b>Anyway, after hearing what he had to say, I think that the girl
and the man my daughter was seeing are the same ones that the Medium had
picked up on in my neighbours house.&nbsp; My daughter was terrified him
so maybe she was 'reliving' almost what the girl had experienced.</b>
<br><b>Other neighbours have said they thought they heard someone calling
though they were home alone and often thought they could hear footsteps
on the stairs etc.</b>
<br><b>I just hope the girl (and the boy) are at peace and that the man
never comes back.</b>

<p><b>The Young Girl in the Apartment</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Claudia.Carreon@opco.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I am origanilly form Argentina, I came to the US, with my parents
and my two sisters, when I was 8 years old and moved to Arlington, VA.
The apartment comlice is called Buckingham village. I was a two level apartment,
we live down stairs and upstairs lived a couple, I really don't remember
them, I do remember they had a black dog. A couple of months or so after
moving there the woman of the house dies, where she died was right above
my parents bedroom. I really don't recall but that was what my mother told
me. Anyway years went by and the 1st time I sensed something was weird
was when I was home alone and there was a rain storm, I had locked the
doors like my parents had asked me to. I was watching t.v. when I heard
the the lock come undone and the door opened all by itself. I never told
my parents about it, because at that time I was not sure what it was all
about. As years went by I was in high school, while I was sleeping I awoke
with a woman with long stringy hair looking down at me I tried to scream
but couldn't, funny thing was I thought it was my youngest sister trying
to scare me, when she finally disappeared I screamed and my sister, who's
bed was near mine woke up and asked me what was wrong. Well she didn't
believe me at all. Then couple of months later I am in the kitchen, in
the back of the apartments there was this tree. While I was preparing lunch
for my sister I saw a woman, like the one that woke me, standing there,
funny thing I would only see her from the corner of my eye, but once I
looked her direction she would disappear. At first I thought it was the
kids around the neighborhood playing. I freaked closed the window and just
forgot about it. Then it all stopped. Years passed and I had my daughter
and I was living with my parents. When she was a baby we slept in the room
where I had first seen the lady..which for some wierd reason I named her
LISA, well my daughter was hungry and I was reading a magazine, so I put
the magazine down and went to the kitchen with my daughter when I come
back the magazine was gone, and all of sudden I just started talking out
loud and said "Lisa I am going to leave now and when I come back I want
my magazine back!"..so I left the room came back five minutes later and
there was my magazine right where I left it and at the page I was reading!!!
Funny thing about all of this was that a girl friend of mine didn't believe
me, until she came over one night, all the lights were off we were watching
t.v. and LISA decides to show her self and walks right pass the t.v.!!
I look at my friend and she was pale white, and she looked at me and said.."Did
you see that?", and I said yeah, and she was quiet, she never stepped foot
in that apartment ever again. A couple of years later I tell my mom about
this woman I was seeing and at times sensed her being around me, and my
mom was like oh so you too have seen her. I couldn't believe my ears!!
She had been seeing her all along, she told me that could see what she
looked like, where as I only saw her shadowed figure. We moved out in 1996,
not because of her, but that the it started getting worse with gang activity.
Funny thing about all of this is I feel that Lisa came with my parents,
because at the new house, I know I saw her at the top of the stairs, my
mother looked and me and asked me what was wrong, I told my mom I think
she is here, and my mother's response was, I know me too.</b>
<br><b>I also have another story and this happened at my husband fathers
house..that I will tell later, it this one is much worse, this person was
not as nice as lisa was.</b><b></b>

<p><b>The Figure!</b>

<p><b>By: Sparklingdevil69@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>When I was 14, I had just finished reading ghost stries when i closed
down the internet and went to bed. I awoke with a stranger eerie feeling
over me it was like someone was staring at me. I opened up my eyes and
saw nothing. I closed my eyes and went back to sleep. At about 2:30 I awoke
again with this same stranger eerie feeling. This time when I opened my
eyes I saw a outline of a human body standing in the doorway. I freaked
out and ran to the kitchen thats when I felt a hand upon my shoulder.I
turned around and saw that strange outline standing behind me. Then, what
felt like 20 seconds later the outline vanished. To this day I see the
figure walking and pacing or even standing at the foot of my bed or in
the door way</b><b></b>

<p><b>My Son's imaginary friend</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: ADITTFIE@amfam.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>My son at the age of 2 1/2 started to play with his "imaginary friend".&nbsp;
I was confused the first time I had ever heard him talking to himself in
his bedroom. I went in to see what he was doing and he was laughing.&nbsp;
He was as naturally talking to the air as if he were talking and carrying
on with me.&nbsp; I asked him who he was talking to and he responded "it's
Beeko mommy".&nbsp; I said "Beeko, who is Beeko?"&nbsp; He said "don't
you see him mommy?&nbsp; He is right here"&nbsp; I was amused by the whole
situation and just laughed.&nbsp; I thought that I would humor my son and
asked "well, what kind of name is Beeko for a little boy anyway?"&nbsp;
He replied "Beeko is not a little boy, he is a man."&nbsp; I swear at that
time I felt cold air run all over my body.&nbsp; At that exact moment the
chill went away when my son said, "Mommy, Beeko will come back to play
with me when you are gone."&nbsp; I was a little freaked out but I said
"ok, well let's go watch a movie buddy."&nbsp; On several occasions my
son would be alone in his room just giggling, laughing, playing his heart
out.&nbsp; The moment I would walk in the room, I would go COLD!&nbsp;
My son always responded that Beeko would come back when I was gone.&nbsp;
My son is now 6 and we no longer live in the same house.&nbsp; He does
not talk about Beeko anymore at all.&nbsp; When he was 5 he started to
get irritated with Beeko.&nbsp; I would hear him in his room now arguing
with Beeko and telling him he did not want to play with him.&nbsp; I would
go in there and Beeko would leave. My son started to complain that his
room was always cold.&nbsp; He would wake up in the middle of the night
sobbing almost every night.&nbsp; One night, my son was asleep in bed.&nbsp;
He started yelling for me so I ran in his room.&nbsp; He said "mommy, tell
Beeko to stop talking!"&nbsp; I said "Mommy does not hear Beeko talking"&nbsp;
He started to cry " Mommy you don't hear that man talking and laughing"&nbsp;
I said "No"&nbsp; However, I could feel him.&nbsp; My son started to cry
harder, "please mommy, tell him to stop talking, he is scaring me"&nbsp;
I was petrified for my son as he was scared.&nbsp; I yelled "go away, leave
him alone.&nbsp; He does not want to play with you anymore.&nbsp; In Jesus
name I command thee to leave"&nbsp; At that moment, my son stopped crying
and the room was not cold.&nbsp; I laid with him for awhile and he slept
sound.&nbsp; He never talked about Beeko again!&nbsp; I am not sure what
was going on but something was there.&nbsp; I don't understand why Beeko
was nice at first, but then started to scare my son.&nbsp; I guess we will
never know.&nbsp; I am just glad we do not deal with him anymore.&nbsp;
If your children ever talk about an imaginary friend, ask a lot of questions!!!!</b><b></b>

<p><b>I Believe!</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Anonymous</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>i have believed in ghosts and spirits ever since i was 5 years old.
My first experience came around my 6th birthday shortly after my grandfather
had died. I had a dream where I was holiding my grandmothers hand looking
up at the silouhette of a man standing on a hill with a beautiful classic
sunset from my cottage (where he and my grandmother had lived). I could
not see this mans face but I knew it was my grandfather and it was his
way of saying good bye to me. Later on I have felt his and other presences
sittin on my dresser in my room as i sleep (I cant see anyone but it is
always darker in that corner when i feel someone watching me).</b>
<br><b>My second experience happend about 3 years ago. I've always been
interested in ouija boards and me and my friends were sitting in&nbsp;
my room at my cottage doin ouija talking to one of 2 spirits we normally
talked to. Kate was the one who would tell us that she had a crush on my
boyfriend at the time. when we talked to Kate she would tell us that she
was in the room and in the middle of 30 degree weather you could feel a
cold spot wherever she was, sittin on my boyfriends lap or between me and
him. This led to the most convincing event of my life. A little later that
summer, mid to late august i was staying th my grandmother and had gone
to my cottage to turn on the lights for my parents who were commin up that
night when i heard the distinct sound of the heavy and sticky old drawers
of the dresser in my room. Me being the only one in the cottage and the
noises comming from my room frightened me and i took off, then after about
15 minutes i regained the courage to go back up to the cottage figuring
if i heard noises it was just spirits. As soon as i turned on the first
light i began to hear the antique saws, that we had bolted againsts the
wall, being played with, as if someone was running their fingers along
them and banging them intentionally against the wall. This spooked me but
determined not to let it bother me i turned on my music and sat facing
the door and that wall untill my friends met up with me. A few days later
me and my friends decided to use the ouija board again and we spoke to
both spirits, Kate and Henry. My friends had always asked for a 'sign'
and never recieved one, so we asked if it had been Henry who had done either
act and he had told us that yes he had moved the drawers to give us a sign
and to frighten me. Later on we spoke to Kate who had been playing with
the saws on the wall.</b>
<br><b>The third and most reecent encounter I had was at my grandmother's
(same grandmother i had stayed with and who was married to the grandfather
i mentioned earlier.) funeral. She had been cremated and my father carried
the Urn up to the cemetary. As he placed infront of the grave i saw her
face flash in the Urn for maybe 5 seconds, she was looking out at me and
look healthy unlike the frail sick woman she had been in her last few months.</b>
<br><b>I know for a fact that none of these are facts of my immagination,
they have truly happend and helped to convince me, even as young as 5.</b>

<p><b>Gone Forever Bro</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Spoonscooper@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>Let's start at the begining. My name is Sara Stonecipher and I am
14 years old. I am not really very imaginative. I had a 28 year old brother,
Kenneth. We both lived in the same town. He was married and had his own
house. We still remained in contact alot. But begining in March of 2003,
we started to notice that something wasn't quite&nbsp; right about him.
He started getting unnaturally high temperatures all</b>
<br><b>the time and was sick alot, he had past heart problems when he was
a kid, but it had not given him any trouble since he got older.&nbsp; One
rainy day late in October, me and mom stopped by his house. my mom talked
to him about what was wrong with him. " why don't you change doctors? that
old man is a quack." my mom told him. " forget it mom, im a dead man."
he told her. no ne could convince him to get differrent help.&nbsp; It
was too late the first week of November, right before my birthday, he was
admitted into the hospital. At the end of that week, he passed away due
to blood clots. This happened the day before my birthday and I was shocked
and devastated, when I get sad and upset, I tend to eat. my mom and I went
down to the hospital cafeteria and got something to eat. me and mom were
sitting, eating, and crying. The cook came out all of a sudden with a tray
everyone which there was only us a few other people all looked up at him,
he said&nbsp; " Anyone order a pepperoni pizza slice with extra cheese?"
I thought nothing of it until he said this guy was wearing black and had
a black trenchcoat, he was very quiet." I froze, Kenneth was always kinda
alternative and dressed in black alot and one of his favorite possessions
was a black leather trenchcoat. Kenneth was also very quiet he had a very
whispery-like voice. It was also about eight or nine and there wern't very
many people of that description around in the hospital at that hour. and
no one had seen anyone of that description around there all the time they
were there. I have always wondered whether or not if that was Kenneth trying
to see us one more time before he crossed over. Many other things of the
supernatural has happened to us since his passing. i'll tell ya about those
later.</b>

<br><b>It Happens A Lot</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: evhenry1@twcny.rr.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>In the past, I have had many ghost experiences. The two most recent
&amp; biggest ones are explained below;</b>
<br><b>The first was actually a dream. I'll just skip to the part of the
ghost though, so as not to make the paragraph too long. I saw this one
girl she looked about 8 or 1o &amp; she was very, very torn up &amp; bloody
&amp; I saw some of her insides, the girl was staring at me &amp; when
I ran out of the room I closed my eyes &amp; put my hands out so I could
keep my balance. I felt sticky blood on my hands &amp; face. Then after
i left the building, the scene flashed back to the girl. It showed her
at the place I was in, &amp; then in a hotel with all these people, it
kept going back &amp; forth. When I woke up, my hands were red &amp; my
face was paler than normal. Throughout the day I heard my name being called
by a little girl, &amp; once I looked at the stairs, I saw a blue green
&amp; purple mixture type thing in the form of a person peeking around
the wall.</b>
<br><b>The second encounter; {still happens periodically.} In my room there
is this one corner I am absolutely afraid to go by, because I keep seeing
a man standing there, blood all over the place, &amp; forever creeping
forward into the rest of the room. He is holding an axe, various deep wounds
&amp; small wounds &amp; a noose around his neck. He looks like he went
through hell or some type of suicidal rampage. I walk around the room;
he follows me with his eyes, I cant tell his expression because when I
look closer he fades away. Only once he moved away from that corner, I
was at the door putting heavy stuff in front of it {because of the big
scardy cat I am when I'm alone.} My bed is against the same wall as the
door, &amp; the headboard is straight across from the area this guy stands
at. So anyways...he comes over to me &amp; stands by the bed, shaking his
head at me. Then all of a sudden blood appears on my bed, &amp; he lays
down on it on his tummy hands under his chin, like a child. I move away
&amp; walk towards the playroom door {I have an attatched room to my bedroom,
its like a sunroom} I stood there even though I was still hearing the noises
downstairs.</b>
<br><b>Actually I just remembered one more experience but this is already
too long, if your interested in any more please contact me or whatever,
thanks for your time sorry its so long.</b>

<br><b>2 Stories To Tell</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: SAXCHIC77@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>Hello, Im Nikki. I am in highschool. I have two stories if that's
ok. They're short. Well one, when my mother was just married to my dad
they were living upstairs in my great-grandma's house. One night my mom
woke up and saw a figure standing in front of her bed. She said she thought
she was dreaming. She said the "thing" looked like a person with a sheet
over them but a sheet you could sort of see through. She saw that it was
moving towards her so she sat up and tried to wake my dad...he didn't budge.
She started cusing at it a few times and then it went away. P.S. she moved
out 3 weeks later. My Aunt saw the same thing in that house years earlier.
This was about maybe in 1988 aroung spring. My grandma was very old and
said she didn't experience anything, but it only appeared when my mom,
or my aunt was in the house. I get chills just thinking my mom actually
saw something. Thanks for reading. You can email me to respond to my story.</b>

<p><b>In 2002 it was the morning of the 12th of July and as I woke I noticed
someone on the end of my bed!!</b>
<br><b>This was six days before my birthday and I wondered for a second
if they had come 2 say happy birthday!!</b>
<br><b>The woman sat with her hands in her lap and stared staight forward
as if she was in a trans I wasn't frightened at all I was more curious.
The woman was in her late 40's and was only visible from the knees up as
I rubbed my eyes 2 make sure I was not sleeping the woman stood up and
disappeared.This all happened in the time of 5 mins but 2 me it seemed
alot longer.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Night Mist</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Johnson.Huang@VerizonWireless.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>this happened when I was still in high school a few years ago...</b>
<br><b>I live in Houston, Texas, and a few days before graduating from
high school</b>
<br><b>one of my best friends commited suicide. We were all supposed to
go to the</b>
<br><b>University of Texas; the group of us have all known each other since
grammer</b>
<br><b>school. The reasons behind my friend committing suicide was still
unclear at</b>
<br><b>the time, not even his girlfriend knew why.</b>
<br><b>The night after graduation, the remaining friends really didn't
have any</b>
<br><b>spirit to celebrate, and so we just hung out at the pool hall and
sang on</b>
<br><b>the karaoke machine. I left around 2:00 am, and went home. Now comes
the</b>
<br><b>really odd part.</b>
<br><b>Going home, I had to take this really long stretch of road. The
neighborhood</b>
<br><b>that I lived in was in development, and was situated in the middle
of no</b>
<br><b>where. If anyone knows about Houston, from Dairy Ashford, break
a right on</b>
<br><b>Eldridge and just follow the long stretch of road for about 10 to
15 minutes</b>
<br><b>and you'll see my old neighborhood on the left: Twin Lakes.</b>
<br><b>As I was saying, on Eldridge, it only takes about 10 to 15 minutes,
and</b>
<br><b>there's no street lamps, and the road winds left and right, with
your</b>
<br><b>occasional road-kills. I remember that night, it was clear, and
the air felt</b>
<br><b>crisp and humidity-free. (Those of you who've been to Houston, or
down</b>
<br><b>south, will know the significance of a humidity-free day.) About
a quarter</b>
<br><b>of a way down Eldridge, a heavy mist seemed to envelop my entire
line of</b>
<br><b>sight, and no cars were on the road, which was odd, even on Eldridge.
For</b>
<br><b>some reason, I had a chilled feeling about the whole scene.</b>
<br><b>All of a sudden, I couldn't hear too well on my radio, and all I
heard was</b>
<br><b>static. I just turned off the radio and used my cd player instead.
As I was</b>
<br><b>driving, I felt as if I was driving in circles, because I kept on
seeing the</b>
<br><b>same road-kill. I got real scared from here and turned the volume
real high</b>
<br><b>and just drove faster. But still I saw nothing different, and still
no one</b>
<br><b>on the road.</b>
<br><b>In Asian culture, this sounds mist that I'm seeing, and the fact
that I'm</b>
<br><b>seemingly stuck in a loop is called being blinded by ghosts. I've
never</b>
<br><b>experienced this before, but have heard about this before.</b>
<br><b>At this point, I've been driving for the better part of half an
hour. I even</b>
<br><b>tried driving in the other direction. In my own defence, I haven't
been</b>
<br><b>drinking, and no, I don't do drugs. =) I kept on praying and praying.</b>
<br><b>Suddenly, I saw this bright light on the side of the road. Because
of the</b>
<br><b>mist, this light appeared more like a halo. As I drove near this
light, it</b>
<br><b>appeared like a white car, with a person standing beside it wearing
white</b>
<br><b>clothes. Once I passed by it, the person staring back at me was
my friend,</b>
<br><b>the one who committed suicide just weeks ago. He was just smiling
back at</b>
<br><b>me, and I heard the words "wake up."</b>
<br><b>Once I heard those words, the fog broke, and my car was spinning
in circles,</b>
<br><b>still on Eldridge.</b>
<br><b>I don't think that I fell asleep on the road, because I've never
fallen</b>
<br><b>asleep while driving. I don't know what happened, and to this day,
I still</b>
<br><b>do not understand.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Never Knew Who</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: only1emmat@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>My name is Emma and i live in england.</b>
<br><b>my experiences started when we moved into our new house.</b>
<br><b>The first thing that happened was that my mum, sister and me returned
home after shopping one day to hear a wisphered voice saying "Emma, can
you hear me? can you hear me Emma?". We didn't think anything of it, thinking
maybe I had pressed a button on my mobile phone or maybe one of my friends
was in the house. We discovered there was no one home and my mobile phone
was off!</b>
<br><b>The second thing that happened was a few months later, I woke up
suddenly in the night when hearing someone shout my name to see a black
shadow of a man at the end of my bed.</b>
<br><b>The latest thing that has happened was that my mum was looking through
one of my bags to discover an 18 carrot gold diamond ring in my bag, not
knowing how it got in there we rang my friends to see if it might be one
of their parents or family memebers rings. We never found out whoes it
was!!</b>

<p><b>These encounters happens during the 90's. I was 20 then, working
at a fastfood restaurant (known worldwide) and proudly say one of the pioneers.The
first encounter happens on August 1990, it was about&nbsp; 2am when the
closing team finished their job cleaning up the store. Lights off. Doors
locked. Everybody's out. Then the lobby person remembers that he forgot
his cleaning materials at the play area (playland) which located outside
the store.He went to fetch his cleaning materials but also immediately
return, shaking and frightened. When the other crew got him calmed, he
said that he saw the apple pie tree (made of concrete) get alive, with
fiery red eyes looking at him. The crew then went to see the tree but they
only saw the concrete figure of it. The next day the poor lobby person
didn't able to go to work, so scared that he had a fever and he requested
a working schedule anytime except in a closing shift. A few weeks later
another closing-lobby person experienced a scary encounter at the playland
too. While cleaning the area, he saw a bloody disembodied&nbsp; arm crawling
on the floor. With all these encounters at the playland, most of the closing
team refuses to be assigned as a lobby person.</b>
<br><b>The second encounter: On the first anniversary of the store March
1991. We the "openers" or opening team came to work very early than the
usual time, due to the preparation of the anniversary.It was 4am and we
are waiting for our managers when suddenly I saw a lady wearing an old,
long immaculately white gown (old because of its style) came in or I should
say came through the front entrance door (we're near the side door) walking
going to the store's front counter, then she just disappeared. I just kept
silence, passing it off as lack of sleep since I woke up 2:30 am. But at
the end of our shift my co-crew told me that she saw something while we
are waiting for our managers, before telling me what she saw I told her
about the lady in white gown and she was so shocked how I knew about it
since she kept her silence too. That confirms that I, we, really saw a
ghost.</b>
<br><b>It was my first month as a Management Trainee when the third encounter
(and my second) happened. Still an opener, my shift was about to be finish
so I am preparing for a turn-over for the next shift manager. I'm doing
an inventory on the frozen products at the crew room when I asked one of
the kitchen crew to count the products inside the walk-in-freezer, since
I am not feeling well that time. So I gave the freezer key to Susan and
proceeded to what I'm doing at the crew room's table,alone,&nbsp; my back
facing the freezer door. After a while I heard someone&nbsp; coming and
asked me how am I feeling. Without looking and judging</b>
<br><b>by his voice, it was Sir Rainier, i replied to him " a little bit
bad". I heard him came in and got out of the freezer without looking at
him again. Then I heard loud bangings coming from inside the freezer and
when I turned around I saw it was locked, and the freezer door handle is
moving, like for whoever was inside tries to open the door. So fr&nbsp;&nbsp;
there I called Sir Rainier for the key and told him that he locks Susan
inside since he is the last person I knew who came inside the freezer.
Then Susan pops up behind me saying "I'm here", and handling me the keys.
We open the door, look inside and there's nobody there. We hurriedly stepp
out of the freezer,frightened. The temperature of that freezer normally
reads 0 up to -2, but on that moment it reads -11. And also Sir Rainier
told me that he haven't gone to the freezer yet for the whole period of
our shift since he is the Counter Manager on that day.</b>
<br><b>These occurrences were reported to the owner-operator of the store
of course, and we learned from her the history of the lot or ground where
the restaurant is standing.They bought the land (1000 sq.m wide) including
what's in it. Trees and very very old house from the Spanish Period (way
back from 1940's) When they torn down the house to start the construction
of the restaurant, they discovered a secret door at the basement leading
to an underground tunnel, some human skeletons, old newspaper (from the
early 1900). The house was said to be first occupied by Spanish Officials
and soldiers and the underground tunnel was served to be a torture chamber
of somesort. It was also once lived by the town's most beautiful maiden
and found out that the store's anniversary was also the exact birthday
of the said beautiful maiden. Which I believed to be the lady in white
gown we saw on the store's anniversary day. From the torn house they had
salvaged some good wwoods and ballusters. The woods was used as store's
beams and the ballusters were also made to be a perfect decorations at
the store's side lobby.</b>
<br><b>I am 34 now, married with two kids and happily residing here in
Japan. The fastfood restaurant have 3 other chains on the same town now.
Everytime I take a vacation in the Philippines, I never fail to visit the
store and asking the crew and managers (which are all new faces to me)
if they are encountering weird things,which they confirms but I will not
elaborate on it since I was not working anymore at the store of what we
called M01( I worked for 8 years) when those encounters occurs.</b><b></b>

<p><b>well this happen not that long ago mayb like it was in december of
last yr.</b>
<br><b>We were on vacation @ mexico. So after xmas we decided 2 take a
tour of Jalisco and Guanajuato. On the way 2 Jalisco we had 2 go through
many areas which were desserted. Since my cousin is able to c dead ppl
and can wat has happen in the past she started telling me about wat was
going on. At 1 point we had a spirit follow us it was so scary cuz i was
using a camara 2 c it. It didnt stop chasing us until like 10 mins later.
We got pretty freaked out. Another thing was that on the same place there
was somthing that was not human and was a threat 2 humans good thing i
did not ask more questions on that. In Guanajuato it was full w/ paranormal&nbsp;
activity. We had a few experiences w/ cold spots specially in the dungeons.</b>
<br><b>In the room I was staying we also had another xperience which was
quite funny. We had a spirit in the room and 1 morning it decided 2 make
its presence known and dropped somthing on my sisters head.</b><b></b>

<p><b>&nbsp;Biltmore Hotel</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:kdbriss@email.uophx.edu</b><b></b>
<p><b>My husband and I stayed at the Biltmore for two nights recently.&nbsp;
We toured the hotel our first night there on our own and decided to see
how far up in the tower we could travel.&nbsp; Only one elevator goes all
the way to the 15th floor so we got in and hit the button for the 15th.&nbsp;
We went all the way up and got off the elevator.&nbsp; There was only one
room at the top and I could hear a TV playing.&nbsp; We didn't want to
disturb whoever was staying there so we headed for the 14th floor.&nbsp;
My husband held the elevator while I took a look around.&nbsp; There was
only one door on that floor as well.&nbsp; So we went to the 13th floor
(and we both thought it was odd the hotel even had a 13th floor).&nbsp;
I got off again while my husband waited inside. Another door and that was
it. We continued down to the 10th floor and then on to the lobby area.</b>
<br><b>The next night we sat in on some storytelling in the lobby and found
out that unless you have a special access card you cannot get to the 13th,
14th or 15th floors. According to the storyteller, there is a ghost on
the 13th floor (the 13th and 14th are one room) and sometimes "allows"
people access. He's also been known to turn the sprinklers on people when
he doesn't want them there.</b>
<br><b>I tried for the remaining two days to gain access to one of the
top three floors again, but with no success. I did however have the crap
scared out of me by a maintenance man. I was in the elevator when it started
going up. I hadn't pressed any buttons so I was a little freaked. Anyway,
it stopped on the 14th floor and there was a maintenance man standing there.&nbsp;
What can you do at that point but laugh.</b>

<p><b>March 26, 2004, me and my cousin Amber were walking through the field
near our houses. It was daylight and we were near the woods. Then we stopped
to take a breake from walking and sat on a fallen log. When we got up we
heard something fall from a tree behind us. When we turned to look, we
saw someone run away and they just seem to dissapear into the woods. It
kept on happening for about half an hour. When we were walking back to
our houses and we saw something come out of the woods and fly away.</b>
<br><b>About a month later, we were walking in the same field and we saw
it again but this time it was just standing there but as we got closer
it disssapeared. Now, in the place that it was standing, there is a fallen
tree that resembles someone standing there. Just last night as we got near
the tree we heard someone talking and then someone or something jumped
out of the woods and ran away. We have never gone back there since.</b>

<br><b>Many Strange Things</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: kevsavuk@ntlworld.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>My name is Kevin Savage. ( 47 )&nbsp; I'm average in every way,&nbsp;
happily married with children,&nbsp; a craftsman gardener by trade and
a very keen motorcyclist.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Back in 1982 I was living
with Beverley,&nbsp; in Swinton, Lancashire UK.&nbsp; Bev was the double
of the lovely Carolyn Jones, who played Morticia Addams in the old black
and white, television show,&nbsp; The Addams Family...</b>
<br><b>Bev was a practicing witch,&nbsp; very spiritual,&nbsp; very much
a free spirit.&nbsp; I always joked that she put a spell on me when we
met,&nbsp; curse that gypsy wench !&nbsp;&nbsp; We were very happy.</b>
<br><b>Several strange occurrences happened during our several years together.&nbsp;
Lights would go on and off, sometimes when we were in the room,&nbsp; sometimes
when we weren't.&nbsp; The electric cooker would turn itself on also.&nbsp;
None of these things phased of worried us,&nbsp; it was just strange, interesting
even.&nbsp;&nbsp; One day in the winter of 82, I was working on a Godforsaken,
windswept field,&nbsp; high in the Lancashire hills.&nbsp; The sky was
grey and the temperature was well below freezing.&nbsp;&nbsp; My college
and I,&nbsp; ( Gary Sofield, )&nbsp; were cutting a hedge.&nbsp; I said
aloud, around 2pm,&nbsp; " This is mind-numbing.&nbsp; I wish to God I
was home, in the warm,&nbsp; away from this stupid job...'&nbsp;&nbsp;
With a sigh,&nbsp; I simply carried on and forgot all about my heartfelt
plea.</b>
<br><b>I arrived home at around 5pm,&nbsp; to be greeted by a wistful Bev,&nbsp;
who asked,&nbsp;&nbsp; ' Did you come home today ? '&nbsp; She answered
her own question by saying that at around 2pm, she was making the beds,&nbsp;
and she heard the front door open.</b>
<br><b>She knew it was me,&nbsp; ( no one else had a key, ) but was surprised
not to have heard my motorcycle.&nbsp; I apparently walked upstairs, clearly
heard with my heavy bike boots on,&nbsp; and looked round the door into
the bedroom.&nbsp; I smiled.&nbsp; Bev said Hi,&nbsp; and asked what I
was doing home so early ?&nbsp; I went out of the bedroom and went into
the bathroom.&nbsp;&nbsp; After a few minutes, Bev wondered what was taking
me so long, and came into the bathroom to see if I was o.k.&nbsp;&nbsp;
No one there !</b>
<br><b>The bathroom was empty...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I
have no recollection of actually going home,&nbsp; I wished to be home
at that time,&nbsp; but in my mind, I just carried on working.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I believe Bev implicitly,&nbsp; if she said I was there,&nbsp; then I was
there. I was solid, and make noise, I even moved the bedroom door, and
was heard to open and shut the bathroom door. All we ever said about it,&nbsp;
was,&nbsp; there are more things in Heaven and Earth,&nbsp; and left it
at that...</b>
<br><b>Other lesser things happened.&nbsp; Our cat died, yet came back
and was seen by friends,&nbsp; ( but curiously not by us, ) walking at
our feet.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One night I was again in the bathroom,&nbsp;
cleaning my teeth and running the bath at the same time.</b>
<br><b>It was pretty steamy in there,&nbsp; and while I was bending over
the sink,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bev came in and affectionately squeezed my
shoulder.&nbsp; I smiled and carried on.&nbsp; The only thing was,&nbsp;
when I turned around, no one was there !&nbsp;&nbsp; I asked Bev had she
been in the bathroom at all, and she replied no...&nbsp;&nbsp; This happened
again,&nbsp; within a few days, but the second time I had my back to a
wall, and unlike the first time,&nbsp; I jumped out of my skin !&nbsp;&nbsp;
I was only shocked for a second, and as with each and every occurrence
or happening,&nbsp; we were curious,&nbsp; not frightened.</b>
<br><b>More recently my father died.&nbsp; He was ill with cancer and in
a hospice.&nbsp; Despite his illness, he was on very little medication,
and was able to walk around and was perfectly lucid.&nbsp;&nbsp; A week
before his death,&nbsp; we were talking and he mentioned,&nbsp; very matter
of factly,&nbsp; that my grandfather,&nbsp; ( his father ) had come to
visit him the other day.&nbsp; I replied that it was just as well it was
my grandfather ( who had been dead for 20 years )&nbsp; that came to visit,&nbsp;
because if it had been someone else's grandfather visit,&nbsp; why, that
would have been silly !!!&nbsp;&nbsp; I have no doubt at all that my father
met my grandfather again,&nbsp; the day before.</b>
<br><b>For everything I have written,&nbsp; I can vouch for it's factuality.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I wouldn't presume to have any answers however.</b>
<br><b>Several other things have happened over the years,&nbsp; all of
which are interesting.</b>
<br><b>I don't intend to go anytime yet,&nbsp; ( assumably shot in bed,
aged 97 by a jealous husband )&nbsp; but when that time comes,&nbsp; I'd
be very happy to see both my father and grandfather again.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Who knows...</b><b></b>

<br><b>The Experiences at my House</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: sarahtrala@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Many things have happened at my house, but no one has ever died here
on this land.</b>
<br><b>When I was younger the door in my bedroom that leds to my bathroom
would open when no one was there to open it, and sometimes I'd hear a laugh.</b>
<br><b>When I'm on the computer in my mom's office I see a siver light
reflection next to me with no one behind me.</b>
<br><b>I get sivers a lot and my dogs stair off into space, and when I
take a picture things show up. I always feel someone watching me.</b>
<br><b>I see things that have happened in the past or will happen. Like
one time I saw a blond girl get kidnapped by someone, then it happened.</b>
<br><b>In my past life I think I might of been a goth because that's all
I dress like now, but I'm not a really big fan of goths.</b>
<br><b>I always know there is something in a place I look at but no one

looked out the curtains.&nbsp; It was a bright sunny day perfect for playing.&nbsp;
I shut the curtains, turned around and right above my brothers bead was
a witch's head and it was laughing at me. I got freaked out (of course)
ran out of the room and into my parents room.&nbsp; Jumped up on the bead
in-between my parents and stared out the door thinking that this thing
was coming for me. My dad woke up but my mom did not. My dad noticing that
im very freaked out is asking me "whats wrong, whats wrong". I didnt answer
him, I just kept looking out the door. then all of a sudden from the other
side of the door, opposite of the way I came in.&nbsp; This beautiful lady
peeked her head around the door.&nbsp; She looked around the room, looked
at me, smiled and walked past the door&nbsp; towards my room. She was dressed
all in white, with a very bright glow around her. I knew at that time that
she was my guardian angel.&nbsp; My dad later had told me that he had also

<p><b>The Haunted Farm House</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Katbanshee1@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Here's another one. When my husband and I were first married, we
rented a farm house while we were looking for a place to live in Minnesota.
The farmer still had cows on the property, and all we had to do was let
him know when a calfing was starting. We had a black cat and a black Labrador
Retriever, and everything was pretty cool there, except I didn't like the
feeling of the upstairs or the basement, which had a root cellar, and was
kind of dank. We had very little furniture, so settled most of our things
on the main floor and the bedroom there. The first thing that happened
was the phone kept ringing. This was in the early 70's when they still
used the four-pronged phone jacks to plug in your phone. The phone was
in a little nook by the entryway and was NOT plugged in. The phone in the
bedroom was. This particular phone would ring and ring (not the one in
the bedroom), and when we picked it up there was nothing but dead air.
We threw it out. The next thing that happened was I would hear a loud thump
upstairs above the livingroom at odd times during the day or night. The
only things that were up there were my husband's two six foot tall speakers
that he used for his gigs when he sang at local hotels and with his friends.
I would go up there to see if one of them fell over, and they were still
upright. I would hear footsteps on the stairs and in one of the bedrooms
upstairs at times, and hear footsteps walking up the stairs. We always
kept the door to the upstairs closed, because I didn't like it up there.
One night, I was sitting in the bedroom downstairs with the dog and cat
watching TV when my husband came in and asked me what I wanted. I asked
him what he was talking about, and he told me I was just in the bathroom
and he heard me sigh over his shoulder while he was combing his hair. I
told him I hadn't moved, and neither had the animals. The next thing that
happened had to do with the lights and the front door, which we had never
been able to unlock. It was worked with a skeleton key, and the key would
never budge, so we used the back door by the garage to come and go. One
day, I was driving into the drive (it was about 5/8ths of a mile long),
and when I turned in, all the lights were off in the house. There was a
bend in the driveway, and there was a barn there that blocked the view
of our house for a second when you went around it. When I saw the house
again after rounding the barn, all the lights were on in the entryway (that
we never used because we couldn't unlock the front door), which kind of
scared me. I had my dog with me, and we went in through the back door,
and went through the house into the entryway. Nobody was there. I checked
the light switch, which was in the "on" position, and turned off the light.
We checked the rest of the house. Nobody was there. The dog wasn't acting
weird, and was kind of curious about why I was a bit scared. Then for some
odd reason, I tried the skeleton key in the front door, and it unlocked
like it was supposed to. Like it had never been stuck. From that day forward,
the door locked and unlocked like nothing had ever been wrong with it.
I found out later that the woman that used to live in that house with the
farmer we rented it from had gotten cancer and had had to move into town
to be closer to the hospital, before she died. I think her spirit went
back to the house (the farmer had built it for her), and it was she who
was messing around with us. I think she came to like us there, and the
door was finally unlockable after she saw that we cared and were taking
good care of the place. I wasn't afraid of the basement or the upstairs
anymore, and the vibes had changed from eerie to acceptable, like we were
living in sync. After the door unlocked, nothing more happened. We moved
from there after living there for about seven months, and all that stuff
happened in the first three months we were there. If you want to Email
me about this, please use "Shadowlands" in the subject line or I won't
open it.</b><b></b>

<p><b>The Albino Farm</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: wingo86_9@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>i am going to tell you one of the scariest experiences of my life.
many have</b>
<br><b>experienced the same thing that i am about to tell you.</b>
<br><b>in my home town there was an old farm that was owned by a family
with the</b>
<br><b>disorder in their pigments in which we would call them albino. they
were</b>
<br><b>tormentedand made fun of which i guess made them do what they did
which was</b>
<br><b>kill a number of people. i had never heard of it until 2 of my friends</b>
<br><b>wantedto go there. i had no idea what was going on while we were
there</b>
<br><b>because they waited until after we left to tell me where we were
and the</b>
<br><b>story behind it( i guess as an experiment to see if it was all a
mind game).</b>
<br><b>well we went to the bridge at the base of the hill that goes up
to the house</b>
<br><b>and they put the car in neutral. we waited there forever and it
took a long</b>
<br><b>time for this to happen, but i swear it did. the car started moving
forward</b>
<br><b>up this hill and you could hear weird sounds. like someone was straining
and</b>
<br><b>then all of a sudden the car stopped and shut off. we tried forever
to get</b>
<br><b>it to start back up, but it wouldnt turn. it was silent like the
starter was</b>
<br><b>out of it( even though she had just installed a new one)</b>
<br><b>we tried to call one of our friends to come help us, but all you
could hear</b>
<br><b>on the phone was fuzzy swquealing sounds and every once in a while
you would</b>
<br><b>here weird deep chanting voices. the radio was acting really screwy(
fuzzing</b>
<br><b>out and what not.we finally got out and in front of the car and
pushed it</b>
<br><b>til it was off of the bridge. it then started back up. the next
morning i</b>
<br><b>went to put something in the trunk of the car and i saw 6 handprints
on the</b>
<br><b>back, but they were much larger than any of ours and her father
lives in</b>
<br><b>another state so it wasnt him. i had no idea of the story of the
albino farm</b>
<br><b>or even where it was til afterwards so there was no way that my

<p><b>My Ghosts</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Izabell162@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>i have had a few *ghostly* experiences.</b>
<br><b>my first one was when i was very little. about 4.</b>
<br><b>(i dont remember but i have been told)</b>
<br><b>i was at my grans staying for the night because</b>
<br><b>my parents had gone out somewhere. when it was about</b>
<br><b>11 pm (my gran spoiled me horribly and let me stay up veery late</b>
<br><b>when i was so little)</b>
<br><b>we went up to bed. my mum always insisted i sleep in the front</b>
<br><b>bedroom alone. but my gran liked having me in her room when my</b>
<br><b>grandad was away (he was in the navy.)</b>
<br><b>anyways. i was at the top of the stairs. they have the kind of stairs
that,l they have</b>
<br><b>the stairs at the bottom. then they have a small landing with no
doors on that floor</b>
<br><b>then the stairs turn and go back the way they came but going up
and there</b>
<br><b>is a balcony type banister veiwing over the first stairs</b>
<br><b>(if that made sence at all)</b>
<br><b>i was looking over the banister and saw a man,</b>
<br><b>walking up the stairs.</b>
<br><b>i said *gran, who is that man coming up the stairs*</b>
<br><b>my gran answered that she could not see a man</b>
<br><b>i insisted that there *is a grey man walking up the stairs.*</b>
<br><b>after that my gran was so scared that she had me sleep in her room.</b>
<br><b>another night, me and my mum where alone in the house.</b>
<br><b>my dad was away (he was also in the navy)</b>
<br><b>and my mum was in bed reading. she</b>
<br><b>heard footsteps coming up the stairs. she went to investagate</b>
<br><b>and saw that it was me, walking up the stairs....</b>
<br><b>she went back into her room and i followed. she asked</b>
<br><b>me what i was doing going down the stairs at this time of night</b>
<br><b>and i said *i had a nightmare. but its ok cuz the man took me down</b>
<br><b>and got me a drink. he was singing.*</b>
<br><b>my mum was quite freaked out by this and asked what man was that</b>
<br><b>*the one standing in the door.*.......</b>
<br><b>usually i would put this down to imaginary friendism but</b>
<br><b>my younger cousin (now nine)</b>
<br><b>when she was four sat on my grans stairs to get her shoes on.</b>
<br><b>and she used to look up and wave at someone.........</b><b></b>

<p><b>My Cousin's Claims</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Dragonlancewars@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;Well, this is a bit odd coming from a skeptic, but here it
is. Last Christmas I went with my family to Miami where we stayed at my
cousin's house. She and I shared a room, and late at night we were sitting
around when I felt the impulse to ask,"What is the scariest expirience
you've ever had?" She smiled and began telling me of three things. Story
1: In Miami, there is an old two or three story&nbsp; house lost in the
fields and country roads. The windows are boarded up, the paint is chipping,
and the house has an eerie structure that will set your heart thumping
with one glance. She told me that her sister, Musa, and some friends had
gone to the house to check it out, having heard it was haunted. They went
at night, of course, and once they had gotten out of the car they stood
there and looked at the house. Musa wanted to leave, and as they were just
about to leave they saw a figure on the balcony: a nurse. "Thank you, have
a nice day,"she said. The house used to be a hospital for children, but
not all patients who went in ever came out. We drove by the house the next
night because I wanted to see it, thinking that it wouldn't phase me, but
as we passed it Patty stopped the car and I looked up at the old house.
I wanted to scream as a shiver ran through me and my heart skipped a few
beats. I closed my eyes, uttering,"Patty, go. Please go. Come on, go!"
Story 2: In Orlando, there is a hotel with 13 floors. An old elevator leads
to the forbidden 13th floor, which has a presidential suite and some other
forgotten halls. As Musa and her friends went up there, only a few dared
to get out of the elevator. Those few stood in the hall when they heard
voices coming from the presidential suite. Placing their ears to the door,
they could faintly hear the sound of a party. That was when the voices
stopped, and the door began to become wavy. It continued to wave, and,
scared to death, the teenagers leapt across the hall and into the elevator
just as the doors slammed shut. Story 3: Story 3 takes place in my cousin's
old house. The house was new, and she lived there with her mom and her
sister. Her sister's room had a closet next to the bed, and from here a
dark esscence loomed about. As it turned out, Musa soon found that this
strange feeling was an evil spirit, or so she said, was unable to sleep
in the room by herself.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Me and the Paranormal, We're Like Old Buddies, Without Beer.</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: harr1739@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Okay, so I'm one of those people--you know, the one of the annoying
ones that always seems to have something wierd happen to them no matter
where they go, or what they do.&nbsp; That's me.&nbsp; I had originally
decided to check out your website per my husband's advice and see what
kind of wierd stuff happens to others-- you know, the whole voyuer vibe.&nbsp;
But now I've caved and decided that I do want to share a few of my experiances
after all, something I almost never do. Mostly because I don't like getting
the stink eye and the pitying cluck from some good, God-fearing citizen
who believes in the holy ghost, but not normal "Hi, my name is Joe" ghosts.&nbsp;
That, and the fact that after over 20 years of seeing a whole lot of things
that most people don't, or won't, I've trained myself to be quite the cynic--I
even question and discredit myself on a regular basis (it's the stuff of
identity crisis, I know).&nbsp; Anyway, all that aside...</b>
<br><b>My family lived in a typical, tri-level house in quiet suburbia,
Colorado.&nbsp; The house was built specifically for our family in 1975,
thereby making us the only ones to hve ever lived there untill the day
they sold it.&nbsp; We lived in that house for 18 years, and from the time
we moved in untill we sold it in 1994, there was paranormal acvtivity.&nbsp;
My mom, who utterly, and totaly denies the possibility of ghosts, like
to tell a story of being alone in the house with my 2 year old brother
and myself (still a newborn) and hearing what sounded like someone breaking
into the basement.&nbsp; She knew she couldn't get out of the house with
two little ones in tow, so she barricaded us in the master bedroom and
called the cops.&nbsp; When they arrived, no one was in the house but us,
and there was no indication of anyone having had been anywhere near the
house.&nbsp; At the time, ours was the only house in about a three block
area, so it would have been real obvious had there been someone in the
near vicinity.&nbsp; That was the first occurance, that I know of.</b>
<br><b>By the time I was 6, I was seeing "things" throughout the house,
the typical corner of your eye glimmer, but also, I would see a man standing
at the end of the hallway directly down from my bedroom.&nbsp; He always
looked like an sillouhette of a man, with a dim light behind him.&nbsp;
I would watch him for awhile and then he would just start to dim and fade
into himself.&nbsp; As if he was being pulled into an orb-ish shape, then
he would be gone.&nbsp; This man appeared to me about once or twice a week
for as long as I lived in the house.&nbsp; I was the only one who saw this
particular apparition, or spirit.</b>
<br><b>However, my father and brother were aquainted with another spirit
in the house.&nbsp; This spirit was obviously a woman and she liked to
spend her time making rooms smell like old, dusty perfume and calling out
members of the family's names.&nbsp; Even my mom would get called occasionally,
but she always claimed it was one of us playing jokes on her.&nbsp; This
lady spirit was always announced--to me anyway--by the sound of a few notes
of orchestral music, kind of like an old phonograph sound.</b>
<br><b>My father also had alot of problems with another vocal, olfactory
type spirit (maybe the same?) who didn't approve of his sleeping habits.&nbsp;
My dad is a horrible insomniac, with an ugly snore that sounds like a bullhorn,
or a jake break.&nbsp; So, whenever my mom could take no more, my dad would
have to play musical beds--going from couch to couch.&nbsp; After my brother
went to college, my dad usually found himself sleeping in my brother's
room on those nights.&nbsp; Well, apparently this particular ghost didn't
like anyone but my brother in his room and my dad had several bad occasions
when he would wake up to a smell that he described as "bad eggs, B.O. and
something dead, all at once" followed by alot of grunts, low moaning and
the bed shaking just enough to scare him out of the room.&nbsp; We laughingly
used the "beans for supper" defense, but it was no joke, it really scared
my dad.</b>
<br><b>There was also another spirit, ghost, being, or something in the
house that I actually rarely talk about with anyone but my husband because
it really scares me, now and then.&nbsp; Whatever this one was, it didn't
like me at all and it let me know physically.&nbsp; I was pushed down stairs,
when no one was even on the landing with me.&nbsp; It also liked to push
my head down while I was sleeping, so that my face would be smashed into
the pillow.&nbsp; This only happened twice, but that was enough.&nbsp;
It slammed doors, turned lights on and off, threw glasses off a wall mounted
shelf behind a wet bar in the basement.&nbsp; It even moved a knife in
front of a highschool friend who was (ironically) carving a pumpkin for
a Halloween party.&nbsp; Usually, if this presence was going to start messing
with me, I would first hear kind of a low growl, or grumble.&nbsp; I learned
to run like a bat out of hell (no pun intended) when I heard that noise,
let me tell you.</b>
<br><b>Since I've moved out of that house, I've had plenty of other expieriances,
like a skipping, singing , see through, 6 year old apparition that scared
the living daylights out of my poor three- year-old nephew, and (what I
call) a "psyhchic residue" spirit that liked to do ghostly (and loud)woodwork
at three a.m. on a hundred year old woodworking table in the basement of
a rental house I lived in.&nbsp; I also see, on occasion a spirit of a
woman who likes to carry a stack a books around my husband's work.&nbsp;
Where I live now there is a very mellow presence that likes to touch my
back and likes the house to be kept in order.&nbsp; He likes the computer
screen just so, or the t.v. remotes put out of site, and if I don't do
it--he will.&nbsp;&nbsp; But he, or she is very calm, and doesn't seem
to want much, so we get along just fine.&nbsp; I also saw alot of other
stuff as a kid, in schools, or hotels, or other's houses.&nbsp; But I think
the house I grew up in was definately the "spookiest".&nbsp; I tried, a
few years after we moved out, to see if the new owners had sensed anything
wierd since moving in, but when I asked they got real quiet and said the
typical--"they didn't know what I could be talking about".&nbsp; I didn't
get the stink-eye or the pitying cluck though, so who knows.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Haunted Trailor</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: secret@alaska.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>This haunting seems to have started in 1997-98. It is located in
a trailer park called Penland Park, space #107. My ex-girlfriend and I
were living there with our 3 sons. We had first moved in in October 1995.
It wasn't until either the summer of '97 or spring '98 that I noticed something
sinister had arrived, or was there all along, and for some reason decided
to show itself. Let me start with a description of the inside of the trailer.
It pretty much runs from east to west, with the front door on the southern
side of the trailer. Starting from the east end of the trailer you would
find my bedroom and located right next to it was the big bathroom. There
was two doorways into that bathroom. The other door led to our sons room.
As you continue west through the trailer, through our main bedroom door
you would be facing the living room and to the left( about 8 ft.)&nbsp;
would be the front door. Now if you had gone through the boys' bedroom
door, you would be facing the diding room with the kitchen just past it.
In between the kitchen and living room was a wall. On the west end of the
living room was the wall that divided a third bedroom I had converted to
a weight room. On the west end of the kitchen was a wall that divided the
kitchen and a small second bathroom that the cats had their litter box
in. The last room in the trailer was the laundry room, with a door leading
out to the west end of the trailer, into the yard. We had three cats, and
I always made sure that I closed both doors leding to the big bathroom,
so that the cats would not go in there and use our bath tub for their litter
box. It was morning time and I had woken up a few times because of the
early morning sunshine. I had fallen back asleep, when all of a sudden
there was loud crash coming from the big bathroom. I never got along with
the cats ( the only reason they were there was because of my girlfriend
at the time), and I automatically thought it was one of the cats that I
had maybe accidently trapped in the big bathroom. The crashing noise was
very loud, loud enough to make me practically jump out of my skin. My girlfriend
had also woken up. I went stomping into the bathroom expecting to see one
of the cats as I opened the door. Instead, there was no cat or cats to
be found, only our bathroom shelf with our bath towels scattered on the
bathroom floor. I looked under the sink which had doors to it, but found
no cats. I thought it was really weird, but just shrugged it off. The second
incident happened when I was home by myself. I was playing video games.
I was using headphones that were hooked up to the entertainment system
because I had gotten used to using them when my boys were trying to sleep.
For some reason, even though I was home by myself I was using the headphones
while playing the video games.</b>
<br><b>It was then that I felt a small gust of wind pass by me. At first
I thought maybe either the backdoor ( laundry room) or the window in the
small bedroom had been left open. Of course I&nbsp; checked and found no
open doors or windows. I was sitting there trying to figure it out and
then thought maybe it was a blast of air coming from the heater vents.
It wasn't that either. I decided to walk through the trailer to investigate
further, only to find that whatever had caused the gust of wind had also
blown a picture of one of our boys off the wall, without it knocking down
any of the collectibles that were stored underneath it. That was when I
was convinced there was something strange going&nbsp; on in that trailer.
Shortly thereafter, these episodes intensified. There were times when all
the lights would flicker and make a buzzing sound, not to mention all the
lights being turned off at night for bedtime only to wake up with all the
lights on. My brother-in-law witnessed one of those mist type apparitions
one night when he was watching movies by himself. According to him this
is what he saw. "I saw a mist with a round shape with tentacle like arms
extending from it. I could not take my eyes off of it. It was about ten
feet away. It felt like my hair was standing on end, my heart was beating
from the rush of adrenaline that was fueled by intense fear. I watched
this floating mist trave to the laundry room door and open it and this
dorr was not the type to open easily due to the dryer being such a tight
fit in the laundry room. This didi not end yet, as it closed the laundry
room door until it 'clicked'. It started to open again, and that is when
I broke out of my state of shock and ran into the weight room where my
mom and dad were sleeping."</b>
<br><b>There were many incidents that happened at this place ranging from
strangers walking in the front dorr and disappearing into my bedroom, to
weird voices coming through the speakers that were hooked up to the entertainment
center. I don't know the history of this trailer, or thius trailer park,
but will soon research that in the near futurre. Maybe i will have more
info in the future to share.</b>

<br><b>My True Ghost Stories</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Soccorstar45@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>My aunt passed away in October due to Pancreatic Cancer. I have
always believed in ghosts. She was in a coma shortly before she dies. My
mom was with her in California. While my sister and I were home in Massachusetts
we kept getting weird feelings when we were home. Sometimes I would see
something out of the corner of my eye. When my mom called we told her about
it and she didn't believe because she knows I read ghost stories and my
sister is afraid of everything. When she came home she went to her psychic.
She said that while my aunt was in a coma her spirit was at our house because
she never got a chance to see it. Next time your kids tell you somethings
different, believe them!</b><b></b>

<p><b>2 Experiences</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: lindseycartwright@apollotravel.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have 2 experiences to tell you about, the first regarding my mother
- She was sat at home, a few days afetr her father had died, and we were
all sat watching tv.</b>
<br><b>Suddenly, my mums hair 'ruffeled' on its own, she looked at me,
went white and started crying saying that someone or something had just
'ruffeled' her hair as if with a small child!!!</b>
<br><b>My experience was very strange, on New Years Day 2003, i had been
to visit my father, he wasnt there, and a neighbour came out saying that
the police had been!!!</b>
<br><b>I went to my mums for dinner, and called the police who said he
had been taken to prison - I called all prisons in the UK with no avail.</b>
<br><b>Later that night, myself and my boyfriend were sat at home, when
i felt very stange indeed and started to cry - at this point, i didnt know
that my father had died - 2days later there was a appeal in the local paper
appealing for me to come forward, i then found out that he had died christmas
day - I belive my father came to me new years day knowing i was looking
for him, to prompt me to keep looking.</b>
<br><b>A few weeks later, i went to a spiritual church of which my father
came to me - He told me to stop playing my new eminem cd that my sister
had bought for me for christmas on my way to work - The thing is, i worked
at huddersfield at the time, and no one was ever in the car with me so
no one could have known this - I actually said on a few occasions to my
mum that i could smell and sense my dad in the car with my.</b>
<br><b>At the spiritual church, he also told me to cut the silly tie i
had with my mum since he died - I was feeling guilty for not visiting my
dad more often, and felt i had to speak to my mum every day after he died
incase the same thing happened to her!!!</b>
