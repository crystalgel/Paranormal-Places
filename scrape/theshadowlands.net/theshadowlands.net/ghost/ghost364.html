<p class="MsoNormal">The Rocking chair</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: imalunaticgnome@yahoo.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Before I moved into the house on <st1:Street><st1:address>Willowbee
  Lane</st1:address></st1:Street>, I never had given the slightest thought to
paranormal activities, and had always dismissed it with a wave of the hand and
an offhand comment of how such things were scientifically impossible. However
all that changed a few years ago when myself and my newly acquired husband
decided to buy an old farm house in upstate <st1:State><st1:place>New York</st1:place></st1:State>.
</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The real-estate agent, while giving us a tour of the house,
had in fact related some disturbing information to us. She told us that about
twenty years ago a young woman who had lived there with her two sons and her
father (who apparently was an alcoholic as well as an abusive parent) had gone
missing. Her remains had never been found but there had been almost certain
proof that the father had murdered her, and was shortly there after tried, and
sentenced to 10 years in prison where he had died. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I thought nothing of this, except for the fact that one day
I might be gardening and dig up a little bit more then dirt. However this did
not stop us from buying the house, which was gorgeous, with green shutters, a
post and beam barn which was in good repair, and a drive that was lined in
grand old maple trees. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">However my friend, who was indeed a strong believer in the
super natural, strongly advised us that there might be what she called
&#8216;restless spirits&#8217; residing in the house. Again, me, being convinced there was
no such thing, did not take her warning seriously.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">After a long day of moving all our possessions into the
newly bought house, I had fallen asleep in what was soon to be the living room.
The movers had helped me bring in our couch and as well as an old rocking chair
we had found in the barn. Both my husband and I thought we might be able to
save the old thing, with was made of oak, and not damaged except for the fact
that the seat itself was no longer there. I was snoring away on the couch when
I awoke, drowsily to a consistent creaking. My husband, who was at work, and
the movers, who had long since gone home were absent, leaving me alone in the
house. As I looked around I noticed that the rocking chair was moving, as if
someone was in it.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Needless to say I was incredibly scared, and proceeded to
throw a book I had been reading at the chair before running out of the house. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">As the weeks passed, more and more of these types of things
would happen, all ending with me rather frightened. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Things would disappear, and reappear with out notice, some
of which were never there in the first place. Some of these items consisted of
a wide collections of women&#8217;s jewelry, that I occasionally would find in what
we found out later used to be a bedroom, though we converted it into a study. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I would hear knockings, doors would open and shut for no
apparent reason. We would occasionally hear the faint creaking of the rocking
chair, even though I had insisted it be placed back in the barn. Occasionally I
would hear hushed voices, and see flashes of what appeared to be figures out of
the corner of my eye.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">This behavior increased as time passed, till I was starting
to get used to it. I even admit to talking with the &#8216;spirit&#8217; whenever I was
alone in the house. I would always be rewarded with an abrupt cease in all
abnormal activity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">On the evening of the house warming party me and my husband
were holding my one of my friends came to me, in a state of anxiety. They said
they had been in the basement when they saw a women standing there, staring at
them then turning and vanishing. Myself and a few others hurried down to the basement,
where we looked all over, trying to find the women. What we did find was a
hidden cupboard with what later was confirmed to be the remains of Sue Hoover,
the women who disappeared nearly twenty years ago.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">After this finding the noises, and sightings immediately
stopped and we have yet to hear the slightly disturbing creak of the old
rocking chair, which eventually we moved back into the house and repaired.
However I will never forget my experiences that year, and never again doubt the
existence of spirits in this physical world again.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I've Always believed in ghosts</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I've some neat stories to tell</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">When my mother was growing up in <st1:place>Cebu</st1:place>,
<st1:country-region><st1:place>philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region> she
had Three major experiences Once, they found little silvery footprints in their
house.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">They lead from the door, to the bathroom, then up the
stairs.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">When she was older, she was taking exams and felt her desk
wiggle and lift a bit and felt a presence,but nothing scary.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">It was just saying Hello</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">When she was older, she once had to stay at the school
overnight with a classmate They made sure everything was locked, then went to
sleep.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Later that night they awoke to the yard dogs howling like
mad.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">When the dogs are howling, they say, ghosts are around In
the next room, they heard banging, and Cracking And fingernails against the
chalkboard The next morning, they found desks and cabinets tossed about the
room.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The doors were locked and bolted, windows barred. There is
no other explanation There have been four seperate events in my house that I
know of, but I do not believe my house is haunted. My dad had a friend, a good
friend, who had committed suicide.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">One night, my father heard a little movement downstairs. The
next morning, he found our water jug out on the counter. No one in the house
could have moved it. He also says that he felt the spirit of his friend, for a
moment, as though his friend had come to say goodbye.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My mother says that she has felt my grandfather again, just
for a moment. She says he was checking up on her I too have felt my gandfather.
It was just a presence, gentle and kind, and only for a moment.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I think he was checking up on me too.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My final is more interesting.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I was reading one night, when I suddenly felt a chill cold,
and grew afraid, but I thought it was the book.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">soon afterwards, I could see, out of the corner of my eye, a
black mass in the hallway, outside my door.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Naturally I grew more afraid. I could feel the presence
growing, hovering outside my door. I felt a subtle malavolence, a quiet
evil.When I could take it no longer, I went to my door, and out of fear and
anger, slammed it hard. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I just wanted to be left alone. It left. At the time, I did
not think it was a ghost, but after reading some of the page's stories, I know
it was one.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">My Sister's Experience</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I am a great fan of your site and have submitted some of my
own stories. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The other day, I remembered an experience my sister, Kirsty,
had many years ago.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although I was not a
direct witness to this, I was there when she came home in hysterics.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was in such a state we all thought she
had been attacked and we could not get any sense out of her.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The story goes like this: </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Kirsty had been walking home from a friend's house down a
long lane called <st1:Street><st1:address>Langley Lane</st1:address></st1:Street>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the right hand side of this lane there was
a field which was used for cattle from a local farm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was also a brook with a large tree
hanging over it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The summer before (I think this happened later in the year
as it was dark quite early) a young man had hanged himself from this tree
during a fit of depression.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I recall
that other people have hanged themselves there, at least one other that I know
of.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I think I was about 16 at the time (I am now 36) and Kirsty
would have been 11. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Anyhow, myself and my brother were sat in the house one
evening and we heard Kirsty loudly banging on the front door to be let in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was crying hysterically and was trying to
talk but couldn't.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was obviously
very distressed and we thought she had been attacked.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">When she eventually did calm down, which was some time later
that evening, she told me what had happened.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She said she had been walking down <st1:Street><st1:address>Langley Lane</st1:address></st1:Street>
when she looked over at the tree and saw a figure hanging from it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She said the figure was glowing white and had
a bend in its neck, like its neck had been broken.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She then proceeded to run all the way home,
which was a distance of about a quarter of a mile.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She did not want to tell our brother as she
thought he would not believe her (he is a cynic).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Having had experiences myself, I am open
minded and certainly don't feel she made it up.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She has always stood by her story.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I was looking at your haunted places in <st1:place><st1:City>Houston</st1:City>,
 <st1:State>TX</st1:State></st1:place>. (I grew up there)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I came across the <st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Jefferson</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceName>Davis</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType>Hospital</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>
and it reminded me of something.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once
after a good night of hanging out, a group of friends and I decided to go and
check it out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When we got there, I
immediately felt unwanted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My skin
crawled with fear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I kept telling
everyone that we were not welcome there. We were only equipped with several
lighters, so the shadows were unbelievable.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We kept hearing people talk, thinking it was someone else in the
hospital someone would call out, but no one would answer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I kept feeling something touch my back,
thinking it was my boyfriend I'd turned around but he was a couple of feet away
from me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The entire time we were there,
I kept telling them we needed to leave.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After being there for a while my friends got annoyed with me, so we
decided to leave.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As we were leaving the
building, I was holding my boyfriends hand, something shoved me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I fell so heard that I twisted my ankle. It
was swollen for weeks and my doctor couldn't tell me why. Nothing was broken.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It finally healed after 6 months.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I still have problems with my ankle to this
day.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Ghost experience --- White Noise</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: ReSpcNo1Player@aol.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I have an experience that I would like to submit to the web
site.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have it attached below.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">After my encounter one late night in August with my sister,
I found out that we'd always been around ghosts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My family has moved five times and in every
place there'd been at least one ghost there with us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I lived in <st1:State><st1:place>Texas</st1:place></st1:State>
I moved from <st1:City><st1:place>Houston</st1:place></st1:City> to <st1:City><st1:place>San
  Antonio</st1:place></st1:City>, in that move a ghost that we'd had for a year
followed us to our new apartment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
living there for about a year, we discovered a new ghost; this one would hold
the bathroom doors closed and knock over our memorabilia items we had on
display.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The event that completely
changed my view of the paranormal happened in August of 2001.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">It was the early hours of the morning, about <st1:time minute="0" hour="4">4 a.m.</st1:time>, and for some reason I couldn't
sleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My older sister was on her
computer and she'd found a bunch of old music files she had downloaded for her
"History of Rock" class.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then
she came across a Britney Spears parody song, downloaded from a radio station's
web site.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well, the song itself was actually
only a clip about 30-40 seconds long.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
played it, and the file for some reason was corrupt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The words were garbled, playing in a
slow,deep, incomprehensible voice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had
chills listening to it play, and when I looked at the counter it had been
playing for over a minute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My sister
finally turned it off - she was just as spooked as I was.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We moved on, laughing about the look on the
other's face.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then about five minutes
later we heard three soft, solid pounds on the back wall in the far back of the
apartment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither one of us said a
word, we just listened, trying to explain it away in our minds; we lived on the
second floor, and shared only one wall ... and that was not it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Another couple minutes passed by and the
banging jumped to the one long wall we shared.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Still towards the back of the apartment but getting closer, we couldn't
help but stare at each other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After that
one we finally decided to ask the other if she'd "heard that."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of course we heard the same thing and not a
minute later the banging jumped to the room right next to us, on the same
wall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Three solid bangs escalating in
amplitude.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My heart was racing waiting
for the next set, afraid of where it would jump next.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A couple minutes passed, and just as I began
to calm down and blame the banging on the maintenance worker that we shared the
wall with, the banging suddenly jumped forward to the wall behind the
computer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I looked above me to see the
ceiling light shaking.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moments later the
banging shot across the room to the balcony.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It sounded as if the entire wall was pounded on with one giant
fist.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Three echoing pounds later
everything stopped.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I checked the
sliding doors which were locked, thankfully.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We both ran into my mother's room ... she was still sleeping.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She hadn't heard a thing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was something I never understood.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My baby brother was in the same room with her
- door closed - and he heard a soft rumble and my mother heard nothing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">After that experience, I have always been a little on
edge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I always think about what would
have happened if I had left the sliding doors unlocked that night, and what was
the thing trying to get in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One thing I
know for sure is that my ghost from <st1:City><st1:place>Houston</st1:place></st1:City>
left that night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And the one already
there seemed to get more active.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Everyone started to hear their name being called, even when no one else
was around.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Luckily no one ever
attempted to communicate with whatever it was.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As a matter of fact, we rarely began to answer unless we saw the person
who was calling us.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Two years later, after I finished high school, we moved to <st1:State><st1:place>Iowa</st1:place></st1:State>
when I was accepted to college and so far we have not had any strange
occurrences.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">well my story starts off in zacatecas, <st1:country-region><st1:place>mexico</st1:place></st1:country-region>..
i was over there for a summer vacation visiting relatives. one night it was 5
min. before <st1:time minute="0" hour="12">12:00</st1:time> at night and my
cousins and were talking inside her room. it was like 5 of us.suddenly we all
heard the cry of a lady which was very emotional and scary! in the morning i
asked my grandma what is was and she told me it was the weeping lady. Wow i was
freaked out when she told me the leyend of the weeping lady who appears at
rivers trying to find her children she drowned,or so the leyend goes. i
believed her because there is a river that passes in front of my cousins house.
some people have even seen her, that is worse. some people say that when you
hear her cry, if it sounds far away it means that she is close, but if you hear
her very close it means that she is far away.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">8 years ago Myself, my husband and my brother lived at this
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were told by the neighbor that
no one ever lasts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We didn't
either.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not because of the haunting, but
because we needed to come back to MA for family reasons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anyway We lived in this house for 9
months.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were told the AC was broken
and in the valley of Folsom it gets very hot, but not in our living room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was always very very cool in that part of
the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On one occasion I was in the
bathroom and after my shower I was looking in the mirror and I saw an orange
blur over my shoulder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I turned to look,
but it wasn't there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It looked as though
is was a face and it would have been standing at the right height to where a
head would be on a grown person.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After a
few weeks I mentioned it to my brother and husband and my brother relayed a story
about one night while sound asleep he was woken by a very large thud on his
bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He said it felt like a bowling ball
had landed on the bed, like someone sat down.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He said he was too scared to look, so he fell back to sleep!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After a few more months we found out that the
house used to belong to the Town Doctor that treated inmates from the Folsom
Prison back in the 1800's!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After putting
all the info together we realized we were living in a haunted house! </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I was hoping to see other stories about the house on the
website, but maybe my story will start the flow.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Down the Road</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I think this fits into your site.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It happened a long time back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I was eleven my father died from a heart
attack in our house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because of the
trauma on my little sister, she witnessed people trying to rescitate him,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>our mother decided to move.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We ended up moving just a little bit farther
"down the road" into an older house that had been built in the early
seventies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The owner of the house had
also died in the house many years before.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was a two story house and the bottom level was made of cinder
block.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am guessing because of this, it
was the reason that it was always cold down stairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Luck, or unluck would have it that the bottom
level would be mine and my sister's rooms.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It always was creepy feeling downstairs.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It always felt like you were being watched but I chalked it up to an
overactive imagination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Me and my sister
both felt uncomfortable in the downstairs area.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It consisted of our two rooms, a laundry room and a cellar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One morning, when I was fourteen I was
standing in front of my dresser mir r putting on my make-up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Suddenly I heard a voice come up to my right
ear and whisper my name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that
on my right side was a wall really freaked me out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I ran upstairs and asked my mom had she
called for me, she told me that she had not.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I hated sleeping in my room from that time on and always tired to sleep
with the light on even though it drove my mom nuts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My sister had a similar experience.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was staying at a friend's house one night
and my sister went downstairs to make sure the door leading outside was
closed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She said that as she went to place
her foot on the bottom step she said something came up to her and whispered MY
name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She said that she has also
experienced things being thrown in the dark when there was no one to throw
them, such as a sock.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My mom lives there
by herself now and as far as I know she has never had anything odd happen to
her, but whenever I visit she knows that I will not sleep in the<span style="">&nbsp; </span>lower bedrooms.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I still feel odd in the lower level but not
as bad as I use to.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If anyone has any
thoughts or suggestions on this I would love to hear it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Feel free to email me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thanks and you have an awesome site!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&#8220;The same thing followed me around until I finally left your
father,&#8221; my mom told me after I finally told her about strange experiences I
had been having.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Since I was 13 something had been terrorizing me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Negative energy had latched onto me at some
point and followed me for years wherever I went.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is said that at that age, as a female,
your emotions are so unstable you become very vulnerable to the negative
entities that sadly roam the earth in search of company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This entity was particularly depressed and
angry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was smothering and possessive
and sometimes lashed out at me for no apparent reason. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">It started one night when I awoke to breathing in my
ear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was hard and heavy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Like emphysema patients sound when not on a
breathing apparatus.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Naturally I was
startled and tried to get up to run.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But
I couldn&#8217;t move.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was paralyzed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No matter how hard I tried I could not move a
single muscle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I panicked and tried to
scream for my mom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The paralysis
apparently affected my whole body.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
couldn&#8217;t even open my mouth to scream.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>By now the breathing had stopped but I still couldn&#8217;t move.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally after what seemed like hours of
malfunctioning, I jolted upright in bed, gulping in air.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was when I realized that I hadn&#8217;t even
been breathing during that episode.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
was determined to stay up the rest of the night until daylight, but sleep took
over and eventually I was knocked out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
awoke again to the same scenario. This time I fought back even harder and it
lasted only less than a second.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">When I told my dad about this, he had assured me it was a
night terror but suggested that I sprinkle holy water in the corners of my room
and carry a cross. I later found out that he had only said that to avoid
scaring me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He actually believed I was
being followed by a supernatural force. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">From then on, although I had not experienced an attack since
that first time I continued to see a shadow of a very, very tall wide width man
in my closet.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I had a rough child hood from 13 until I moved out at
17.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I endured a lot of emotional and
verbal abuse by my father and hadn&#8217;t spoken much to my mother in years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I felt very abandoned by both of my parents.
I was rebelling to the extreme.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was at
an all time low in my life when I met my boyfriend Maurice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He gave me a reason to be happy again and I
fell in love.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I moved in with him when I
was 17 to get as far away from the abuse as possible. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The attacks started again. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I still saw this shadow figure standing in my closet at
night in our new apartment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I refused to
sleep alone so I became very dependant on Maurice&#8217;s company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Maurice, being a skeptic, thought I was just
&#8220;seeing things.&#8221; </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">One night, as I sleepily crawled out of bed to go to the
bathroom, I opened my eyes only to see blackness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pure blackness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I panicked, thinking I had gone blind, when I
realized this blackness was swirling. I looked way up and saw that the shadow
was standing right in front of me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
screamed and jumped back onto the bed on top of my sleeping boyfriend.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was crying, covering my eyes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He panicked as well and was doing his best to
console me without knowing what was wrong.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I tried to explain it to him over my sobbing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He became angry and yelled into the air for
the shadow to leave me alone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then he
turned on the light for me so I could complete my earlier mission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I didn&#8217;t see the shadow for the rest of the
night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">On another occasion I had made the mistake of sleeping
alone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My boyfriend was playing video
games with a friend.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I awoke I
noticed the room was lighted red.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
tried to turn on the light but it didn&#8217;t work.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I suddenly felt an overwhelming impending doom that scared me so badly I
proceeded to run from the room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That&#8217;s
when I suddenly awoke again! &#8220;Ok, so it was only a dream,&#8221; I thought, &#8220;Thank
God.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But again I noticed the room
lighted red as in the dream.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This time I
ran with out attempting to turn on the light.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I got to my boyfriend and lay down sleep on the couch.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I awoke later back in my room in the exact
same scenario! Finally I started to cry and I ran to my boyfriend asking him to
hold me until I fell asleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I awoke
again, this time for real.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was back in
my room and noticed that the room was dark now as I had remembered it when I
fell asleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Still scared, I slept on
the couch in the living room with my boyfriend until he came to bed with
me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">We moved into another apartment a few months later, in a
nicer neighborhood.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was here that the
attacks became more frequent and more menacing.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I had visions of terrible domestic violence in that apartment that I
believe left a lot of negative energy in that place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Coupled with the worsening violence between
me and my boyfriend and the deeper depression I fell into, it made for a very
unhappy home. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Strange things occurred to me almost every night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I still saw the shadow in my closet at
night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I would see things move in the
corner of my eye.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I felt some one
watching all the time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once, the water
faucet turned on by itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was always
losing things.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I would hear footsteps
coming towards me when I would go to sleep alone only for them to stop when I
turned to see who it was and saw no one there. I became very afraid of looking
into mirrors at night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I started
sleeping with lights on and the TV blaring to block out the sounds and to avoid
seeing things in the dark.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Eventually I
stopped sleeping in my bed altogether when Maurice started working grave
shift.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My boyfriend complained of a
corner of our bedroom that &#8220;creeped him out&#8221; and he refused to go near it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He would not place furniture in that
corner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">One day, in the throws of depression following a severe
fight with my boyfriend, I decided I couldn&#8217;t take life anymore.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My boyfriend had left for hours and I had no
clue when he was coming back. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>I felt the
presence of the shadow suffocating me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
opened a bottle of Excedrin Migraine with Sleep Aid and downed the entire
bottle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Fortunately for me, I had taken
in too much of the poison and my body rejected it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I began vomiting profusely until I was dry
heaving so badly I couldn&#8217;t breath.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
crawled out of the bathroom in immense pain.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I began to feel the effects of what medicine did make it into my blood
stream.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The entire time I felt the
shadow&#8217;s presence so strongly, it literally suffocated me until I was gasping
for air again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Soon I was so high on the
sleep aid I passed out on the floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
vaguely remember my boyfriend picking me up and placing me in our bed and
falling asleep with his arms around me.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I slept for 16 hours.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Not too long after that, my boyfriend and I had planned a
&#8220;movie night&#8221; together.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As I walked into
the bedroom to join him I suddenly noticed a look of terror on his face.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I ran to him to see if he was ok.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He just grabbed me and kissed me and said it
was nothing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I badgered him to tell me
what was wrong.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally he says, &#8220;I saw
your shadow, it was hovering behind you while you were coming into the
room.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A chill went up my spine and I asked
him to describe it to me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He said it was
a black cloudy mist that hovered over my head about a foot behind me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the blackness he noticed that there were
two holes that looked as though they were its eyes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was so taken back by what he was seeing
that he blinked hard to make sure it was real which is when it disappeared. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>He said, &#8220;I thought you were just exaggerating
about this.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That you were just seeing
things.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But now I know.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I&#8217;m sorry I didn&#8217;t take you more seriously.&#8221; </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">After our year lease was up I wanted to get as far away from
that apartment as possible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The last day
in that apartment we took my mom&#8217;s suggestion and saged the apartment and
ourselves, prayed for the shadow to leave and abandoned the apartment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I haven&#8217;t seen the shadow since nor have I
suffered anymore attacks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have since
improved my life drastically with the change in my outlook on life to help
guide me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My mom believes that the
shadow may have been an extension of my dad attempting to watch over me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It makes perfect sense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It attacked me the most when my dad and I
started drifting further apart from each other.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the midst of depression, my dad succeeded in taking his life a couple
of months after I had gotten rid of the shadow.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Although I miss him with all of my heart and soul, I have not felt that
negative energy around me since his passing.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This, to me, confirms my mother&#8217;s belief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Despite this, I still sometimes fear the
return of the worst thing to haunt me in my life, the shadow. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">This is a weird story.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It still sends chills through me as I think and type.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One summer Friday night, my boyfriend and I
were driving to <st1:City><st1:place>Nashville</st1:place></st1:City>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was stationed in the Air Force at <st1:place><st1:PlaceType>Fort</st1:PlaceType>
 <st1:PlaceName>Campbell</st1:PlaceName></st1:place> and the closest
metropolitan area was the 45 minute commute to <st1:City><st1:place>Nashville</st1:place></st1:City>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anyway, as we were headed to the city, we
noticed an old looking rusty faded red pick-up truck pulled off to the side of
the road.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was loaded with what seemed
to be OLD furniture... almost antiquish, as if someone were moving.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because I was driving, I decided to pull
over.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Paul, my boyfriend, was all of a
sudden very pale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I asked him what was
wrong but he wouldn't answer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He just
sat staring forward in the passenger's seat.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I drove a station wagon and had plenty of room in the back seats.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I got out of the car and walked over to the
truck.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was a woman and three
children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The woman, dressed in a plain
floral print cotten dress, who I assumed to be the mother, was barefoot along
with all three children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She had an
older son who looked to be aybe 8 or 9, a daughter who was maybe 4 or 5 and
then a toddler boy that she held in her arms.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They all were dirty and seemed very "poor" and
malnutritioned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their clothes were of an
odd nature as well. Very "Little House on the Prairie" like, if you
know what I mean.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well, I asked if I
could help.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The woman looked extremely
scared and I asked if maybe the husband had gone ahead for help.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She said no and that her truck had run out of
gas.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By this time, Paul had regained
some of his color back and walked up behind me.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He offered her and her children a ride to the nearest gas station.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was very happy that he was willing to
help.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They all clamored into the back of
my little car and off we went, only this time Paul was driving.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He continuously would stare at this woman via
the rear view mirror.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He would drill her
with all sorts of personal questions but the woman remained silent... strangely
enough, so did the children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What also
was strange was the smell.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They reeked
of decay... as if they hadn't had baths in months!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anyway, I would smile at the children trying
to make them smile...<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They did...<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was completely fine with it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>About three or four miles down the road there
was an exit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We took it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We pulled into the nearest gas station.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I immediately offered money to the woman who
graciously (at least in my mind) took it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Paul was insistent that we leave, but I didn't want to leave them there
without help.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The woman said thank you
and basically turned away from us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
took it as my que to leave.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once Paul
and I got back into the car, he immediately insisted that we return to the
woman's truck.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I told him it was
pointless with the woman being left at the station.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He told me that I didn't understand, and that
he needed to check something out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With
my Friday night practically gone (but feeling good about performing a good
deed) I decided what the heck. bsp; We headed back toward home and the truck
which was supposed to be in route.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Well... one mile... two miles...<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>four miles...<span style="">&nbsp; </span>five miles...<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was a little confused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally another exit. Paul finally
breathed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I looked at him
questioningly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally, he told me that
he expected the truck to be gone... and his reason for it was that he had
picked-up that same woman with the same three children about four years ago and
that the children nor the woman had aged.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They also wore the same exact clothes.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He was convinced that we had just dropped off a family of ghosts at the
gas station...<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No wonder he was anxious
to leave!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Wondering if anyone else has
witnessed this woman and her children on I-24 going East towards <st1:City><st1:place>Nashville</st1:place></st1:City>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Can't remember the exact exit though.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This happened over 8 years ago.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thanks for reading</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Me and a few freinds lived at an old run down tavern in <st1:place><st1:City>Watertown</st1:City>
 <st1:State>WI</st1:State></st1:place> and we had many weird experiences. There
were many times we would all leave and as we were leaving all the lights in the
house would come on and shut back off, other times there would be one person
left in the house on the way out and it would sound like someone was chasing
you down the stairs, and afew times while everyone was asleep I would be up
smoking my last cigarette of the day w/ my girlfriend and we would see a figure
walking around outside or in the same room we were in and what really creeped me
out was last year a few of us went to the old tavern to check it out becuase it
has been condemed since then (2003) and I walked inside and it was about 65
degrees when the temp outside was around 85 a few people have reported seeing
figures jumping out of trees when they were standing next to it<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the building has been standing for at least
85 years and used to be a tavern/house many families have lived in it over the
years it is owned by my freinds father who ownes a car dealership acrossed the
street we lived there for a year rent free the last name of the tavern was Aces
and Eights all the windows are broken out and it is condemed and there is talk
that the local fire department wants to use it for training</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">For the first seven years of my life my family lived <st1:State><st1:place>Tennessee</st1:place></st1:State>.
We had a 100 year old house with a tin roof that leaked every time it rained.
Some parents may not allow their toddlers to watch horror movies but my parents
didn't really care to keep those kind of movies from my sister and me. So, as a
child, about 4 years old, I already believed in ghosts and supernatural things.
</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I still don't know if it was just my imagination or if
something was really walking up and down the long hallway right outside of the
bedroom that my sister and I shared. Each it would take me at least a half hour
to get to sleep because I always heard a constant treading out there in the
hallway. Naturally, I was completely freaked out and never dared leave my bed.
But one night, I had to use the bathroom. There was a small bathroom right in
my bedroom but I didn't want to use it because it was quite small and I would
have felt better if I was in a larger bathroom with more light to shine on me-
well the bathroom that my parents claimed fit that description nicely. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I ventured out of my bed, turned no lights on for I didn't
want to wake my little sister, and crept out into the hall. My parents'
bathroom was no more than five or six feet away when you left my bedroom. It
seemed as though it took me a whole 5 mintues to get there. My heart was
pounding and the thought that there was something behind would not leave my
mind. And of course, just like in the movies, I felt that presence behind me...
and I turned to look. Behind me stood a small black figure with illuminated,
laser-lemon eyes. It stood there and glared at me, like I had interrupted it.
At the time it looked as though it had been wiping it's hands on the curtain
that my dad had hung over a small closet that he never had the time or will to
put a door on. I was 4 years old so when anyone looked at me like I had done
something wrong, I got scared and upset. Now this was a demon-like looking kind
of thing. It looked like something out of a cartoon. It had a set of little
horns and everything. So when this monster or whatever it was glared at me like
I had upset it, you know I was freaked out! I started crying and woke my mother
up. As I stood there, I had wet myself. I had been potty-trained but this was
something I just could not hold back. I had had to use the bathroom in the
first place, anyways. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I don't know what that thing was and I have never seen it
since, but I will never forget that night. It is the most vivid memory I have.
And I love horror movies today but I am still afraid of what I might see when
I'm by myself, in the dark. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The House that knew Me</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: kswain@dualprinting.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I used to live in a very old 4 floor house in <st1:place><st1:City>Buffalo</st1:City>,
 <st1:State>New York</st1:State></st1:place>. It was old enough to once have an
orchard behind it and in <st1:City><st1:place>Buffalo</st1:place></st1:City>,
that&#8217;s very rare. Growing up I knew that there was something there watching me.
I would ask the house questions and have it answer me by flashing the light in
my room. I played games with whatever was there but I knew it wasn&#8217;t friendly.
It gave a bad feeling. It would mess with my head. I was an infant in that
house so it knew me very well. It would get me in trouble with my parents. It
once hid my allowance when I was five or six and I blamed my older brother. I
told my parents he stole the missing money. I looked everywhere for it and then
my parents looked under my bin of toys and there was the money. I had already
looked in that spot. So I was blamed for trying to get my brother in trouble.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">A black shadowy figure of a man has chased me out of my
basement, I&#8217;ve seen a cat&#8217;s shadow walking across the top bunk of my bunk beds
as I lay on the bottom (my cat was on my kitchen table when I ran out of the
room), I&#8217;ve seen a person laying on the top bunk and rolling around (the
imprint of a body at least) when nobody was there, my radio would turn off by
itself, my mother had been shoved in the back very hard by the ghost while
doing laundry in the basement. It wasn&#8217;t a nice presence. It seemed to enjoy
taunting us. It never was too aggressive though.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">It got a lot more aggressive when my family moved out. We
moved to the country but did not sell the house. I was going to college at the
time and working in <st1:City><st1:place>Buffalo</st1:place></st1:City> so my
parents thought it would be a good idea if I moved back into the house by
myself. I took the upstairs apartment just below the attic because it was the
cleanest after the move. There was only a couch in the place the first night I
stayed there. I curled up on the couch at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="0">12am</st1:time>
to go to sleep. I was starting to drift off when I heard extremely loud banging
on the wall in between the master bedroom and the living room. It was like
someone was kicking the wall with all their might. I knew immediately what it
was. I knew the ghost was angry because we left. I got up and walked to my radio,
which was right against the wall in question, and turned it on. I tried to get
back to sleep but every time I closed my eyes it would turn the radio up full
blast.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">It banged and messed with me the whole night but I
eventually fell asleep.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Other things have happened to me there but not related to
this particular ghost. My first love had never really known he was my first
love. He was sent to live with his uncle in <st1:State><st1:place>California</st1:place></st1:State>
after we had just started the everyday hour long phone conversations part of
the teenage love epic. He called me from <st1:State><st1:place>Calif.</st1:place></st1:State>
one day and told me he&#8217;d be gone for a long time. We lost touch and a year or
two went by. I then saw him again at a friend&#8217;s house and hugged him pretty
hard to say the least. He looked sad and withdrawn. I decided to tell him how
much I loved him and that I wanted to start again. I gave myself a time limit,
two weeks. Well, one week went by and on my may way to school in my mothers van
I heard on the news, 16 year old boy has committed suicide. He was hit by an Amtrack
train. They didn&#8217;t say his name but I knew that it was him. I looked at my Mom
and told her that I was sure it was Corey. She knew it too. She asked if I
wanted to stay home from school and I told her no. When I got home I was
greeted at the door by a friend, my suspicions were confirmed. I took it very
hard.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Two days after the funeral I was walking home with a friend.
We took a shortcut through an alleyway right by train tracks. An Amtrack went
by and I just fell to the ground and started yelling his name as loud as I
could. All of a sudden I felt him. My friend stopped trying to console me and
said she knew he was there. We finally got back to my house and sat in my
brother&#8217;s bedroom (he was out for the night). We were sitting on the bed
talking when I happened to glance across the room to a once empty chair. There
he was, legs crossed and hands under his chin staring at me. I didn&#8217;t say
anything to my friend; I thought she wouldn&#8217;t see him. Then I noticed her
staring at the same spot. &#8220;That&#8217;s him&#8221; she said. She described exactly what I
was seeing. I knew then that he had come back so that I could finally say what
I needed to say. I told him I loved him more than I will ever love anyone. He
stayed there for an hour or two and didn&#8217;t move. I eventually went to bed and
dreamed of him. I talked to my friend while I was sleeping that night. I told
her I was dead and couldn&#8217;t move but I don&#8217;t remember talking at all. He&#8217;s
visited me since, holding my hand and I swear I&#8217;ve felt him pass right through
me. I&#8217;m married now but I was right, I&#8217;ll never love anyone as much as I loved
him. He&#8217;s with me always now. All I have to do is call him and he&#8217;s right
there.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I have one more story that happened while I was in that
house. This one is the most mysterious to me. When I was about 4 years old I
had a horrible and very realistic nightmare. I was speeding through a maze of
stone walls and dead vines on my bed. I watched the walls whiz by as lay in
bed, eventually I got up on my knees and held onto the head board. I could feel
the cold wind hitting my face. All of the sudden my bed stopped and when I
looked around I was surrounded by four stone walls. I blinked and they
disappeared and I was in my room again. I lay back down in my bed and tried to
fall asleep. Just as I closed my eyes I heard a creak. I looked over to my
closet door and it began to open, not moving the giant pile of toys in front of
it. I screamed for my mother and she yelled back from the next room that my
brother just had a horrible nightmare and that she&#8217;d be there in a minute. I
saw a bright light coming from inside the closet as it opened but the light
didn&#8217;t hurt my eyes. Then a beautiful blonde haired woman with blue eyes
floated into the room. There was light all around her and flowing white garments.
She coasted along the floor toward me. I pulled my blanket over my head and
within seconds it was pulled off of me with invisible hands. She stood over me
while I was sobbing for my mother and stared for a moment. Then she asked &#8220;Why
are you crying?&#8221; in the sweetest voice I&#8217;d ever heard. My mom walked in and she
disappeared and the closet door was closed as if it had never been open. To
this day I do not know what she wanted. She may have been my angel, but I don&#8217;t
know why she came. I&#8217;m no psychic, I&#8217;m no especially gifted person but ever
since I left that house Corey is the only one I keep in touch with except for a
door slamming, radio turning on or misplaced article here or there.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The Brown Man</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Hi, I am 40 years old and this story is very true.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When my brother, sister and I were young,
about 7, 8, 9, maybe even younger, we used to see what we used to call the
Brown Man.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was brown from head to
toe. We came to the conclusion he was a black man because his hat, his face,
his clothes and his shoes were all brown, different shades, but all brown.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We would see him periodically, and take off
running when we did, but our parent never seen him. We'd walk from the kitchen
and turn the corner and he'd just be standing there. Sometimes we'd hear the
toilet set drop.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Just little
things.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After we grew up, my sister was
about 25 when she had her first child. She had a girl.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My sisters daughter used to what we thought
talk to herself when she was about 2 or 3 years old and my sister decided it
was time to ask her who she was talking to...and her daughter told her, Mr.
Burgess.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So this went on for
sometime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She would play, have tea
parties and sing with him just about everytime she was in my parents home. Well
one day my niece asked my sister why Mr. Burgess wore brown all the
time.....needless to say, that really shook us up, because we thought we saw a
brown man...we would tease each other and say "the brown man's behind you
and get a real kick out of it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I've
since had 3 children and my sister another daughter, but they have never come
in contact or have ever seen the brown man.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I just want to start by saying i love your site....I've been
coming here for about 4 years now,and decided to share my story....I will make
it as short as possible.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When I was married
to my first husband we rented this house in central texas where we are from.The
year was 1992 and we have a daughter who at the time was 6 months old...We had
been living in this house for about 4 months and nothing out of the ordinary
had ever happened until this one night...it was in December and me and my
husband was watching a movie(not scary).Well my husband ran a wrecker service
and got a call about midnight that night....So he left and i was still watching
the movie.My daughter was in her crib asleep...About 15 minutes after he
left,the back door started to shake violently...I thought someone was<span style="">&nbsp; </span>trying to break in so i called 911...I looked
out the window and nobody was outside....The police showed up and checked
everything out,but couldn't find nothing...My husband had a police scanner in
his truck and rushed home....Everything was fine until we went to bed...We
started to hear footsteps in our daughters room...Everytime we went to go check
they would stop...We did this about 7 times...The last time we were sitting on
the bed trying to figure out what was going on when we both happened to look
down the hallway and we both saw this black smokey figure walk down...We both
looked at each other shocked and scared to death...We left that night to my
parents house and moved out the next day....Anyhow,that is my true story...Any
questions, feel free to e-mail me...</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">It was when I was younger I believe I was twelve or thirteen
years old I was up at the cottage with my family,it has been in my family for
years and we often spend two weeks in July up there.In the living room there is
a round table where we often play card games,well one night my mother,some
cousins,my older brother,and I decided to play a few hands of crazy eights
there is three small windows where the table is and my mother and I were facing
so we could see out the windows and my cousins and brother were facing with their
backs against the windows something caught my eye it was a girl coming down the
hill I instantly thought it was my best friend Nikki coming for a visit or for
a late night swim down at the lake because to me it looked like she had a towel
on top of her head,well as the girl got closer to the window I noticed it
wasn't a towel she was wearing it was a veil and what looked like a dirty and
shabby wedding dress.it was then she lifted the veil and much to my surprise I
seen a bone face smiling at me I couldn't believe my eyes I let out a scream
then I watched as she lowered the veil and walked away toward the shed it was
like I was dreaming, I felt like I was crazy, was my mind playing tricks on
me?It wasn't until years later maybe when I was sixteen that my mother told me
she seen it too.but as everyone is skeptical too the thought that there is
actually ghosts and from being told when your younger that there is no such
thing this the time I knew different because my mother and I witnessed it with
our own two eyes.my grandfather passed away at the cottage when I was nine it
was the one place he loved and when he knew he was sick he wouldn't have wanted
a better place than there too spend his last days.there has been a lot of
unexplainable things that have occurred there not just with us but by other
family members,my older cousins have been there and when they awoke have found
a fresh pot of brewed coffee and my grandfathers favorite mug beside it.when my
cousin was younger about fifthteen he had got hit by a street car well the
doctors didn't think he would live at one point they pronounced him as
dead,every bone in his body was pratically broken he was in a full body cast I
remember going to visit him in the hospital I was four years old and it's one
of my most vivid memories, well thank the lord he lived. after that it was
something he didn't like to talk about and it was quite understandable.a few
years ago we both happened to be up at the cottage at the same time I was
outside having a smoke and chatting with him I was telling him about Sylvia
Browne the well known psychic it was then we started talking about his accident
and how he went thorough the tunnels and into a pasture he then told me he knew
who said it wasn't his time and to go back, it was his hockey coaches wife who
passed away.when he told me this a feeling of happiness passed threw me because
I knew there was something more for us after life and it wasn't reading it from
a book it was from a family member who actually experienced it.I believe loved
ones who we've lost send messages to us all the time we just have to be able to
take notice it's a sign not just a strange coincidence, but it's all up to you
if you want to believe it or not it's how far you want your mind to explore </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">My First Experience</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: valerie_norton2003@yahoo.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">my name is Val. On Wednesday, I was at my Grandma's house,
it was about <st1:time minute="0" hour="0">12:00 a.m.</st1:time> and I saw a
young woman, she tall, as tall as the door frame she was standing in front
of.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She had blond hair, and was about 20
or 25 years old, she was wearing red pants and a red shirt, and she was looking
at family pictures that are lined along the bedroom hallway.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I hid under my blanket I was so scared, but
then I look again she was still there. I was so scared that I went back under
my blanket and finally fell back to sleep. Then I woke up at <st1:time minute="0" hour="14">2:00</st1:time> and she was there. I hid again and went
back to sleep. Then at <st1:time minute="0" hour="16">4:00</st1:time> I saw her
again, I watched closely, but I noticed she was looking at me. She started to
walk toward me, but as she got closer she was getting smaller and younger.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She stopped half way to the bedroom and
looked at another picture.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She now
looked to be 7 or 8 years old. I did the s e thing and hid under my blanket
again and went back to sleep,<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>About
1hour later I was feeling something like a presence in the room, so I look and
she was there but she was fading away. Then Saturday night I saw a man. I did
get a go look because once i look away he was gone.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>AND I DON'T KNOW THEM!!!</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">This one was about a week before this one but on a Thursday
night I saw a old man. I didn't think of who it was and why he was there. This
was the first time I have seen ghost.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The<span style="">&nbsp; </span>next day I call my mother and
she said that my grandpa died Thursday night. I didn't know what to say. I saw
him again on Saturday night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then I
called my mother<span style="">&nbsp; </span>day to see how she
doing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She then told me that my great
grandmother have died also.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I think it
was my grandpa coming to say goodbye to me.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">My Experiences</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: rebeccafalzarano2@yahoo.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My first experience with supernatural type things happened
at my ex inlaws home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am one of those
type people I have to see it to believe it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>People just telling me about it.. well.. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">So anyway, my sister in laws one day, starting telling me
about some things that had been happening in the house. They had lived there
just short of a year and didnt notice anything till after our nephew was
born.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When he was a few months old, his
mom noticed that when she was changing him he started to stare at something
above him and would smile.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She would
look thinking it was a fly or something, anything, but nothing was there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This continued off and on for awhile.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The next insident to happen was that a boom
box in the bathroom started to play Winnie the Pooh stories.. When looked at,
there was no tape or anything in it, no batteries and it wasnt plugged in.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Around this time the touch lamp that wa sin
the living room started to turn on and off.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My mother in law didnt believe any of these things when she was told
about it and when it happend to her one time, the washer was running so she
said it was from the vibration of the washer.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>However, about 2 years after moving into the house and being told about
all thehappenings,she finnaly got her dose of it.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>They had an old TV set and the nob for
changing the channel was hard to move.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She was in the room by herself and watching TV when allof a sudden the
nob started moving and chaninging channels on her as easy as could be.. nobody
else was i the room or near the TV.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">About a year later my mother in law and father in law
seperated and he stayed in the house with his two youngest daughters. He was a
truck driver so asked me and my ex husband to move in to help watch out for
them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well as I said, I had been told
all about everything going on in the house, but didnt believe it...well one day
it was just my father in law, my youngest son who was 2 and I in the
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My husband was at work<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(30 minutes away) and the girls were at
school.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My father in law asked if I
would please make him some coffee ( he had just gotten home from a run in the
truck) as he was going to take a shower.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I made him the coffee and set the cup on the table.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I went and sat in the front room, ( I could
see everything in the kitchen from here and my son was asleep) and read. I
could hear the shower running. When my father in law finsihed he came out and
asked where his coffe was, I said right on the table.. he siad no it
wasnt...<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My head had been down while I
was reading , but I would of noticed if anyone had come into the kitchen... the
coffee cup had been moved to the counter.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I also started to see the touch lamp going on and off after this.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later when researched by my sister in laws,
they found that the house was built next to a cemetery and a little boy had
been killed in that area close to the house.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>( This wa sin Giltner, Nebraska)</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The second incident of unusual activity occured in<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Columbus Nebraska where we was living.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">It wasnt major things but just a few things and it wasnt all
the time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We sleep with a fan on at
night. We always have it on low.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Well
one night my husband did the usual, trn on the fan and such and climbed into
bed. I know for a fact he turned it on as I watched him do it. Later I woke up and
it wasnt running. Well I fiigured it had shorted out. When I got up to look at
it, it was in the off postion.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I turned
it back on and it was fine.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Another
night, same thing except this time I we both woke up and it was running on
high.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am a light sleeper and can feel
anytime my husband gets in or out of bed. We also was the only two people in
the house.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Another thing was lights being on, when we knew we had shut
them off, and also for about a week, whenever we went to bed after my husband
was asleep I would here banging/clunking sounds. When I would quietly wake him
up to go check it out, it would stop.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When he would be back in bed and asleep it would start again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And again I would wake him up and it would stop.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After a week of this we started staying up
past the time it usually happened.. nothing happened...Then we went to bed and
it would start again...only to immediately stop when I woke my husband... again
quietly so if anyone was doing it, they wouldnt hear me wake him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He never turned on the lights when he went to
check it out either.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After two weeks I
started leaving a light on in the living room and it stopped happening.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I started turning the light back off again
after two months.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Didnt hear it again.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">A few months later ( last summer) we had a room mate that
was outside when we came home and when asked why they was outside, stated that
they came out after two wine glasses flew off our computer desk. He said they
didnt just fall of, they fl off.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>(
Note* This one we are not sure of as the person wasnt the most reliable person,
but we took it into consideration considering our own expereinces).<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We did notice that nothing unusal happened
whenever we had other people in the home ( Living, staying over or just
visiting).</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">My Experience</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: anonymous</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Dear the Shadowlands,</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I haven't let out my experience to no one but your company
and my best friends. This is how it all went:</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My Grandma died in 1997. It was a big shock to me and it was
very upsetting. From then until the beginning of 2005, I hadn't seen mirages or
any real life things. Then, in March, something happened.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I was tossing and turning in my bed and I felt really
uncomfortable. I finally decided that I'd go downstairs and get a glass of
water. Then as I walked back up the stairs, I felt a presence in my house - it
was as though I<span style="">&nbsp; </span>was being watched. I
dashed up the stairs in fright, put the glass on my bedside cabinet and leaped
into bed. Back erect, I rubbed my eyes. Then I saw her. She was glowing and
looked strange. She emerged from my T.V, passed through the radiator and moved
round to my bed to face me. She just stared at me, and then she faded away. You
couldn't exactly see much facial expression - her eyes and nose weren't there.
I was pretty freaked out, and I didn't sleep that night - I couldn't...</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The same happened again and again. Then on the fourth time,
she held out a small black ring box. I was curious. I reached out and touched
the ghostly box. Then she faded away yet again. I woke up the next morning
feeling strange. I pulled my arm out from under my pillow and there was the
black box. Then I remembered that I had put it in the attic along with all the
photos of her, so this was unusual. I opened the box and I saw a charity bagde
she gave me only three weeks before she died. It was touching to see it again.
As I made my bed, there was a photo of herlieing on my sheets. This was getting
weirder by the minute. I couldn't understand it all. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">On the fifth and final time, I spoke to her. My words were;</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">'Look. I don't mean this in a horrid way but I think it's
best if you go away and never come back. I love you, but your really disturbing
me, and I don't like it. I will see you again in some years to come.' By this
minute, I was weeping. Then she faded away and I haven't seen her since...</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">hi the stories that i am about to tell you i will keep breif
as possible the first one is of my grandfather 3 months after he passed away in
1983</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">When i was eight my grandfather passed away due to kidney
failure he lived in Tenneessee at the time, and my family and I lived in
Arkansas.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was never close to my
grandpa because i never got to see him that much and when i did visit him, i
was attached at the hip with him and we seemed to have a bond with one
another.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When he passed away i was very
distraught and missed him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Three months
later i was asleep in the top bunk and shared a room with my sister and i
suddenly woke up and looked at the rocking chair in the corner of my room it was
a full moon and the moon was shining through the blinds and i saw my
grandfather sitting in the rocking chair looking up at me smiling as if he was
saying goodbye to me and he would keep me safe.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I pulled the covers over my head and a few minutes later i looked out of
the covers he was gone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had on the
same clothes that he was buried in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
never told anyone about it till i was 18 in fear they wouldn't believe me and
my mom told me that they usually only visit their kids, but i told her i was
his grandkid i was part of her and i looked alot like my mom when she was
small.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The next time i saw anything i was living in waxhaw, nc and
at the time i was having bad feelings all day i was visiting my sister in
pageland,sc and i decided to call my parents to come get me and they did and
when i got in the car my bad feeling got worse and my mom proceeded to tell me
that a friend of mine and my brothers that lived in Arkansas was stabbed and i
began to cry and had a sense of horror come over me and she said that they were
going to sew him up and send him home, but i knew better i dreamt his death a
month to the day before he was murdered it was bits and pieces.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later on that evening when we got home i
stayed up for a bit and decided to go to bed and try to rest and i turned off
the lights and turned over towards the wall.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I had a feeling that i was being watched and i turned over and saw in
the corner towards the door a figure that was black and was 6'1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was scared out of my mind and decided that
i would cover my head and he didn't go away.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I knew it was my friend Chris i could see all the detail outline of his
body down to his curly hair.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I stayed
awake all night until the sun come up paralyzed with fear in my bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>as the sun come up he went away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I never got to tell him goodbye, but he was
telling me goodbye and he was killed april 1, 1990 and was kept on life support
till the next day, he had a number of heart sugeries because he was stabbed in
the heart and flatlined on every sugery<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(that is what i was told)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>but i
know he would never do me harm, but i was still freakedout.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Death Dreams and weird things</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">September of 2003 I had a dream that of people i never met
at somekind of gathering and everyone was dressed up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well i dismissed it and 6 months later i
found out why and i will tell u the story behind the dream.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My finance' was killed the morning of January
11, 2004 and i was going to pick him up from his moms after i got off work and
i talked to him around 9pm and he told me to call him back in 15 minutes and
well i got a bad feeling and i called back and didn't get anyone on the
phone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So after work i got our 3
children and went to his moms and to my surprise cops were everywhere and i
took the kids in and i stood in 40 degree weather on her porch to find out if
it was him that was dead or the one who ran and well it was him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So when the body was released to the funeral
home i fixed his hair for the funeral and that was to have my last goodbyes to
him.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">That night at the wake i saw the samething i saw in my dream
people that i never met and went up to his ex boss that i never met and said
hello tj and he was puzzled and i told him who i was and everything was exact
and when i dream things and they eventually come true i get light headed and i
feel like i am going to pass out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I see
things when in reality in a grey smoke like around what i am seeing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was very bizarre and 6 months after his
death i dreamt of people i never met and had conversations with and month after
month at work i saw these people.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have
a gift of foresight<span style="">&nbsp; </span>in my dreams.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I know you make think i am full of s--- but
it's true.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This man was very insistant
of reading my palm and i thought he was just trying to flirt and well i am a
skeptic of palm reading.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Keep in mind i
never seen or met this man before (he kind of looked like bubba on sandford and
son)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>well he took my hand palm up closed
his eyes and began to tell me my life from the time i was 14. he said he saw 2
deaths of one i was very close to and one i never knew.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well the one i knew was my friend chris and
the one i didn't know was the child i had a miscarriage with at 14.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>said he saw 3<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>people that i was close die.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>yes
my brother, grandpa and fiance'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>he said
that i was looking at a suburban and minivan and that he saw me driving one or
the other by febuary 2005.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>at that time
i was looking at both vehicles.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>through
all this i never confirmed anything and he had his eyes closed the whole time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I never said a word.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After he was done he sat down to eat and i
went to him and asked him if he was in a hurry and i talked to him and still
never confirmed anything and he kept looking over my shoulder and i kept
looking behind me and i started looking behind me and i was what r u looking
at?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>he said u have 3 men behind u and he
described my grandpa, my brother, and my finance' to a T and i was in tears he
said they were looking out for me and that my finance' was sad because he

<p class="MsoNormal">Honor Farm</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: obcessivepink@hotmail.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">In Pueblo, Colorado, there is a place called, "Honor
Farm." located in a fenced off field just before the nature center. Honor
Farm has a rich history of supposed experiences with the unknown. A brief
explanation of the grounds, rumor says that prior to it vacancy, (if you can
call it that,) Honor Farm was a part of the Colorado Department of Corrections
and was exactly that...an honor farm. Pre-parolees lived here. After the
destruction of the farm itself, it is said that many a many time Satanic cults
held gatherings at Honor Farm. Anyhow, my story is a simple addition to the
vast mystery of Honor Farm. On July 22, 2005, my friend got the bright idea to
go back to Honor Farm at around midnight. It was a full moon that night and it
was just her, another friend and myself. We had been out there a few times,
mostly with friends or during the day. July 21 was the first night we actually
went by ourselves, just the two of us....That night, I kept wanting to walk
farther, closer to the big wall that is the trademark activity are for Honor
Farm. The feelings are almost indescribable. It feels as though thousands of
needles are poking at yourfrozen body, mostly your hands and legs. You can feel
solid emotion all around you, like quicksand slowly pulling your head beneath
it's surface....Needless to say, my friend grabbed my by the arm and pulled me
back to the car, where our other scared friend was waiting with the doors
locked. We got in the car, and that was the end of that experience. Sadly, that
was the beginning of a new found obcession for me...Honor Farm has a
gravitational pull of it's own. Once you go there, you're compelled to return
again and again. However, on July 22, I had an experience that would forever
keep me at bay from returning to the place....It was my same friend, she forced
me to go there....we got out of the car. We crossed the gate and began walking
cautiously....She was holding my hand, praying prayers from her church that I
didn't know...she told me to pray with her and I didn't know them. I felt the
anger swelling, the quicksand rising, and then I saw the reflection of a dim
silver like light across the field. We stopped...and I said, "What is
that?!?!?!" Then, I got the strong instinct to LEAVE. I began to turn
around and said loudly, "Go, NOW."<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We took off running, crossed the gate and hopped into the parked car. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I shut the door quickly and locked it....and turned my head
and stared in disbelief at what was just on the other side of the fence. It was
a huge silvery white cloud of smoke, a haze just beyond the fence that I have
never seen before. There could have been no source for such a sight. After I
saw it, and she saw it, I said, "Drive, now." and she sped
away.....My other friend, religious and fearful and sitting in the backseat,
took my hand. He was holding a roseary in it....It burned my hand and left and
indentation, as usual but now only worse...My hands are always freezing after
being on that property. It always burns.... Needless to say, I will not venture
back to Honor Farm anytime soon...I don't suggest anyone go there. EVER. This
story may not seem like much; however, if you are receptive, be prepared to be
bombarded and weakened by the amount of strength that the farm possesses...also
be wary....the farm has a tendency to possess you. If you are compelled to
return, I do not condone your doing so....Praying is the only thing that seems
to help when you get home.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Hauntings That Follow</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: crimson_lilies@yahoo.com </p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Here are a few stories. It may be long, but it's certainly
interesting </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">enough to hold your attention.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I have encountered many paranormal activities since I was a
child.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Apparently things like this run in my family, but I seem to
be the only </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">one who has held on to my abilities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first encounter I can recall </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">was in Villa Rica,Ga.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I don't remember how old I was, but I know I was </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">really young.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
mother and I were driving to my aunts house late at </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">night. There was a store of some sort on the side of the
road which </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">looked to be very old.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Outside of the door stood a light up a-frame which </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">housed advertisements.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I noticed a figure moving around it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It had </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">huge white glowing eyes, and the best way I can explain it's
looks is by </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">telling you that it reminded me of spider man in the dark. I
yelled for </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">my mother to stop the car because the boogy man was standing
outside of </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">the store.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She told
me I was seeing things, but to this day she wishes </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">she had stopped the car. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I saw things through out my childhood so much, that most
nights I'd </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">wind up sleeping on my mothers floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We moved to TX when I was about 9, </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">the hauntings seem to follow me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I could tell that there was something wrong with the house
the second I </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">entered the doorway. I guess you could call it a feeling
that I had.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">always had trouble falling asleep, I would hear the sloshing
of boots </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">on wet carpet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Voices
that I knew were not my parents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Those
things </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">didn't seem to bother me that bad. hat DID bother me was
when I did fall </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">asleep, I'd wake up and could see an apparition floating
above me. It </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">had no recognizable shape to it. I'd stare at it and watch
it move for a </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">while. Then I'd run into my mothers room where, for some
reason, I felt </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">safe. The scariest thing I ever encountered in that house
was while my </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">room was being renovated. I slept in the living room on the
floor, and </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">on this night something jolted me out of a sound sleep. As I
lay on the </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">floor eyes wide open, I looked towards the kitchen. On the
wall to the </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">left of the kitchen was something I have NEVER seen, and I
hope I NEVER </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">see again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It stood
as tall as the ceilings did, so I'm guessing</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">about 8 to 9 feet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
was wearing a robe that covered the arms and </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">face so I never saw any kind of features. I felt threatened
by this </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">"creature" But I had no idea what to do.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The "creature" stood still as I </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">contemplated what actions would be best for me to take.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I darted up as </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">fast as I could and ran past the "creature". I
looked at it as I ran by, </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">and all my doubts of me hallucinating were gone. It reached
out towards </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">me but I managed to get past it. I took a sharp left turn
into my </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">mothers room where I ran to her side of the bed and hit my
knees. I buried </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">my head in her stomach and told her what I had seen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No one in my </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">family has ever doubted that I can not only see spirits, but
I can hear, </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">smell and feel them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I never saw that "creature" again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Just faint </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">whispers, the smell of something burning when nothing was
and footsteps.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">When I was 17 I decided to go to Job Corps in San Marcus
TX.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">particular campus is an actual old army base.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our dorm rooms were army </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">barracks where many soldiers had once slept.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My first encounter with an </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">apparition was in my dorm room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lights were always turned out but </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">the faint glow of fire escape lights lit up the dorm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was slee ng </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">when my eyes bolted open.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I could see a man with a rain pancho on, </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">covered in water. He appeared to be holding a lantern. He
was about 5 feet </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">away from me. His mouth was moving, but I never heard a
word. I closed </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">my eyes and fell back to sleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A few nights later I awoke to find the </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">man standing directly above me. I was on the bottom bunk,
and I still </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">can't believe no one else saw this man.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I could see the glow of the </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">lantern clearly, and his pancho was a shade of green. I
could see the </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">water dripping onto him as if he were being rained on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His lips were </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">moving as he look directly at me, but still I heard nothing.
I never felt</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">threatened by him, so I rolled over and fell back to
sleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Many of </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">the girls in my dorm reported seeing two children, a boy and
a girl, </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">playing with a bouncing ball. I never saw the children
myself but I never </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">doubted any ones story either.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I came home 6 months later to the house I never held too
dearly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">learned to ignore what I was hearing, and feeling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I didn't have any encounters for a while, until I met a guy
named </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Toney.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Toney was a
strange guy, he believed in things such as the </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Necronomicon. Some people say it's just a book written to
make money.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But after </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">living with Toney I believe it's VERY real.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Toney used to walk around </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">the house chanting in Sumerian, and if you've ever read the </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Necronomicon it warns you<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>NOT to chant anything out loud.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
swear even his cat </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">was possessed. It used to sit and stare at me, with these
big green </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">eyes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would attack
me for no reason. Once I woke up with it sitting on </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">my chest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Falling
asleep was very difficult for me, even though Toney </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">and I slept in the same bed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I could hear demonic breathing, it filled </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">the entire room.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Shadows would move across the walls. I could my name </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">being called out. This happened EVERY night that I lived
ere.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">started having nightmares on a nightly basis as well.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In my dream there </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">sat a demon upon my chest, talking to me in Sumerian. I
could feel the</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">weight of it as it sneered into my face.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would lower it's head </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">until it was touching mine. I'd wake up at that moment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Toney woke up a </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">few times, and he swears I was talking in Sumerian.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I moved out after a </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">year because the intensity of it all was becoming too much
for me to </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">handle.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Please bare with me, I promise I'm almost finished.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Nothing much happened. Until I was about 20.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I moved into an apartment </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">in Spring Branch and AGAIN, I could tell something was wrong
with it </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">the moment I walked through the threshold.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There were 3 of us living </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">there. Brandon, my boyfriend and I. Brandon took the bedroom
and Wes and I </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">slept in the living room on a small mattress. (we didn't
need no </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">stinking furniture!)<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The first weird thing happened a few nights after we </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">settled in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All three
of us would be in the living room and Brandon's TV </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">came on. Just a pitch black screen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It happened ALL the time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">imparticular night stands out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was home alone playing a video game, </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">when I heard Brandon's TV come on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I went into his room and turned it </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">off.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As soon as I sat
down, it came back on again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I got up
and turned </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">it off once more.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This time I turned off the light and closed the door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I could hear the TV come on again, but I ignored it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I laid down to go </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">to bed and from Brandon's room I could hear his blinds
rustling</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">around. (they were closed the last time I went in)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I ignored it and </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">fell asleep. When I woke up in the morning I decided to go
look in his </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The TV was off
and the blinds were pulled up and severely </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">tangled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That freaked
me out really bad.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It only happened
once, but still, </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I'll never forget it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There would be nume us times when I would be in </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">the bathroom fixing my hair and I'd see someone walk by the
door, even </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">though I was alone.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Once I even heard the front door open and I heard </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">a man call out my name, thinking it was one of the boys I
answered. No </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">one answered back. I heard the door close and I went to see
what was </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">going on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was
no one in my living room nor was there anyone on the </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">porch. My phone rang and it was Wes saying the he and
Brandon would be </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">home in a few minutes.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I moved out shortly after.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I am now 22 living in Blairsville, Ga. I've learned to
ignore the </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">spirits that follow me. There are times when I see things,
or smell </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">something funny.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
still hear my name being called out. I've started having </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">extremely weird but lucid dreams.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nothing really exciting has happened </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">to me in this house. If it does, you'll be the first to
know. I'm sure </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">between now and then, I'll remember some more of my
encounters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thank </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">for reading and I apologize for the length.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Family Farmland</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: littlefroggy76@hotmail.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">First of all, I want thank you so much for providing an
outlet for people with questions/concerns. I have had questions for many years
but had no idea who to talk to about them without the other person thinking I'm
crazy. I believe that more people believe in the supernatural then they would
like to admit.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Here is a little backgraound on me and my
"ghosts." I was born and raised in smalltown Millville, NJ. The land
my house was built on belonged to my ansestors. It used to be all farmland
until it was sold off piece by piece. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The house was built behind the original farmhouse and later
given to my mom and dad when they were married. My house was/is (?)
"haunted." I don't like the word haunted because it has gotten to be
known as a bad thing. In my case, the spirits that visited my family were
protective and very playful. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">They opened and closed closet doors, turned of the washer
and dryer, stuff like that. My dad is the only one that has physically seen the
"woman in white." When he described the woman to his mother she told
him that it sounded like his great-grandmother (father's side), whom he never
met. She showed him a picture and sure enough it was her. We believed she
watched over our house and protected us. Mostly my dad I believe. Dad told me
he used to sit in the livingroom with me in his lap and watch her walk in and
out of the walls. My dad and step-mom had spiritual meetings in the house. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">None that we knew about but we did find tapes later. The
medium told my parents of a "door." Same spot my dad used to watch
her walk in and out. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Years later my step-mother passed away, leaving my dad in a
great depression. He was remodling the kitchen one day when I went to visit
him. I asked my dad if she (his great-grandmother) had visited him anymore and
he said yes. He heard the floor creak like someone was walking in the kitchen
(even though he was alone) and he felt a cold hand on his shoulder, not 10
minutes before I came over. He then felt like everything was going to be
alright.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I know that a spirits reside in places, homes, businesses
and the like. But is it possible for a spirit to move with an individual? I
guess that is the biggest question for me. I find it had to believe that ALL
the houses I have lived in are haunted. I am 28 now and have moved alot in the
10 years I have been on my own. I can tell you a story or two about all of
these places. As a child I had several imaginary friends. Soon after my sister
was born, my family told me they all went away. The thing is I don't believe
one of them was imaginary or went away. I FEEL someone with me almost all the
time: at home, work, in my car. I find myself talking to SOMEONE when I am
lonely or depressed. I can FEEL him "answer" me at times. He is not
always there. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Where he goes I don't know. I don't believe in angels, in
the Christian sense (you know with feather-wings and come from heaven). I say
him because I believe I saw him in my bedroom mirror one night. I was lying in
bed one night talking to my boyfriend. We were loving discussing our
relationship. I saw movement in my mirror. Impossible as we were the only ones
in the room. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I saw a figure standing where my desk should have been. I
saw a boy about 16, sandy-blond hair, very handsome. He was dressed
fashionably. He was smiling at me. I had a feeling that he was trying to tell
me that he was happy for me. Then he was gone. He wasn't transparent and didn't
fade away. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">He just disappeared. I know it was the same being that has
been with me because the feeling was the same, but until that night I had never
seen him before. When he left I cried. I told my boyfriend what I saw. He asked
if I was scared because I was crying. I told him I wasn't scared. I had no
reason to be scared, but I didn't know then or now why I was brought to tears.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I have two small children now and live in <st1:State><st1:place>Florida</st1:place></st1:State>.
Since my second (a girl) was born my friend has been around more and more. She
is 4 now and I think he is visiting her or she has a friend of her own. One
night about 2 years ago, I had a friend over. She woke up screaming. She kept
pointing at the mirror of her little plastic vanity and screaming my friends
name over and over again. I told her that he wasn't in the mirror because he
was in the other room but she wouldn't calm down. Finally I turned the vanity
around and she laid back down. A little while later she started to talk to an
imaginary friend. I hear her at night singing and giggling. I think she is
playing with her brother or toys, but he is usually asleep when I go in and she
doesnt have any toys. When I ask her who she was talking to she usually says
"I'm just singing to myself."</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Is it possible that my daughter and I have the same
connection. A connection to our "own" spirit? Is is possible that
what we (or just me) hare experiencing a being that may never have been alive,
but something else? I have never felt menaced by any of the beings I have come
acrossed.</p>
