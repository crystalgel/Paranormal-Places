<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I thought you may want to update your information on the
Harrison Church at S.W. 16th and Harrison - It is not abandoned, and hasn't
been for about four an half years now, as one of the owners I can confirm
this... </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>One other thing I can also confirm is that the rumors of it
being Haunted are not rumors at all, the activity there is real and pretty
consistent. As I can not be there on location on a regular basis I hired
Caretakers to care for and watch over the building - maybe I should have told
them about the Church's reputation before they signed on and moved in, but I
did not I decided not to put things in their head that may have otherwise not
been there. Well it only took about two weeks before I started getting calls
asking me for information on the Church and if there was anything they should
know due to some strange things happening in the Chapel. I dispersed some info in
small quantities, again not wanting to make a mountain out of a mole hill,
however the mountain showed it's face all on it's own, and one of the
Caretakers for a lack of a better explanation, was temporarily possessed while
someone that claimed to be a former preacher from the 50's sent over a message
rega rding a double murder that took place in the boiler room and upper loft of
the church.. Ooops, guess I should have been a little more forthcoming with my
information. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Lucky for me and my business partner the Caretakers have not
as of yet been spooked away, in fact they are intrigued and while investigating
and trying to verify the information they were given 'that night' they have
found a way to live among the 'regulars' that pass back and fourth through the
Chapel on a daily basis. Yes it's hard to believe for me also, but what scares
some makes others curious - Me? I'm happy in my own home far far away from the
Church *smile wink* </big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>GHOST FROM THE <st1:place w:st="on">ALAMO</st1:place></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>In 2001, I had accepted a short term work assignment at
through a temporary employment agency working at the famed <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Humble</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Building</st1:PlaceType>,
and I had the pleasure of working with the staff of what was now called the <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">ExxonMobil</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Building</st1:PlaceType>
in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Houston</st1:City>, <st1:State w:st="on">Texas</st1:State></st1:place>, as an Administrative Assistant, and
my office was on the 32nd floor.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>My job with ExxonMobil required working on several projects
and on some days, I had to take several trips to the copier to prepare a
perfect original copy, which sometimes required frequent trips to the
Reproduction Department, on the lowest level in the basemen to make several
copies of documents to be distributed at the meetings that my managers had
during the year. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>The first few times I rode on the elevator of the ExxonMobil
building, to the Reproduction Department, I rode the elevator down to the Lower
Level (LL) to deliver the pages to be copied, and another ride back up to the
32nd floor. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>On one of the many rides I took on an elevator, I felt a
warm hand touching my left cheek, and I heard a male voice calling me Mam. I
could see no one standing there, and I felt a chill move up my back into my
neck, .then I caught a glimpse of an apparition move from behind me into my
line of sight. The man was taller than me, and was wearing a hat, and wore a
holster with a gun.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>"Mam, Can you please tell me what year it is?" </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I felt chills running up my neck again. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I had heard voices from ghosts many times in my life, but
never once did I have the ghost of a famous person speak directly to me. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I answered him. "The year is 2001." </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Can you see me? He asked. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>"No" I answered him as I closed my eyes. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>"My name is Captain William B. Travis, and I need to
know who won at the <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Battle</st1:place></st1:City>
of the </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><st1:place w:st="on">Alamo</st1:place>?" </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>"Santa Anna won." I answered.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Captain William B. Travis then lowered his head and mumbled
failure. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>"You and all the other men, women and children who died
at the <st1:place w:st="on">Alamo</st1:place>, are heroes in </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>the history books of <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:State w:st="on">Texas</st1:State></st1:place>."
I told him.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>"Raise your head and feel proud that your life story
and those that died at the <st1:place w:st="on">Alamo</st1:place> are written
in the history books that are used in our children's schools."</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>You need to know that the Alamo fell to Santa Anna, but your
lives go on, and Captain, the children of today are able to read about you and
the history of the <st1:place w:st="on">Alamo</st1:place> on any computer, or
any book on that subject.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>He then asked me with a puzzled look on his face, "What
is a computer?"</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Captain William B. Travis disappeared from the elevator as
we reached the lower floor, and after that day, I saw him frequently riding on
the elevators, but he seldom spoke. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>He acknowledged me with a fingertip on the brim of his
Captain&#8217;s hat.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I believe once he knew the truth about the Battle of The
Alamo, he could go on with living his spirit life at the ExxonMobile Building,
until he could go forward into the afterlife.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>As far as I know, a few people still believe in ghosts, and
more often encounter them in the most obvious of places, like in the <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">ExxonMobil</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Building</st1:PlaceType>
on <st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">Bell Street</st1:address></st1:Street>
in downtown <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Houston</st1:City>, <st1:State w:st="on">Texas</st1:State></st1:place>. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>To this day, Captain William B. Travis still rides the
elevators and greets the women with a smile, and a fingertip to the brim of his
Captain&#8217;s hat, but few of the people that ride the elevators are aware of his
presence.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Have you seen Captain William B. Travis when you rode the
elevator today?</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>GHOSTS OF A FATHER AND HIS SON</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>My son had just entered the Art Institute in 1992, and while
he attended college in the daytime studying Music and Video Business, I was
taking evening classes in Applied Photography. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>The instructor was a teacher in Basic Photography, which I
was taking to earn an Associate of Applied Science Degree. I had her as my
instructor the first quarter of school. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Miss Monroe asked my son and me if we wanted to make some
extra money by cleaning her bi-level townhouse every Saturday, and my son and I
both liked the idea of making extra money. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>The first day we arrived at her home, she began to tell us
about the two ghosts that also lived in her home. The ghostly pair were a
father and son. The father was a doctor who knew he was dying of cancer, and
wanted his son to agree not to marry a woman who he was engaged to, that was of
Hispanic descent, and had planned to marry against his father's will. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>The son wanted his father's approval but did not receive it,
and left to go back to <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType w:st="on">University</st1:PlaceType>
 of <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Texas</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>. The son had
driven in from <st1:City w:st="on">Austin</st1:City>, <st1:State w:st="on">Texas</st1:State>,
where he had been attending the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType w:st="on">University</st1:PlaceType>
 of <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Texas</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>, and he could
hardly wait to get back to his fiancee, so they could be married. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>His father died knowing that his only son was still planning
to marry the same woman that he had disapproved of, but what he did not know at
first, was that his son was killed in an automobile accident while driving back
to <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Austin</st1:place></st1:City>, and
the marriage never took place. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Thinking that his son had married the woman, he refused to
talk to him, when his son died, and came back to explain to his father that the
marriage did not happen, his father refused to allow his son to enter the
house, and told his son to stay out in the garage. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Miss Monroe told my son and me the story of the ghosts of
the father and son, and asked me if I could walk with her through the house to
see if my son or I could pick up anything on either ghost and tell her what I
felt from the visit. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>My son decided to continue his house cleaning while I walked
with my instructor to an upstairs bedroom, that she furnished with a double
bed, and a desk. Then when we arrived in the bedroom, she immediately asked if
I could pick up any feelings about the bedroom. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I told her yes, I could hear the father talking to me. I
could not see him at first, but when he moved further away from me toward the
other side of his bed, but I could hear him speak. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>He told me he had heard about me, the woman who could hear
voices of people who were no long living, and then asked me about his hobby and
what it was that he loved more than anything before he died. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I received a thought in my mind that had to do with orchids,
and when I told him the thought I picked up from him, he became frightened and
stepped farther away from me. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>He also asked me to give a message to the woman who lived in
his house, who was standing right next to me, to buy more Pop Tarts, because
that is what he loved to eat. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>When I told Miss Monroe what it was the ghost had said, she
and I both laughed, then she began telling me how her warm Pop Tarts would
disappear from the kitchen counter, after she warmed them and left them on the
counter to cool. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I told the doctor that I enjoyed talking with him, and he
said okay, but that he was afraid of me because I could hear him. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Where was the other ghost, the ghost of his son? The father
told me, his son was living in the garage because he had not forgiven his son
for even thinking of marrying a woman he did not approve of. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>When we left the house to go outside to the greenhouse, I
could smell the orchids, although nothing was in the planters except dirt, but
when I looked up toward the doctor's bedroom window, he was standing there
watching us, and making doubly sure that his son did not leave the garage and
follow us into the house. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>We opened the garage door and we both heard the sound of
shuffling feet scurrying away to hide. The son was leaning against the far wall
of the garage. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>The ghostly son's question took me by surprise. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>When was his father going to let him back into the house
because the garage was cold and damp? I told him I would ask his father. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>The moment I came out of the garage and looked up toward the
bedroom window, I heard the father say no, as he shook his head. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>The son apologized to his father out loud again, and the
father refused to hear his son speak. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>The conversation then ended and the father remained in the
house looking out through his bedroom window, and his son remained in the cold
damp garage, waiting, and hoping his father would change his mind, then they
both faded away, and I could not hear or see either ghost again before my son
and I left to go back home. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>THE GHOST OF THE RED CAVALIER</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>For years, I drove a Ford and Escort was its name, and it
was great throughout but the air inside would not get cold.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So I asked my boyfriend, Tom, to take me to
buy a car, that I desperately needed, because the air conditioner in my Ford
Escort was going to cost more than the car was worth to fix, so we went to
Chuck Davis Chevrolet, to look for a pretty new car to buy.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I saw a Geo Metro that was maroon inside and out, and it
would be a perfect car for me to drive, since it was small, and a gas saver,
but Tom wanted to drive it, and the air conditioner was not blowing very
cold.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More Freon would be needed so the
air would blow cold air, and I fell in love with that little car.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Tom kept bugging me, to buy a larger car, a
red 1999 Chevrolet Cavalier for both of us to drive, and if I could not pay for
it, he would give it to his daughter, Tracey, but I would not agree to
that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I wanted the little car, then Tom
went to see the salesman and ask for the keys to the red Cavalier.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>He wanted to take it for a drive, so what could I do? I had
once loved this man, and he was stubborn, and when he insisted that I buy the
red Cavalier that day, he let me borrow $500 to add in to the down payment, and
I put down $500 too, and the dealer gave me a rebate of $500 more. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>It felt like dream, and I wanted to scream&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;. as I waved
goodbye to the Geo Metro, all I wanted was to strangle this man&#8217;s neck, because
I ended up with the red devil car, and not the little Geo Metro I wanted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Oh what the hell?</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>The man named Tom drove the new Cavalier home, and I drove
his old truck, and my new Cavalier had a dent on its butt which I had not seen,
but the man named Tom knew&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; and did not tell me. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>The salesman told him the story about that the red devil car
that had been a former drug car that was owned by drug people, which was seized
by the law and the FBI broke the trunk to see what they could find but that was
why the trunk had a dent in it. and now the red devil car was mine, and I hated
it.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I tried to give it to Tom, but then
he did not want it. Two weeks from the day I brought home the car, I backed up
into a tree, and broke the car trunk latch.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>So I went to buy another trunk latch and I fixed the damn thing, but
when I went to eat in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Sugar</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Land</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>, the red devil car
was hit from behind.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Another dent to see, what was happening to me? I tried
desperately to give the car away but I was stuck driving a devil car from Hell.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Some time went by, and I went out to eat again. I stopped
for some gasoline in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Sugar</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Land</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>, and a pickup truck
plowed into my car in the gas station stall and the man was 86 years old, and
did not see my car.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Another $600 damage and the other driver&#8217;s insurance paid
with a check, and I had saved to fix the bumper, because this had made me upset
and sick.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Tom chose this stupid car, and he should have taken it home
with him for his daughter, since he chose this devil car, it should be at home
with him, and that is not the end of this nightmare car.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>One morning I was driving to work, and about a year had
passed since the car and me had been in any other car accidents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A stupid man ran a stop sign and ran into the
red devil car again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was not hurt, but
I could see, the devil car was struck again and I could only cry, because it
was not my fault.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The man ran a stop
sign and refused to pay the debt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I
got out of the car to try to exchange information with the other man, a ghost
came out of the car and stood beside me on the street.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I did not recognize the man, and he did not
look like a devil.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I ignored him, and I
prayed no one else could see him.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>A policeman was called to take our information, and the other
driver cried that I was at fault.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
told the policeman, that while I was driving down the street, that he assumed
that I was supposed to stop in the middle of the street, and let him go by,
because that was the way things were done in Mexico. He ran a stop sign, and he
lied to the policeman to keep from paying for the $3,000 damage on my car. My
insurance paid to fix my car again, and that man won because he did not pay for
the damages on my the devil car.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Three years have passed, the devil car won&#8217;t die, as long as
it is red the devil car gets wrecked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So
then I painted it blue, no crashes yet, then I painted it white, then
black.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The car had not been hit, but
cops would follow me when my car was black. So I painted the devil car an angel
white.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The car looked bright and there
was no devil car around, and the ghost appeared to be gone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The car had not been hit, but people driving
around me would frown on my paint job.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I was told by many people that I had spent too much money,
painting my car different colors.... that I should have left it red, but they
did not really know the sadness that I felt inside.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>When the maroon little Geo Metro moved into the building
across the driveway, I saw the lucky driver that bought the cute little
car.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He said that he bought the car at
Chuck Davis Chevrolet the same day, that I brought the red devil car home to <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Fresno</st1:City></st1:place>, because I did not
get my way, and because the curse of the red car had followed me for years. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>You see the story is not over yet, I still have to say I
bought the red car in June, and in July, I had my first stroke.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And here it is 4 years later, the car was
parked at home, the cold air went out and then I went out and bought a
beautiful 2004 <st1:City w:st="on">Pontiac</st1:City>, and I had<span style="">&nbsp; </span>massive stroke, and my brand new <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Pontiac</st1:City></st1:place> went back to the
dealership.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In 2005, an attorney called
me to say that they are going to sue me since the red car was painted
black.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The attorney has asked why I
painted it, I did not know what to say&#8230;. I tried for years to forget the
reasons why&#8230; and now the curse is back, what can I say?</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>The attorney wanted me to pay for the paint job that I gave
the Red Devil car.. to keep the curse away, and now the car is gone, and the
curse is gone away, and the ghost is gone but now I don&#8217;t worry about it, because
I cannot drive anyway and the attorney has stopped threatening to take me to
court for $6,000, when my sisters told him we were filing Harassment charges on
him and his company, because I was now living in a nursing home, and I have
seven years on my credit report for the &#8220;repossession&#8221; of the devil car, but
that will soon be gone too.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>GHOSTS OF THE LINDALE SUBDIVISION</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>In 1966, my parents bought the largest house on <st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">Fairbanks Street</st1:address></st1:Street> in
the Lindale Subdivision on the north side of downtown <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Houston</st1:place></st1:City>.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>My eldest sister, Lindy, was graduating from high school,
going to her senior prom, and preparing to go out into the world by working at
her first job, and she was ready to go, and my second sister, Rosie, was also
older than me, and was in her the 11th grade and still had her last two years
of high school, and she was due to graduate in 1967.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was called Laurie, and I was going to the
same high school, but I was only in the 10th grade and I still had a lot to
learn about high school.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Rosie and I rode the city bus to and from school every day,
and always had tons of homework to do, so when we were able to finally get home
from riding the city bus to our bus stop, we walked home from out there to our
house which was about three-fourths of a city block, and walked inside the back
yard to be greeted at the back door by our black cocker spaniel puppy named
Putty.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Daddy was almost always at home waiting for us, except that
in 1966, Daddy had become ill again, and Mom and Lindy took Daddy to the
Veteran&#8217;s Administration Hospital by city ambulance, and Rosie and I had to fix
our after school snacks, finish our homework, fix supper for ourselves and Mom
and Lindy, and then take out the ironing board and iron our skirts and blouses
for school the next day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rosie was always
smarter than me, as she always ironed her clothes for the entire week on
Sunday, but sometimes one of her clubs at school called a club meeting, and she
had to iron a blouse that night to wear the next day.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Rosie and I would read movie star magazines, or do our
homework, and listen to our 45 records playing on our record player, while
sitting on our double bed, and we would roll up our hair in giant pink rollers
to get ourselves ready for the next day at school.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I was the first person to see something moving in our
bedroom, and I told Rosie that I saw something, but I could not see a clear
picture, and she said she could not see anything at all, and she took it all in
stride.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rosie was pretty cool about it,
but I was concerned, and I wanted to talk to Mom, but she had gone to see
Daddy, and was not there with right then when I was afraid.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Rosie and I were both singing to one of the 45's on the
record player, and I stopped when I saw the two ghosts standing inside the big
blue fan blowing air in one corner of the room.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The ghosts were embracing and kissing, and had a hold on each other
tightly.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Then, I noticed that the male ghost was wearing a gray civil
war uniform, and the hat of a captain, and a sword in a scabbard hanging on his
waist belt, and the woman was wearing a<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>green ball gown with full skirt filled with petticoats under the skirt,
and her bodice was dark green velvet.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She appeared to be crying, as they held each other tightly.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Rosie could not see any of it, but I described everything I
saw that night, and I told her that it was funny to me that I could see them,
and we were learning all about the Civil War in my American History Class in
10th grade.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had found that similarity
to be strange and funny.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I finally got the courage to tell Mom when she got home from
visiting Daddy at the hospital that night, and she told me that if there were
ghosts, they were not going to hurt me, and left it at that.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I saw the couple several times after that day, but they
never once paid any attention to me.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>GHOST AT <st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">1003
  JAMES STREET</st1:address></st1:Street></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>My family of six lived in this house on <st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">James Street</st1:address></st1:Street>, in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Houston</st1:City>, <st1:State w:st="on">Texas</st1:State></st1:place>,
and it was a great place for us to grow up with a fence to keep our Putty dog
in, to my little brother having his own bedroom and bathroom, and my sisters and
I having our bedroom and bathroom.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>The middle bedroom was large and had three doors, one that
could be entered from</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>from the living room, one door that could be entered from
the kitchen, and the third door could be entered from a long hallway to my
brother&#8217;s room that passed right by the second bathroom, that was complete with
to a shower stall, for three young growing girls.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>This house was perfect in every way, except that it had a
secret that no one in the neighborhood remembered except for the owner, who
told my father, and me, only because I was listening to the owner telling my
father, about a man who had been killed in the middle bedroom, and the murderer
had never been caught.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>When I heard the owner telling my father about the murder
that took place in our bedroom, I couldn&#8217;t wait to tell my sisters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I suddenly felt fear knowing that my sisters
and I were going to be sleeping, in the same room, where a man had been
murdered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was not good news, and I
felt fear and excitement at the same time.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>When we finally moved into this house, it completely took me
by surprise when I saw the ghost standing in the living room, when the owner
was showing my parents through the house.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was not my first encounter with a ghost, but it was the first time I
had an encounter with the ghost of a man who had died in our bedroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was still there, and he didn&#8217;t know why,
and he didn&#8217;t know how to ask why he was still there, only because he thought
he was still alive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>After we moved into the house, the ghost watched me walk out
the front door to school or when I played in the yard with our dog.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I could see him standing at the window right
behind the bedroom curtains, behind the curtains in the living room, or when he
was standing at the front door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
followed me everywhere I went in the house, but he never followed me outside
our home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Since I was still a kid, I thought he was old, in his late
20's, or 30's, but I didn&#8217;t know for sure, and I never thought to ask him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The ghost was not a pest, but he did not understand
why he was still here on earth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I could
see through him when he stood next to me, trying to talk with me, and I felt
chills going up and down my back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I told
my father that the ghost was talking to me a lot, and that I wanted to go and
hide from the ghost, so that he would not talk to me.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>One day when my brother and my sisters were home, I hid in
my brother&#8217;s bedroom closet, and waited to see what would happen if I stayed
hidden.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The ghost could not find me if
he could not see me, or so I thought.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Little did I know that the whole<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>time I was hiding in the closet, I felt so secure, and warm sitting on a
pile of my brother&#8217;s blankets, and extra pillows, and when my father asked all
my sisters and brother, where I was and nobody knew,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>but Daddy finally found me hiding in my
brother&#8217;s bedroom closet, and he asked me why I was sitting on the lap of a
ghost.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I screamed &#8220;No!&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
jumped up and ran into my father&#8217;s arms, and I told him I was afraid of the
ghost talking to me.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>My father hugged me, then took me to my room, wiped away my
tears, and told me to always remember that ghosts cannot hurt me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They only want to know why they are still
here on earth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Daddy then told me said that the answer that the ghosts
needed was something only God could answer, and I suddenly felt a feeling of
peace.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>A GHOST CALLED MELCHOR</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>It was so difficult to understand what exactly was happening
to me the very first time I heard a man&#8217;s voice in my head. He spoke loud and
clear, warning me that he was just waiting patiently for me to slip just one
time, and that was all he needed to take over my body.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I had just climbed up to the top of the baseball bleachers
at <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Moody</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Park</st1:PlaceType>,
a city park, just 4 miles north of downtown <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Houston</st1:place></st1:City>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was a great view from 12 feet above ground, and the ship created, in
my 12-year old imagination, moved quietly through the waves, I looked around
from the crow&#8217;s nest of my ship. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I christened it "Laurie&#8217;s Ship."<span style="">&nbsp; </span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>From where I stood, at the height of 12 feet, I called out
to my brothers and sisters standing in the baseball diamond, to look at me. I
was he Captain on my own ship, and I could see everything, from where I was
standing.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>After I looked out in one direction, I started turning my
body to look another direction, and as I moved my right foot to the edge of the
top bleacher seat, where there was no back wall, and my hand slipped, and I
lost my hold on the rail. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Right then, It felt like someone had pushed me from behind,
and my hands slid from the off the top rail, and boom, I landed on the ground
knocking the wind out of my lungs, and hitting the back of my head hard enough
to see stars spinning above my head.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I felt my spiritual body rise up, and very slowly move away
from my body, and I felt free. I felt light, and I felt like jumping up and
down, and all around. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I already had forgotten that I had no human body, but I
looked around me, and I saw me on the ground trying to breathe.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I was discovering it was like to live
without my body. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I heard a woman talking to me.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She told me that she was my grandmother, my
Dad&#8217;s mother, Matilde, to call her Mama and that she was with me to tell me
that it was not my time to go to Heaven, and that I needed to go back into my
body.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My grandmother walked my spiritual
body back to my human body, and asked me to lay my spiritual body down into my
human body, and I discovered, I could not connect with my human body, and I
kept floating up out of my body.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>When my grandmother asked me what was wrong, I told her
there was something moving under me inside of my human body.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That it was a man and he was yelling at me,
that his name was Melchor and that he was here to keep me from being alive
again. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>My grandmother then heard Melchor tell her that he had been
following me for many years waiting for this day, when he could finally take my
body away from me, and I would be dead, and he would be alive again.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I watched my Grandmother stick both her hands into my human
body and pull out Melchor&#8217;s spiritual body, and pushed him away as hard as she
could, then gently laid my spiritual body down into my human body, and I
connected with my human body again.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Suddenly, I felt the pain in my lungs while I was grasping for air.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I could not catch my breath.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My grandmother instructed to wait patiently,
and my brother would come to help me.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>She then told me that she had heard in Heaven about the man
in black called Melchor, who was a monk with a black hat and a black robe, and
who had died in the 15th century by hanging.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Melchor had been trying for many years to take over the bodies of people
who had suddenly died.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Mama told me that she would always be near me, in order to
protect me from Melchor and others like him, and gave me a kiss on my
forehead.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She said that I would see and
hear strange things throughout my life, that would frighten me, but could not
hurt me.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>My Grandmother then said goodbye and faded away.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>My older brother grabbed my right hand and pulled me up onto
my feet, and told me everything was going to be okay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He gently pulled leaves out of my hair, then
he stood in front of me and looked me in the eyes, and told me not to tell
Daddy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I said I won&#8217;t tell Daddy, I promise, and I started walking
towards Daddy's car, holding my brother's hand, and Daddy took one look at me
and asked me what had happened to me, and I told him nothing, but somehow Daddy
always knew what happened, so we never said a word to Daddy.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I remembered later that my brother did not pay any attention
to the man in the black robe, if we were both alive, and as I looked again from
my brother&#8217;s face to the man in black running away from us, it became obvious
that the man was "see-through" like a ghost. I did not understand,
but the feeling of peace was with me.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I could not say anything at all about what had happened, and
as we sat in Daddy&#8217;s car and drove out of Moody Park, I looked outside the car
window, and saw Melchor shaking his finger at me, and his mouth was moving, but
I could not hear him and I could not read his lips, then he slowly faded away.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>THE GHOST IN MIDVALE, <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">UTAH</st1:place></st1:State></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>In 2001, I took a trip to visit cousins by marriage. I
enjoyed visiting Steve and Vera, in Midvale, <st1:State w:st="on">Utah</st1:State>,
because they were happily married, and lived in the oldest, most beautiful
house on <st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">Allen Street</st1:address></st1:Street>
in Midvale, <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Utah</st1:place></st1:State>.
</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Vera&#8217;s mother had died a few years before I went to visit
there that year, but I had the pleasure of meeting her in years past, on other
trips to visit Steve and Vera. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>The ghost of Vera&#8217;s Mom returned to protect Steve and Vera&#8217;s
property and the family, and for some reason, she had taken an instant dislike
to me and my son, but I still treated her with respect and kindness when she
was living, and came to visit Steve and Vera, and I was there too. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>When I went to visit Steve and Vera in March, 2001, I slept
on a small futon-like couch in the front room, and I had planned to stay for a
whole week, but the first night I was there, I heard the voice of Vera&#8217;s mother
asking me so nicely to leave and go back home, and she thought it was better if
I went home. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I told her I was very sorry that I could not remember her
name, so that I could address her by name, and she stated that it was fine, and
that I was not going to be there long enough. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I had planned to stay for a week, and I was sure something
bad was going to happen while I was there, because I could feel a queasy
feeling in my stomach, but I never told Steve and Vera, that Vera&#8217;s mother had
been to visit me. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>During my visit to Midvale, the daytime hours were fun. We
took a trip to <st1:City w:st="on">Wendover</st1:City>, <st1:State w:st="on">Nevada</st1:State>,
taking a few quarters I had won in a layover stop in <st1:City w:st="on">Las
 Vegas</st1:City>, on my flight to <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Salt
  Lake City</st1:City>, <st1:State w:st="on">Utah</st1:State></st1:place>. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Steve, Vera and I had fun playing slots, but we never won
anything more than a few dollars back from the nickel and quarter slots. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>When we came back home that night rather late, I finally
fell asleep on the front couch again. I had been visiting Steve and Vera for
about three days, when Vera&#8217;s mother came to tell me that third night to tell
me that the man I lived with, had poisoned my favorite dog, called Jumper, and
all 12 of her puppies, and they were all buried before I got back home. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I told Steve and Vera that I felt that something bad
happened back home, where I lived with the man I once loved, and who I thought
loved my precious dog, Jumper, and her 12 puppies. Vera&#8217;s mother also told me
that the man I live with had shot Jumper&#8217;s brother, once in the hip, and once
in the head, and that if that man could kill animals, there was a thin line
there from there to where he could possibly kill me also, if he ever thought
that I might be in his way. She then added that I could be next. I suddenly
felt sick to my stomach, and I felt it all the way to <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Utah</st1:place></st1:State>. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I called the airline and changed my flight to go home, to
check on my precious dog, Jumper, and all I wanted was to check on my precious
dog, Jumper, and I left the next afternoon on Thursday, to find out that my
feelings had come true. Jumper and all 12 puppies had been poisoned, and when I
first confronted Tom, he was surprised to see me, and was busy chasing Jumper&#8217;s
brother around the yard. The dog was limping, and bleeding from one hip. I ask
him who shot him and he looked at me directly and lied. He told me the man in
the mobil home to the side of his sister&#8217;s property had shot the brother dog,
and because it was injured, Tom had to finish killing him off. Then I heard
gunfire from Tom&#8217;s 22 pistol, and the male dog yipped and then died in his
sister&#8217;s front yard. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I thought back to my trip to <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Utah</st1:place></st1:State> during the early part of that week, and
in all my rushing home to save Jumper, her 12 puppies, and her brother, and I
did not save any of them, but I learned from Vera&#8217;s mother. She helped me
figure out the truth about my life, my relationship with a man who kills pet
dogs, and the reminder that this man could easily turn on me. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>The ghost of Midvale, <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Utah</st1:place></st1:State>
saved my life and opened my eyes to the truth, and also told me that in July of
that same year, 2001, I would have a double stroke, and I would lose Tom to
another woman. I thanked her for the information and I flew back to <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Texas</st1:place></st1:State> to face my pain,
and greet my new life without Tom. I knew I would succeed, and the knowledge
and the pain I gained along the way had made me stronger and ready for any new
challenge. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>GHOST OF A SPECIAL MAN</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Several years ago, I had a crush on a man who lived in a
neighborhood where one of my sisters lived. He worked as a prison guard, and as
a constable, to fill the hours of his day doing things he loved to do.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the years went by, he married, divorced,
and then had a live-in lover for a few years, and eventually became a loner, and
lived alone.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>But in spite of all the bad things I had about him, I heard
through the neighborhood grapevine, that all he ever wanted to do his whole
life was to be a police officer.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Because this wonderful man had Crohn's disease, which
affected his bowels, and he was only able to serve in the capacity of a
constable, which I had heard was a great way to gain experience as a police
officer, and protect the neighborhood.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>After several years of working as a constable, this
wonderful man also had a terrible secret that he carried with him throughout
his life. He had a terrible disease called Crohn&#8217;s disease, and later the
doctors discovered he had cancer that was found and removed in several
surgeries.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>On April 21, 2003, my sister called me to let me know that
this great man had been hospitalized for a few weeks, and had died on April 10,
2003.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>It came as a tremendous shock to me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The soft-hearted little man with the big
round glasses, that I had fallen in love with, had died.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I hung up the phone. I sat down on the bed,
and cried my eyes out into my pillow. It was soaked from my tears.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Later that night, after I had regained control of my
emotions, I spread some blankets on the carpet in the living room, and played
some of my cassette tapes that reminded me of him.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>That is when I first realized how many ghosts were sitting
on the blankets with me, and that was when my sweet little man, Duane, that has
just passed away, walked into my apartment through the bedroom closet door,
with his round rimmed glasses and a smile for every one there in my apartment
that night.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="">&nbsp;</span>All the ghosts that
were in my apartment that night called out his name in unison,
"Duane?"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>&#8220;Hi!&#8221;</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I looked up and looked around my room, but I could not seen
anyone, until </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I heard Duane speaking to me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He called me by name, and told me he had to
wait for a long time after his orientation into Heaven, before he could get the
permission to come back to earth to visit his mother and his aunt, and some of
his neighbors, and me.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Duane came to visit me every day after he completed his what
he called "have to do's in Heaven.&#8221;</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>He stayed for a few more weeks, and then he faded away. The
other ghosts that were in my apartment that day, never let me know again that
they were still there in my apartment.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I never heard from Duane after he came to tell me that he
had met a woman named Carole whose parents lived in a house next door to my
parents. She was planning to be his best friend, and she could give him a
personal tour of heaven.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>That was the last time Duane came to visit me was sometime
in late 2003, and I miss him very much.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>With Duane visiting me less and less, I missed him so
much.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I could sometimes hear him singing
to me, or whispering gentle words of love and encouragement, then he didn&#8217;t
come back for a long time, and I began to adjust to living without him, but I
never stopped loving him.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Addition to "The <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Windsor</st1:place></st1:City>
Haunting"</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>By: jan.ron@cogeco.ca </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>05/11/2007</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I am writing this as a footnote to my previous story &#8220; The
Windsor Haunting&#8221;.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Approximately ten months ago my husband stared a new job out
of town. He lived and worked away from home for five months.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Now, as I previously stated, I always feel quite at ease
here at home and so the incident I am about to relate came as quite a surprise.
However, it did not &#8220;scare&#8221; me as much as I would have thought. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>We had gotten up early the morning my husband left. It was
about 10AM when he got on his way. I've never been much of a morning person and
so, as I didn't have anything pressing to keep me up I decided to take a nap.
My bedroom is rather bright, and so I choose to nap in the basement. It is
almost pitch black down there and very comfortable. My husband had it set up
that way when he worked nights. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Well, I was lying there in the dark and heard to my amazement
the faint yet unmistakable strum of a guitar! I kept my cool and tried to
rationalize how this was possible. I remembered that there was indeed a guitar
resting against a corner wall. My brother had given it to my husband several
years ago. My husband didn't play but even so it was a source of entertainment
to try for the couple of times he picked it up. It had been in that corner for
a long time since. Anyway, back to the incident. I finally decided lying there
to turn on the light to gather my bearings. Several minutes later I thought,
&#8220;this is silly,&#8221; I turned the light out and sure enough, several seconds later,
I heard the strum once again! I swore and jumped out of the bed more annoyed at
the disturbance of my nap then scared. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I am beginning to accept the fact that we are probably not
alone here. Seemingly, there is no malice. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>My brother, who gave my husband the guitar passed away in
August. His loving and heartbroken wife claims he has visited her. He was a
firm believer in the afterlife and I'm sure if there were a way to come back,
he would. They say that as we get older we become more childlike. I believe
that is true. We become more aware and accepting of the reality that is as
fascinating as it is incredible!</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Bump in the Laundry Room</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I don't have any pretenses towards seeing the unexplained.
But some things do make one wonder. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>The other day I was in my laundry room, putting some stuff
on hangers, and hanging them on the door frame, between the laundry room and the
breakfast nook/kitchen. I turned to my left to do something and out of the
corner of my right eye thought I saw a dark, man shaped something stroll into
my vision, in the kitchen/nook. When I looked back to check there was nothing
there. I didn&#8217;t think there would be, as it wasn&#8217;t that clear and really quick.
I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me. It took a second or two to
register that the shirts were swinging back and forth as if someone had moved
them to get by. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>At the time it was no big deal, and didn&#8217;t scare me. Now
that I am thinking about it it&#8217;s kind of strange. Just thought I&#8217;d mention it.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I grew up in Valentine and moved to <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">North Platte</st1:place></st1:City> when I was in 6th Grade. I had a
friend that I would visit in Valentine every summer and I would stay in their
house for a couple of weeks.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>The family went to a rodeo one night and I chose to stay at
the house and watch TV by myself. No big deal, I have been hanging out in the
house for years although, this is the first time I was alone. I was downstairs
watching tv and I heard a baby crying. I thought it was probably coming from
outside and ignored it. Then I heard it again only louder. Well, this time I
got up to investigate. I realized that it was coming from the stairwell going upstairs.
As I approached the stairs, the crying baby clearly became louder and I poked
my head around the corner of the stairs and it stopped. I went back to watching
tv and within a few minutes, I heard another noise upstairs. I sounded like a
cart rolling. That was it, I decided to check it out. I went upstairs and there
was a cart at the end of the hallway that was, earlier in the day at the other
end of the hallway. I did not hear the crying anymore however.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I mentioned my experience to the family and they said that
had dealt with the cart before, footsteps and other noises but not the crying.
For whatever reason, I had a hard time staying there after that. I would get a
really deep sinking feeling in my stomach late at night that felt like
something bad was in the room with me. Anyway, it was a very old two story
house that was probably built in the early 1900's. My mother had told me there
was a child that had passed away from crib death. </big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Was talking ghosts and hauntings with one of my co-workers
last week and it seems that an encounter of mine might have been a haunting. <st1:Street w:st="on"><st1:address w:st="on">Indian Bridge Road</st1:address></st1:Street>
was the road I took to get to and from Matt and Kelly's house when we were
living there. Late one night (we're talking about O-dark-30 here) we were on
our way back from DC. Kier was asleep in the passenger side and I wasn't too
far behind her. I was to the point where I was about to wake her up and have
her talk to me to keep my mind engaged so Mr Brain didn't decide to say
"@#$% it, I'm out of here", punching the clock and heading home on
me. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Hit a particularly dark stretch of the road and a white dog
with reddish eyes tore across the road almost right in front of me. One very
loud F-Bomb (surprised y'all didn't hear it) and a screeching of brakes later
and Kier and I are now walking around the car to see if we hit the dog or not
as neither one of us can remember hearing the sickening thud that means we have
just pounded some poor person's prized puppy into pavement paste. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Sorry, couldn't pass up the alliteration there.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Anyway, no dead dog carcass, no blood, no fur in the grill,
nothing.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Kier remembered seeing the dog as my expletive awoke her in
time to see it disappear in the blind spot right in front of the hood so it
wasn't an image conjured by a overtired mind, there was something. We gather
our nerves and talk for a minute and we figure that (a), it was an albino with
the totally white fur and the pink/red eyes, and (b) that was a damned lucky
mutt that didn't end up as roadkill. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Year and a half later, Dennis my co-worker tells me about
the ghost dog that haunts Indian Head road.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Seems that there are two types of sightings. One, you see
the dog watching from the distance any night accidents (regardless of the
health of the accident victims, scraped knees and bruised ribs are just as
likely to attract it as is a fatality) or two, you see the dog and nothing
happens. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>With my story and the compared notes of others who have seen
the dog, it seems that the likely reason for the type "two" sightings
may indeed be a warning that you are about to prang into something. Certainly
after I almost hit the dog I woke the hell up from adrenaline enough to get
home fully alert. I know I was even awake enough to watch an episode of <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Babylon</st1:place></st1:City> 5 when we got
home. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Certainly makes you wonder. If this encounter with the
paranormal was shrugged off by my wife and I as a mundane "almost running
over a dog" incident, how often do we come across the paranormal and don't
even notice it because the actions of the paranormal entity/incident do not
fall outside of our concept of normal. </big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I am writing to you to clarify the story you have listed on
your web page about the haunting at Salem State College Theater.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am leaving the boys last name out of this
in that this was a horrific event which disturbed the local area for quite some
time and his family is quite possibly still around. Please be mindful that this
boy was a friend, a classmate and playmate to those of us who lived this event
and as you can imagine for a mother to lose her son her little boy in such a
horrifying and unexpected way leaves deep scars, please for the sake of others
be careful what you print! You may post what I have said however, I do not want
my name mentioned and I would hope you&#8217;ll leave this story as plain and simply
tragic it truly was. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Your first version on the story is closest to the truth. It
was 1967 or 68 and the boys name was &#8220;not&#8221; Tommy or Timmy, and he was &#8220;not&#8221; a
teenager his name was Carl and he was about 8 or 9 years old. He was a friend
of mine, we used to eat lunch together everyday at <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Horace</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Mann</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Elementary School</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> on the
Salem State College campus. The short version of the story is that Carl tagged
along with some other kids (I believe some where older than he) to goof around
in the college auditorium after school. They were up above the stage and
seating in the cat walk area and somehow Carl ventured out onto the open ceiling
beyond the cat walk, he was not more than 9 years old and had no way of knowing
that suspended ceiling structure and tiles would not hold his weight. Soon
after venturing beyond that cat walk he fell through and dropped 40 feet onto
the seating, he sustained terrible injuries and died within &#8211;I believe- the
week. The school was in shock and the local community as well from this
horrible tragedy occurring out of something as common as young boys venturing
where they should not have been. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>I don&#8217;t know about Carl haunting the college theater beyond
urban myths and tales, I lived across the street from the theater for 35 years
after the accident and heard nothing. Carl was a &#8220;good kid&#8221; and a friend to
myself and others, he would certainly not harm anyone, nor be malicious in any
way, his personality would be far more inclined to be a kind protective spirit
if it were there.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Hi! I was reading your site about haunted places in <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Kentucky</st1:place></st1:State>, and am amazed
at the detail you all have.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I studied
Supernatural Folklore at <st1:place w:st="on">Western Kentucky</st1:place>, and
you've got your hauntings spot on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I did
have one thing I wanted to mention.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is a listing of a haunting at Helm Library by a student that died
from falling from the 9th floor while opening a window.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Actually, that person was one of the
Librarians.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He fell while I was a
student there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They think he had the
flu, and got hot so tried to open the window, then passed out and fell from the
9th floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An acquaintance of mine was
walking past the library at that time,<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>and actually was hit in the back of the legs by the librarian's
glasses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No one heard him fall, leading
them to believe it had passed out. </big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Anyway, I don't know if you need to make any correction, but
thought I'd let you know.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is creepy
to think about him still being there!</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Also in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:State w:st="on">Kentucky</st1:State></st1:place>...
Around 1915, My great, great uncle boarded with a woman who apparently began
haunting her house after her death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
house was located in Lebanon Junction. There are newspaper articles about the
hauntings, and the house was featured about 25 years ago on a tv show called
"That's Incredible".<span style="">&nbsp; </span></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>at the time my daughter was 3yrs old, and my sister had
miscarried her first baby. my daughter had started talking about a friend she
had by the name of tiffany, when ever something got broke she would say tiffany
did it. at first we all thought itwsa cute, but it started to get out of hand.
things started to break, her toys would be all over the place. we were thinking
she didn't appreciate her toys any more and used hare imaginary friend as an
excuse. one day we noticed she was kinda sad and i asked her what was wrong and
she said tiffany said shae was leaving to go home with her mom soon. of course
we thought she was tired of playing this game. my sis ter had moved back home
because she had a miscarriage and the father of her baby had left because she
lost the baby. she had no idea about this imaginary friend cause it was no big
deal to us, we didn' tell her about it. one night i had just got off from work
and i went straight to my room. i noticed my sister was sitting up in her bed,
she told me to come here. i went to see what she wanted and she said, she had
just seen this pretty little girl dancing arond her bed, now two weeks before
this my daughter told my mom and i that tiffany was dark skinned and had white
burettes all over her head,with a white dress, white shoes and was happy all
the time. well that is the exact same little girl my sister saw dancing around
her bed like a little ballerina. just before she left my sister's room she told
her that her baby is fine and told her to stop crying, the she wasn't there any
more and the i told her about my daughtre's imaginary friend raelizing she
wasn't so imaginary. 2 days later we asked my daughter where is tiffany and she
said she went home with her mommy and then told my sister that her baby is
okay............. is that wierd or what?</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>There is most definitely a presence and evidence of this on
the upper floors of Hull House.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was a
theatre major in <st1:PersonName w:st="on">col</st1:PersonName>lege, and
directed a play on one of the upper floors.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was always very <st1:PersonName w:st="on">col</st1:PersonName>d and
depressing; I used to arrive early and be there by myself for awhile to set up
but after a while, I just would not come in.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There was also the sound of a baby crying.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now, in the play I directed, there was supposed
to be the cries of a baby, but the haunting by the baby would never come on
cue- it always was heard, however.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
will never forget this experience.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
even then, Hull House staff were telling everybody that there is nothing there,
and this is just a story; may be, but something is definitely there, and it is
not a good entity...very dark and threatening.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>My friend and I are artist . Right now we are working in a <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Big</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Mansion</st1:PlaceType>
in <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">California</st1:place></st1:State>.
Some times we have to work at night so we can get into certain area's we can't
access during the day because of all the construction going on. We already new
strange thing were happening in the house like, voices , our names being called
out, radio's and ipods shutting off, stuff flying into the living room like a
piece of a 2 by 4 or a-frame ladder just falling over right in front of us. And
this happened during the day. Anyway this particular night we had to gold leaf
a ceiling in the main hall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And keep in
mind , there is no electricity in the house<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>our<span style="">&nbsp; </span>3 shop lights are run from an
exterior power source. The rest of the house is dark. So after applying the
gold size to the ceiling we had some drying time so we<span style="">&nbsp; </span>decided to take a walk down the dark hall. I
had brought a digital voice recorder so that hopefully we could pick up some of
those voices we had heard. We had one flash light between us .</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>We stopped to talk about a finish another artist had done.
This was in a small hallway off the main hall about 200 feet from were we were
working. All at once we heard a box move in the living room. Like it was picked
up and dropped. So we walked in and I was<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>around<span style="">&nbsp; </span>to turn on the digital
recorder. We walked to over to the fire place in this living room that is very dark
and as I started to place the digital recorder on top of the fire place mantel
, I just turned completly around to face behind me and across the room about 40
ft away from us I saw the most incredible BLACK BLACK figure I've ever seen. It
was so black it looked like it was back lit or something . It also seemed to
have a soft sorta look like black velvet and it also seemed flat .</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Then</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>it move to its left about 25 ft. in a half a second {kinda
like a cartoon} It feels like its looking at us hard but there's no eyes. It
waits again for both of us to acknowledge it, then is moves through<span style="">&nbsp; </span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>a<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>glass door and out
side We didn't fallow it. We were speechless.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>We had to get our work done so we set up the digital
recorder in the living room and<span style="">&nbsp; </span>went
back to finish gold leafing for another 4 hours and believe me the the big
action didn't stop there.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Hi.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I've been
searching around to see if I can find any other experiences like mine, but I
have been unable to find another person or instance of a paranormal experience
at this location.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This past summer, my
family and I were visiting <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Washington</st1:City>,
 <st1:State w:st="on">D.C.</st1:State></st1:place><span style="">&nbsp; </span>We stayed at the Sheraton in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Arlington</st1:City>, <st1:State w:st="on">VA.</st1:State></st1:place><span style="">&nbsp; </span>From the top floor pool, we could see that we
were only a couple blocks from the Pentagon and Arlington National
Cemetary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The hotel, while a very nice
hotel, is not located in the best neighborhood.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I remember reading information from the hotel about being safe and being
sure to lock the door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We always leave
the bathroom light on with the door cracked when we stay at hotels as we have
small children and like to have some light through the night in a strange
place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first night, I was awoken by
a loud hissing sound.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As I looked up, I
saw the image of a man's face crossing the doorway to the bathroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At first, I thought someone had broken into
our room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I firmly told my husband to
get up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He told me he heard it too but
that it was our son breathing loudly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
knew it wasn't and demanded him to wake up again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At this point, I realized it was not an
intruder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I laid back down and heard
tapping on the air conditioner unit to my right.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I then smelled a distinct smell of cigar
smoke.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were in a non-smoking
room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It lasted several seconds, and
then the smell was gone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I then went
back to sleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I truly believe I
experienced a ghost in our room.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Experiences with Some Places on Your Site</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>A friend of mine recently sent me a link to your website
after I shared with her an experience I had in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Dallas</st1:City> <st1:State w:st="on">Texas-</st1:State></st1:place>
after reading your site and discovering I may have had a few more experiences,
she said I should email you to share my stories.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>First off let me begin by stating that I'm originally from
Madison Wisconsin (lived there for 19 years)- and I moved to <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Dallas</st1:City> <st1:State w:st="on">Texas</st1:State></st1:place>
in 2001.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>When I lived in <st1:State w:st="on">Wisconsin</st1:State>,
my family and I used to take yearly trips to Baraboo <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Wisconsin</st1:place></st1:State> to go to a particular apple
orchard. Every year we went I always saw the same man walking along the same
highway and never thought much about it (figured he was a local), I never said
anything about it, other than one time I saw him walking- and a short distance
later I saw him walking again on the same side of the road going the same
direction and instead of thinking this was odd I immediately thought this was
his twin brother- both wearing a military green jacket.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is until I read your site.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That highway happens to be Highway 12 in
Baraboo <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Wisconsin</st1:place></st1:State>
and I think the guy I saw every year happens to be your hitchhiker that
disappears.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Now that I live in <st1:State w:st="on">Texas</st1:State> I
very rarely get back to <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Wisconsin</st1:place></st1:State>,
but I do every once in awhile.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have a
friend who actually lives in Elkmound <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Wisconsin</st1:place></st1:State>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She invited me to come stay with her for a
few days in September 2006.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The day
before I was to return she said she had to take me to this place, because she just
knew I would love it- "you can see all of <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Wisconsin</st1:place></st1:State> from up here", she said.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was another place in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Madison</st1:place></st1:City> that we both enjoyed in High school
much like that, so we got in the car and drove the 2 or 3 miles to this tower
on a hill.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was gorgeous!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You can hear the howling threw the tower,
there's graffitti all over the place...and if you're quiet and still...you can
hear whispering.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was a very eerie
feeling of "not being alone".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I actually started feeling sick when I was there, and by the time we
left this gorgeous tower I began getting violently ill.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So ill in fact that I was sick for a week
with migraines that came with projectile vomiting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I still have migraines to this day that feel
like they did that day...and I had never had a migraine that felt the way they
did that day, prior to being at that place.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After looking on your site, Elkmound <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:State w:st="on">Wisconsin</st1:State></st1:place> is listed with The Overlook
Tower-<span style="">&nbsp; </span>you may want to place a warning,
whether my reaction to this place is evidence or not, that this is very real-
don't go here.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The migraines and
vomiting that happens is so horrible that I don't wish it upon my worst
enemy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It's now October 2007, and I've
had probably over 100 migraines since September 2006, not all have included
vomiting- but seriously- a migraine with stabbing eye pain isn't pleasant by
any means.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I just thought I was sick- if
it was caused by visiting a haunted site, people just need to stear clear- it's
not worth it. (granted the view is insanely beautiful!)</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Now once I moved to <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Texas</st1:place></st1:State>
I found a few friends that shared an interest in the paranormal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I never "saw ghosts".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I always thought I wanted to see ghosts- I
always enjoyed a good horror story, or horror movie.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A particular friend of mine- I'm assuming saw
your website- because we used to venture to many of the places listed on your
site to see "things".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For
example Flag Pole Hill in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Dallas</st1:City>
 <st1:State w:st="on">Texas</st1:State></st1:place>, we went to the exact
location of this supposed street where things get thrown at your car- and
nothing happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(we went nothing short
of 5 times, so it's not like we didn't try...and believe me, we were asking for
it- yes, we were stupid- full moon nights, midnight, halloween night- you name
the stupid cliche, we went.)</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>That's not to say things haven't been productive in the
paranormal department in the DFW area.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My Flag Pole Hill buddy also convinced me to do a late night scavenger
hunt back in 2002 for Smiley's grave in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Garland</st1:City>
 <st1:State w:st="on">Texas</st1:State></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He didn't tell me the whole deal with laying
down on the grave though.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Probably
because he knew I wouldn't do it- he just said that when we got there, he'd
tell me the story.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So we get to the
cemetary in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Garland</st1:City></st1:place>,
and not knowing the exact location of the grave we circle the entire cemetary
which is pretty dark and we had little pen lights as to not attract too much
attention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There's nothing out
there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It's darker than dark- probably
because it's like 11:30 at night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
circling the entire cemetary we don't see anything, so I cut across right up
the middle- which my friend is freaking out, because he doesn't want to
"disturb the dead" (he thinks walking on their graves will wake them
up...more issues than me apparently), and right smack dab in the middle is a
head stone that makes me look at it and it says "smiley"- nothing
strange about it and I go "what's the name we're looking for?" and he
goes "Smiley" (from the edge of the cemetary, because he doesn't want
to come any closer), and I go "found it" and at that time I hear
something walking in front of me at the edge of the cemetary (I figured a cat,
or skunk or something) and I look up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
see a shadow of a guy walking along the edge of the cemetary and I freeze.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I whisper loudly to my friend "who the
f*ck is that?!" and he goes "never mind whose that, where'd that just
come from?" and I look to him, who hasn't moved, and he's pointing behind
me- where about 3 feet or so behind me, there's a lit, burning candle that
hadn't been there when we circled the perimiter before.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I freaked out and ran back to the car.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>On a completely different note the Lady of the Lake at <st1:City w:st="on">Dallas</st1:City>' <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">White</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Rock</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Lake</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>
is still a mystery to me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I used to go
searching for her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I would drive around
White Rock lake like a crazy person, and talk about her to my friends who would
just laugh it off as an urban legend.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, my boyfriend and I were driving around the lake one night, just
to drive and I happened to mention her, because he's lived here his whole life
and I wanted to see which version he knew.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I have no idea if this was her or something completely different or non-paranormal
related, but ahead of us, maybe 300 feet or so was a sharp left curve, to the
right was the lake, straight ahead was a tree and more lake.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were joking about the lady of the lake, I
honestly don't remember what was said, or how it was said- but I do remember it
was in joking form, and all of a sudden the lights turned off on the car, and
the engine quit, causing the car to continue to cost and we couldn't see, about
10 feet before the curve the engine and lights cut back on and we gunned it out
of white rock lake.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We haven't been
back- that was probably last spring...april maybe (2007)</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Anyway.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Those are my
experiences, whether any of them were actual encounters or not, I don't know,
I'm not sure I want to know.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I know
after reading your site, I'm a definite believer, if I wasn't before.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And to be quite honest the Elkmound Wisconsin
posting freaked me out so bad that I had to stop reading, so I didn't get to
read any other Wisconsin postings past that.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I really thought I had just developed some weird allergy all of a sudden
and that's why I had gotten sick.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Me...trying to have a "logical-of this world" explination for
everything.</big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Ok, thanks for reading.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And thanks for taking the time to put up such a great site!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It's very informative and crazy interesting!</big></p>
