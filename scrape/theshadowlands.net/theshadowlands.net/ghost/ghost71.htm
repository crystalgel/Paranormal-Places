<P><B>By: "The Innes's" &lt;innes@soltec.net&gt;</B>
<P><B> When I was in high school, my english teacher told us some stories
about his house.</B>
<P><B> I can't say if it's totally true, but some kids did go over to his
house to check it out.</B>
<P><B>In the 1800's a woman killed herself in his house. She hanged herself
in the hallway.</B>
<P><B> That exact place in the hallway, always stays cold, real cold. yhe
people who visited</B>
<P><B> stood there and said that it was true. The ghost was in love with
the teacher, she would</B>
<P><B> get into bed with him. He said he would actually feel the bed move
when she got into bed,</B>
<P><B> and he could feel her next to him. Now the teacher was married and
the ghost was </B>
<P><B>jealous of his wife. One morning he woke up to find his wifes picture
on the </B>
<P><B>floor. It was in a frame . The glass and the frame were broken, so
he picked it </B>
<P><B>up and noticed scatch marks on the back of his wifes photo, like someone's

</B>
<P><B>fingernails had scratched it, that freaked him out. The other thing
that he noticed was a</B>
<P><B> place in the attic. He had an old attic that they used for storeage.
There was one area </B>
<P><B>that would never get dusty, and things would get moved if you put them

there. He </B>
<P><B>would put things there and they would be moved the next day. The one
thing that </B>
<P><B>would be left alone was an old trunk that was there when they moved
in. It would </B>
<P><B>stay there, but never collect dust. It ended up being the area above
the cold </B>
<P><B>spot in the hallway where she hanged herself.....and thats all I know.

<P>
<P><B>I have already sent in most of my big experiences so I thought I would

share </B>
<P><B>a smaller one.  When I was little about 5 or 6, I had 2 cousins pass
on </B>
<P><B>within a year of each other.  They were brother and sister (I've changed

</B>
<P><B>their names out of respect). Tony and Tamara,  Tony was playing alone
in a </B>
<P><B>car that was running and parked on a slanted driveway,  his father
had gotten </B>
<P><B>out to run up to the house for something he had forgotten. Tony hit
the gear </B>
<P><B>shift and the car started to roll.  He opened the car door and tried
to jump </B>
<P><B>clear, he was only 3, he fell under the wheels and the car rolled over
him.  </B>
<P><B>Tamara his sister was diagnosed with cancer at the tender age of a
year and a </B>
<P><B>half,  she passed on about 9 months after her brother before she was
2 years </B>
<P><B>old. </B>
<P><B>Anyways after their deaths, I used to play with them. (for those who
don't </B>
<P><B>know already) I was raised in an atmosphere where ghosts and the

supernatural </B>
<P><B>were very commonplace. We talked about these things and experienced
them all </B>
<P><B>the time. </B>
<P><B>I had a tire swing in my backyard that would at times swing really
high </B>
<P><B>without the wind blowing or anyone around to push it.  My mother often

</B>
<P><B>commented on why the swing was moving again,  I would look out the
window and </B>
<P><B>tell her "Oh it is just Tony and Tamara playing."  Now this part is
gonna </B>
<P><B>sound like it is right out of Amityville.  But late at night my little

brown </B>
<P><B>rocking chair would start rocking back and forth.  I would wake up
and watch </B>
<P><B>it for a few minutes and then tell Tony and Tamara it was past their

bedtime, </B>
<P><B>lift my blankets and tell them to get in bed with me.  My dad saw me
do this </B>
<P><B>a couple of times and ask me about it.  I told him it was Tony and
Tamara </B>
<P><B>.  I haven't seen them since I was about 10,  I think it was special
 that </B>
<P><B>they found each other in the beyond and came back  to be my playmates
for a </B>
<P><B>few years. I never saw one without the other.  My opinion is that loved

ones </B>
<P><B>will come back to get you when you pass on and if you aren't ready
to go they </B>
<P><B>might stick around awhile with you. What do you think?  Thanks for

listening.</B>

<P>
<P>
<P><B>     It was several months ago... My (now -ex) fiance was at work and

it</B>
<P><B>was about 1:30 pm when I dozed off.  I guess about a half hour later,

I</B>
<P><B>awakened to someone stroking my hair and what sounded like water</B>
<P><B>running. ( ? ) I called out my (ex) fiance's name, thinking he'd come</B>
<P><B>home from work for lunch break.  I asked him a question, though now
I</B>
<P><B>can't remember what I'd asked- and I very well heard a response from

in</B>
<P><B>the bathroom, where the water seemed to be running (full blast).</B>
<P><B>     I remember saying something else, but then I didn't get a

response.</B>
<P><B>By this time, I was more "awake" so I figured maybe I dreamed he came</B>
<P><B>home .  I thought nothing of it until I remembered the stroking of
my</B>
<P><B>hair.  My hair at the time was short so it couldn't have been falling</B>
<P><B>into place to settle on my shoulders or something.  </B>
<P><B>     There wasn't a draft either- I hate air- conditioning because
I</B>
<P><B>get too cold and am unable to sleep well.  Was this really an

experience</B>
<P><B>or was I just dreaming or something?  I've never had "experiences"</B>
<P><B>before.  Besides my dad dieing 14 years ago, this is another reason

why</B>
<P><B>I'm interested in capturing ghosts on film.</B>

</H3><P><B>By: Wocvic@aol.com</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>I have not told many people about the things that happened to me the
weeks </B>
<P><B>after the Okla. City Bombing because in a way it seems I am violating
a trust </B>
<P><B>that was ask of me by spriits or something or someone that needed help.
I have </B>
<P><B>experienced  many things in my life that no one I knew could explain.
I </B>
<P><B>wanted to ask you what you think about what I am about to tell you.
I work </B>
<P><B>downtown Okla. City and have for 25 years. That April morning I was
late to </B>
<P><B>work, I normally get to work by 9:00 AM, that morning I was walking
from my </B>
<P><B>car when it happened I ran for 2 blocks because I thought the building
I was </B>
<P><B>working in was going to fall and it is 37 floors tall. There were many

things </B>
<P><B>that happened to me involving the bombing but the same things happened
to </B>
<P><B>many people that worked downtown and felt violated by this act, as
did many </B>
<P><B>people . I don't believe being downtown at the time of the bombing
has </B>
<P><B>anything to do with the things that followed.. </B>
<P><B>The very next day after the bombing I started seeing people that were
not </B>
<P><B>there when I would look back. I would get in an elevator and step to
the </B>
<P><B>side so I wouldn't step on the person that was standing there. Then
I would </B>
<P><B>turn around to apologize for almost stepping on them and no one was
there. In </B>
<P><B>my office I would see a shadow past my office door when I knew no one
else </B>
<P><B>was in the office so I would get up to investgate and there would be
no one. </B>
<P><B>I heard cries coming from areas of my parking garage when I would be

walking </B>
<P><B>from or to my car, and I would follow the cries and no one was there.
These </B>
<P><B>things would happen to me all day long. One morning in my home as I
was </B>
<P><B>getting ready for work I thought my husband walked to the bathroom
door and </B>
<P><B>looked at me as I was putting on my makeup, then he walked on. I started

</B>
<P><B>talking to him and he didn't answer so I went to the other part of
the house </B>
<P><B>and he was not to be found, so I went to the bedroom and he was asleep
in </B>
<P><B>bed. By this time I  was very upset about this so I sit down in the
living </B>
<P><B>room in my home and called the spirts , or whatever they were. I told
them </B>
<P><B>they must leave me alone. I knew they were trying to find someone to
help </B>
<P><B>them but it was not me. I told them I was very sorry they had been
taken away </B>
<P><B>from their loved ones without being able to say goodby but I could
not help </B>
<P><B>them and please leave me alone.</B>
<P><B>After that it all stopped and I have not seen anything like that

again.</B>

<P>
<P><B>Just a few weeks ago I was getting ready for bed and watching the History

</B>
<P><B>Channel one of my favorites.  Well about 2 am I woke up and felt like

someone </B>
<P><B>was holding me down and I was rather scared.  I keeping thinking I
am </B>
<P><B>dreaming.  So I forced myself to sleep again and I woke up again and
still </B>
<P><B>had the same feeling and could not set up.  So I called on my guardian

angel </B>
<P><B>my grandfather and asked him to make this go away.  And it did.  After
that I </B>
<P><B> awoke very rested for all I have been through.  Thanks to him.</B>
<P>
<P><B>This is not the first time he has come to my aid in these matters.
 I know he </B>
<P><B>is with me always along no with my grandmother.</B>

<H3><A NAME=best><B>My Grandmother, My Best Friend....</B></A>
</H3><P><B>By: Anonymous</B>
<P>
<P><B>When I was 5 my mom and dad bought their first house (back in the early

</B>
<P><B>60's).  There, my mom, dad, myself (youngest, only girl) and two older

</B>
<P><B>brothers, along with my grandmother (my mom's mom) lived.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Six months later my father was killed by a DWI driver.  My mom had
to take </B>
<P><B>over the family business which left my grandmother in complete control
of us </B>
<P><B>kids and the house.  Grandma was my "grandmother, mother, &amp; BEST

FRIEND" all </B>
<P><B>rolled into one."    (Sorry if this is getting a little boring...)</B>
<P>
<P><B>When I was 18 my grandmother had a heart-attack and "I" did CPR on
her.  </B>
<P><B>Little did I know then how much she'd suffer later.  It ended up she
</B>
<P><B>would/DID not speak or move for the next 9 months.  We kept her with
us doing </B>
<P><B>"home care" type of things (feeding her, washing her, etc.) until she

needed </B>
<P><B>total hospitalization.  This lasted approx. 3 weeks (which we did NOT
know at </B>
<P><B>the time but did know she was turning for the worse.)</B>
<P>
<P><B>Anyway, our family did "shifts" to always try to be with her.  On the
day </B>
<P><B>prior to her death (which I did NOT know at that time), I was on my

"shift."  </B>
<P><B>I was there with my boyfriend at the time and "gram"  in a single room.
 We </B>
<P><B>came to visit and I suddenly got extremely aggitated (sp?) and told
my </B>
<P><B>boyfriend, "please go get her some fresh water."  He could not understand

</B>
<P><B>because she already had some!  I INSISTED, PLEASE do this for me, which
he </B>
<P><B>did.  People, keep in mind this woman has not moved, nor SPOKEN for
over 9 </B>
<P><B>months!!   When he left, I totally lost it!  I mean I knew I was losing
my </B>
<P><B>best friend!   Yes, I went off the wall...  I cried, screamed, and
banged my </B>
<P><B>head against the wall screaming "Gramma, I LOVE YOU SO MUCH, PLEASE
DON'T </B>
<P><B>LEAVE ME!!"   The reply......holding my hand.... "Nancy, I LOVE YOU
TOO!!"  I </B>
<P><B>cried and hugged her like I've never hugged anyone in my life.   Soon
after </B>
<P><B>my boyfriend came back and was just flabbergastered by seeing me so
drawn out </B>
<P><B>so soon.</B>
<P>
<P><B>That evening, it was time for my mom, my oldest brother and sister
in-law to </B>
<P><B>be with gram.  My boyfriend &amp; I stayed at my brothers to watch
his kids.  </B>
<P><B>Around 11pm or so (my brother lived in a ground floor apartment at
the time) </B>
<P><B>I just crawled out the window and started to cry and pray.  My boyfriend

was </B>
<P><B>on the couch asleep and woke up.  He was like "what the heck are you
doing </B>
<P><B>out there?"  I just replied "She's gone!"  He asked did you get a phone

call? </B>
<P><B> "No..."  "Well, how do you know?"   "I just KNOW!!!"  Two minutes
later the </B>
<P><B>phone rang.  It was my sister in-law.   "I'm so sorry... gramma just
passed </B>
<P><B>away about 10 minutes ago..."</B>
<P>
<P><B>This was not the end.  When I begged her not to leave.  I guess she
didn't.   </B>
<P><B>I would wake up EVERY morning between 2:00-3:00am and feel a "presence"

</B>
<P><B>there.  (I sleep on my stomach.)  It was NEVER a bad feeling, but I
was </B>
<P><B>always afraid to look (God, wish I did now!!)   This went on for the
next </B>
<P><B>couple of years.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I NEVER spoke about this to anyone until about three years later when
I was </B>
<P><B>visiting my next to older brother down in Texas and we went to a Super
Fest </B>
<P><B>Concert and sat in the parking lot getting into some really heavy </B>
<P><B>conversation (I'm originally from the east coast.)  Anyway, when I
told him </B>
<P><B>about gramma, he kinda went white.   He said "Nancy, I thought *I*
was going </B>
<P><B>crazy because when I lived at mom's house gramma used to come and visit
me </B>
<P><B>too.!"  </B>
<P>
<P><B>Truthfully, I don't think I, or we, ever lost her.  And I pray she's

waiting </B>
<P><B>to greet me when it's my turn too.</B>
<P><B>It automatically made me feel better knowing someone who we love so
much can </B>
<P><B>still love us in return, no matter what...</B>
<P>
<P><B>Sorry this is so long but aside of other "freaky things" that's happened
in </B>
<P><B>my life, I can also say it's one of the only one's that's given me
some kind </B>
<P><B>of "comfort."</B>
<P>
<P><B>Thanks for listening...</B>

<P><B> </B>
<P>
<P><B>IN 1986 my best friend former room-mate named Teresa died a horrible

death.</B>
<P><B>She was stabbed to death by someone and died bleed to death.  I was
so deeply</B>
<P><B>saddened by her death. A couple of months went by and I could feel
her presence</B>
<P><B>with me. I did not scare me. I forgot to say that her funeral was on

Halloween.</B>
<P><B>but any way I would cry because I  felt such a loss and the way she
died, she</B>
<P><B>must of been horrified the last few minutes of her life.  That was
what I was</B>
<P><B>having a hard time with.</B>
<P><B>Then about a year later I would mourn on the day she died, and Halloween

was</B>
<P><B>not fun either. She was always in my thoughts. Then one evening she
came to me</B>
<P><B>when I was asleep, but I remember everything she said to me. She was

wearing</B>
<P><B>her normal clothes she looked the same as the last time we spoke, and
I even</B>
<P><B>asked her questions.  I bet you think that is weird when you are sleep
I was</B>
<P><B>in full control of my thoughts.  I asked who killed her she said that
it was</B>
<P><B>not important and she knew how bad I was feeling and she could not
rest until</B>
<P><B>I stopped mourning. She told me she was fine but she could not be at

peace</B>
<P><B>until I was. I told her okay I will try. It has </B>
<P><B>been 13 yrs. later I have gotten over her death and moved on with my
life. I have</B>
<P><B>not felt her presence anymore and I know she is at peace and has moved
on to a</B>
<P><B>better place.             </B>

<P>
<P><B>I live in a big city called Juarez, it's in the border of </B>
<P><B>Mexico here.  My whole family lives here, so my grandparents had lived
in the same </B>
<P><B>house for years and decided to move to a new house not far from the
old one.  So </B>
<P><B>they moved to the new house, it was beautiful!! I really loved that
house!! So </B>
<P><B>my grandparents don't believe in ghosts, but they say that after this

experience </B>
<P><B>they DO!!...well the house had a second floor where all the bed room
were and at </B>
<P><B>the back yard there was a little bedroom where my greatgrandmother
lives, she </B>
<P><B>swears she saw fire in the middle of the backyard!! In Mexico we have
a thought </B>
<P><B>that if you see fire in a hounted house, it means that theres money
hiding </B>
<P><B>there, so my uncle went to the house, sat on the couch and this trully

</B>
<P><B>amazed me...my uncle said I'm going to bring a man to help me dig and
see </B>
<P><B>if theres really a treasure.... just as he finished talking, one of
the </B>
<P><B>legs of the couch riped and the couch fell to the ground, I was petrefied!!

so </B>
<P><B>was my uncle!!so he decided to leave them alone.but my grandparents
felt a lot of</B>
<P><B> things, like my grandma, she heard all of the windows and doors opening

and closing </B>
<P><B>and as she went down stairs to check it out the noise would stop and
begin upstairs,...an </B>
<P><B>aunt was in the bath room when she heard a male calling her but she
thought it </B>
<P><B>was my grandma who was calling her, so she said in a minute...but </B>
<P><B>then the voice came out stronger and it sounded like if my grandma
had hurt </B>
<P><B>herself so my aunt ran as fast as she could and found my grandma just
fine, she </B>
<P><B>asked if she was ok, and my grandmother laughed but she knew what was
going </B>
<P><B>on!!....soon they moved back to the old house ... </B>

<P>
<P><B>    I should first start with a little bit of a background . I have
been a sound </B>
<P><B>engineer for over 20 years. The first part of my career was spent living

out of </B>
<P><B>suitcases. My old girlfriend at the time, who I had known since high

school, </B>
<P><B>lived in a small bachelor apartment while I was out on the road. We
will call </B>
<P><B>her K. One of the musicians I was working with at the time asked </B>
<P><B>myself K if we wanted to share a house with him and a student </B>
<P><B>friend of his. It was a nice attached home in downtown Toronto. As
I stated </B>
<P><B>earlier K and myself had been together for a long time. I have always

</B>
<P><B>been interested in the para-normal, UFO's and other strange </B>
<P><B>phenomena.K did not have the same interests in these things as I </B>
<P><B>did. In fact she thought it was ridiculous. After living in the house
for a few </B>
<P><B>months I started to hear and feel strange things. One night when I
was out to </B>
<P><B>dinner with K she asked me if I had noticed anything strange </B>
<P><B>happening around the house. I told her that I had and she said  I think
we </B>
<P><B>have a little visitor in the house. This surprised me. She said she
</B>
<P><B>started to notice strange sounds like the front door opening and someone

walking </B>
<P><B>up the hardwood floor and proceed up the stairs to the second floor.
But on </B>
<P><B>investigation there would be no one upstairs. After dinner when we
got home we </B>
<P><B>asked our student roommate M if he had experienced anything strange
</B>
<P><B>in the house. He said he was a little embarrassed to bring it up, but
he had. He </B>
<P><B>too had heard the front door opening and footsteps into the house,
in fact there </B>
<P><B>was a night recently he had heard K and myself leave for the </B>
<P><B>evening, shortly thereafter he heard the front door open and someone

walking up </B>
<P><B>the hallway. He was in the basement and came upstairs thinking that
we had </B>
<P><B>returned . When the got to the top of the basement stairs he tried
to open the </B>
<P><B>door but the door would not open. This door does not have the lock
on </B>
<P><B>it.M first thought that we were playing at joke on him. He said he
</B>
<P><B>called out our names but there was no reply. Then he thought someone
had broken </B>
<P><B>into the house not knowing that he was in the basement. Armed with
a baseball </B>
<P><B>bat M tried the door again. This time the door openned. After </B>
<P><B>walking around the house and finding the front door locked there was
no one </B>
<P><B>there. K also told me that when she had come home after visiting me
</B>
<P><B>in the Quebec City where I was working for Christmas and New years
, that she </B>
<P><B>found all of the towels from the upstairs bathroom were piled in the
middle of </B>
<P><B>the living room floor and no one had been in the house. This was just
the start. </B>
<P><B>At first I thought it was sounds coming from the house next-door. The

person who </B>
<P><B>live next-door was an elderly Chinese gentleman who lived alone. When
I heard </B>
<P><B>the noises during the day I would go next-door to see if the old gentleman

was </B>
<P><B>home. Most of the time he wasn't there, and his floors and stairs were

carpeted. </B>
<P><B>The footsteps seem to come from a younger person walking on hardwood

floors. The </B>
<P><B>sounds would happen day or night. It generally never happend late night

when you </B>
<P><B>might think something might spook you. In fact nothing would happen
for months </B>
<P><B>at a time and then over the course of two or three weeks a bunch of
things would </B>
<P><B>happen. Every once and a while when you are walking upstairs ,you would
get the </B>
<P><B>impression that someone was trying to run past you and beat you to
the top of </B>
<P><B>the stairs. Then we started to notice that quite often while you are

sitting on </B>
<P><B>the main floor, reading or watching television that you would get the

impression </B>
<P><B>that someone was peaking around corner at you. When you looked in their

</B>
<P><B>direction they would duck away. We never felt threatend. It was almost
as if it </B>
<P><B>was playing a game with you. One afternoon around four or 5 p.m. I
was standing </B>
<P><B>in the kitchen talking toK who had just got off work. The stereo was
</B>
<P><B>on in the next room. From corner of my eye I saw a hand come through
the doorway </B>
<P><B>three times. Like someone dancing in the other room. I ignored this

thinking it </B>
<P><B>was one of the roommates joking around . Then it happened again. The
first </B>
<P><B>gesture caught my attention, the second gesture I turned and looked,
the third </B>
<P><B>gesture I focused on a semi transparent hand. The hand looked to be
the hand of </B>
<P><B>a young girl. With one step backwards I could see through the kitchen

doorway </B>
<P><B>and around the main floor of the house. There was no one there. After
a few </B>
<P><B>years K moved out and so did my two other roommates. I then got two
</B>
<P><B>new roommates. J was a university professor. R was a bit </B>
<P><B>of a globe traveler who just needed a place to stay between trips abroad.

One </B>
<P><B>afternoon when R was in town with his girlfriend Y ,I </B>
<P><B>was walking up the stairs to the bathroom on the second floor to get
ready to go </B>
<P><B>to work. When I got to the top of the stairs the hallway was dark because

the </B>
<P><B>three bedroom doors were all close , the only light was coming through
the </B>
<P><B>bathroom window into the hallway. I saw the silhouette of a woman or
girl </B>
<P><B>walking out of the bathroom. Thinking it was Y I asked her if she </B>
<P><B>needed to use the bathroom because I needed it to get ready for work.
The image </B>
<P><B>came out of the bathroom turned and walked up the hallway and dissipated.

At </B>
<P><B>this point Y opened the bedroom door and asked me if I was talking
</B>
<P><B>to her. I did not want to alarm her at what I had just witnessed. So
I said to </B>
<P><B>her I just wanted to know if she needed to use the bathroom because
I needed to </B>
<P><B>get ready for work. She said no thank you and turned that went back
into the </B>
<P><B>bedroom. At this point in time with having three bachelor guys under
one roof we </B>
<P><B>did a lot of entertaining. In fact it was R who nicknamed the entity
</B>
<P><B>or spirit  Margaret. Sometimes when we would have guests over </B>
<P><B>watching television or playing cards Margaret would start acting </B>
<P><B>up.R would look at me to say don't say anything . Guests would ask
</B>
<P><B>us what the noise was coming from and we would just say next-door.
Then one day </B>
<P><B>we had a Sunday brunch with friends and colleagues that we all worked
with. As </B>
<P><B>the evening progressed R and myself felt that some of our guests had
</B>
<P><B>a little too much to drink so if we knew they were driving we would
hide their </B>
<P><B>car keys. Some of the guests slept over. The next morning R and </B>
<P><B>myself were up early to head off to work, one of the guests had just
woken up. </B>
<P><B>We told her that there was a fresh pot of coffee on and when her boyfriend

woke </B>
<P><B>up they could leave at their leisure and just make sure the front door
got </B>
<P><B>locked. The young woman went into the kitchen ,got herself a cup of
coffee ,and </B>
<P><B>started to clean up the dishes from the day before. At this point she

noticed </B>
<P><B>the little hand waving at her through the kitchen door. She was absolutely

</B>
<P><B>terrified. After backing her way around the kitchen to see through
the kitchen </B>
<P><B>doorway she saw no one there. She then ran to the front room to wake-up
her </B>
<P><B>boyfriend who was asleep on the coach. He thought by her reaction that

something </B>
<P><B>terrible had happened in the middle of the night . She wanted to leave
the house </B>
<P><B>immediately but her boyfriend said he had to use the bathroom first.
She would </B>
<P><B>not let him close the bathroom door. I later saw this woman that evening

and she </B>
<P><B>was furious with me that I had not told her about Margaret. One summer

morning I </B>
<P><B>had been sleeping with a new girlfriend in the guest bedroom in the

basement </B>
<P><B>where it was nice and cool. My girlfriend got out of bed and went up
to the </B>
<P><B>kitchen to get something to drink. She immediately came back downstairs
and woke </B>
<P><B>me up, asking me if my other roommates J always got up first thing
</B>
<P><B>in the morning and smoked pot in the living room. This surprise me
because I </B>
<P><B>knew J did not smoke at all and he was in bed with the flu. I ran </B>
<P><B>upstairs to see who was in the house. There was no one in the living
room and I </B>
<P><B>could not smell pot. I went back downstairs and asked my girlfriend
what she had </B>
<P><B>seen. She said she did not get a good look at who ever it was because
she was </B>
<P><B>only wearing a T-shirt and she was embarrassed. She said the person
was of </B>
<P><B>slender build and had long hair and she could smell pot. Things seemed
to quiet </B>
<P><B>down for while and then one evening I was standing in the front hallway
by the </B>
<P><B>front door talking to a cinematographer friend of mine about a music
video that </B>
<P><B>we were about to work together on. Then we both heard a women's voice
say </B>
<P><B>Ian ,like someone was trying to get my attention. My friend turned
</B>
<P><B>to me and said I'll let you go, talk to you tomorrow ,and left. I then

walked </B>
<P><B>through to the kitchen to where R and his girlfriend were at the </B>
<P><B>table working on their taxes. I asked them if they had called me. They
said they </B>
<P><B>had not said a word. I then called my friend on his cell phone and
asked him if </B>
<P><B>he had heard someone called my name, he said yes. I had asked the landlord

about </B>
<P><B>the history of the house and he told me that he had lived in the house
for a </B>
<P><B>longtime before us. I asked him if anything strange had happened to
him while he </B>
<P><B>lived in the house. He laughed and said no. He eventually asked me
if I wanted </B>
<P><B>to buy the house, because he was going to sell it. R and myself </B>
<P><B>discussed the idea but decided the timing was bad because he was going
to </B>
<P><B>Australia and I was going on a six-week tour in Europe. I lived in
that house </B>
<P><B>for eight years so moving was a real pain. It's surprising how much
stuff you </B>
<P><B>can collect. My girlfriend ,who is now my wife,and I were moving in

together to </B>
<P><B>a new house. Her sister offered to give us a hand in moving. She had
never been </B>
<P><B>in the house and did not know it's history. She was not in the house
for more </B>
<P><B>than a minute before she walked into the kitchen, turnaround, looking
quite </B>
<P><B>startled and said Who is the girl I just saw in the kitchen ? She </B>
<P><B>left the house immediately. On the very last night I was in the house

moving out </B>
<P><B>the last odds and ends by myself, Margaret really started acting up.
</B>
<P><B>I was dying to call some of my more skeptical friends to come over
and give me </B>
<P><B>at hand. You could hear her banging around upstairs and when I was
outside, </B>
<P><B>she'd peak through the windows at me and then duck away. After I had
the van all </B>
<P><B>packed up I walked around the house talking out loud to Margaret telling

her </B>
<P><B>that I was leaving and she should leave to, because everything must
move on. </B>

<H3><A NAME=was><B>What Was It??</B></A>
</H3><P><B>By: jrose@commlinks.com</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>I have experienced a few minor incidents on occasion that have caused
me to</B>
<P><B>think "hmm...that was odd" But, the story I am about to relay is to

date</B>
<P><B>the only "major" incident I have ever experienced. I'm going to tell

you</B>
<P><B>exactly, step-by-step what I remember happening. And, let me say this

at</B>
<P><B>the outset, I don't know what this was, but I sincerely hope nothing

like</B>
<P><B>it ever happens again. Anyway, here goes:</B>
<P>
<P><B>About 12 years ago, I was living with my parents in Goodyear, Ariz.
It was</B>
<P><B>springtime and I was taking a few classes at a local community

college.</B>
<P><B>(hadn't made the jump to the university yet). We had lived in the

house</B>
<P><B>since I was 7 (I was 20 at the time), and nothing much had happend
to this</B>
<P><B>point. (I'll tack on some of the minor stuff at the end of this

story)</B>
<P><B>However, one night during the spring I woke from a strange nightmare.

I</B>
<P><B>wasn't anything I could remember vividly, just a scared feeling that</B>
<P><B>someone "bad" had been talking to me. I remember saying the 43rd Psalm

to</B>
<P><B>myself and waking up. Anyway, I decided to go into the kitchen to get

a</B>
<P><B>drink of water. When I got to the kitchen, my mother was sitting at

the</B>
<P><B>table by herself in the dark. I asked her what she was doing. She said

she</B>
<P><B>couldn't sleep and that she had had a strange nightmare. Something
about a</B>
<P><B>"monster" trying to get in the house. I don't remember what exactly

happend</B>
<P><B>next. I think I made some joke about it and went back to bed.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The next morning, I was getting ready for school and my mom was going
to go</B>
<P><B>shopping with my grandmother. I remember I was bent over tying my

shoe,</B>
<P><B>when suddenly the cats in our garage began screaming (We had a mother

cat</B>
<P><B>and five or six babies which we kept in the garage overnight) But,
not only</B>
<P><B>were they screaming but I remember hearing thing bang off the wall

hard</B>
<P><B>enough to shake items on our living room shelves and clank on the

concrete</B>
<P><B>floor like someone was throwing stuff around. </B>
<P>
<P><B>I looked up at my mother and she was looked at me. We were both

puzzled</B>
<P><B>because the outside garage door was shut and locked and no one was
home but</B>
<P><B>the two of us. (My father leaves for work at 5 a.m. It was now about

8</B>
<P><B>a.m.)</B>
<P>
<P><B>As quick as I could I ran to the door leading from the living room
into the</B>
<P><B>garage and opened it. When I did, all of the cats rushed past me as
fast as</B>
<P><B>they could into the house. I stood there staring into what looked like

an</B>
<P><B>empty garage, but suddently -- I'm not kidding you -- something started

</B>
<P><B>howling. It was a long, loud sound like someone blowing a

medim-pitched</B>
<P><B>note on a claranet or something. The sound faded away in just a second

or</B>
<P><B>two. I said "what the h??? was that? My mother just shook her head.
</B>
<P>
<P><B>The only thing that popped into my mind was that some type of animal
-- a</B>
<P><B>rabbit or gopher or something -- had somehow gotten into the garage

and</B>
<P><B>that the cats had hurt it. I told my mom to hold the door and I would

go</B>
<P><B>see if I could find it. I looked around as good as I could but could

find</B>
<P><B>nothing. No fur. No blood. Nothing. Then my mother said "Come here

quick</B>
<P><B>and look at the cats."</B>
<P>
<P><B>I walked back into the house and all of the cats were gathered in the</B>
<P><B>hallway. The kittens were bunched around the mother, and she was

following</B>
<P><B>something in the air above her with her eyes and hissing at it. She

was</B>
<P><B>even swatting at the sky with her paws. Suddenly, one of the baby

kittens</B>
<P><B>started kicking and spinning on the ground crying. The mother cat

pounced</B>
<P><B>on the baby and started biting it like she wanted to kill it. I pulled

the</B>
<P><B>mother cat off and literally threw her into my bedroom and at the same

time</B>
<P><B>I threw the baby into the hall bathroom and closed the door.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The remaining baby cats  ran into my room after the mother. But as
soon as</B>
<P><B>they got in there, they all turned and ran out, including the mother

cat,</B>
<P><B>And, all of them hid in the living room. </B>
<P>
<P><B>My mother was scared and said she had had enough. She demanded that
I take</B>
<P><B>her to my grandmothers right away. That sounded like a pretty damned

good</B>
<P><B>idea to me too. And we practically fell over each other getting down

the</B>
<P><B>hall way into the kitchen to get my car keys. </B>
<P>
<P><B>While I was rumaging through our "junk drawer" to get my keys, my

mother</B>
<P><B>went to the kitchen phone to call my grandmother to let her know she

was</B>
<P><B>coming early. The distance between the drawer and the phone was about
8 to</B>
<P><B>10 feet. Suddenly, my mother turned to me and said "That's not funny!"

I</B>
<P><B>asked her what she was talking about and she accused my of breathing

loudly</B>
<P><B>in her ear and then chuckling. I said it wasn't me, and asked how she</B>
<P><B>thought I could do that from across the room. But, just as I got my

words</B>
<P><B>out -- no joke -- someone did the same thing to me. It felt like they

were</B>
<P><B>standing behind my right shoulder. Only this time my mom heard it too.

</B>
<P><B>Okay, I'm not ashamed to say I ran. Like a little kid I ran straight
to the</B>
<P><B>car and started it. In fact, I was mad that I had to wait for my mom

to</B>
<P><B>catch up.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I drove to my grandmother's house (about 1.5 miles from our home) and

I</B>
<P><B>started feeling a little silly. I mean here I was a 20 year old man

running</B>
<P><B>out of his own home because he was scared. So, I left my mother at
my</B>
<P><B>grandmothers and went home by myself. (there was no way she was going</B>
<P><B>back.) When I got there everything was quiet. The cats were no where
to be</B>
<P><B>found. So I turned on the television set and sat down. I started

watching</B>
<P><B>some inane daytime program when I remembered the baby cat in the bathroom.

</B>
<P>
<P><B>Curious as to what happend and still thinking that some "animal" had

caused</B>
<P><B>all the ruckus, I opened the door to the bathroom. The kitten was lying

on</B>
<P><B>the floor soaking wet. The entire room smelled like sh*t. But there
was no</B>
<P><B>excrement anywhere. I grabbed a towel, picked up the kitten with it

and</B>
<P><B>began looking it over for bite marks or cuts of any kind. Couldn't

find</B>
<P><B>anyting. So I wrapped the cat in the towel and took it into the living

room</B>
<P><B>with me. After we sat down, the other baby cats started coming out
of their</B>
<P><B>hiding places one by one and gathered around me. For the rest of the

day,</B>
<P><B>the cats were at my heels. If I got up to get a drink they would

litterally</B>
<P><B>following me so closely that I had to shuffle my feet to avoid

tripping</B>
<P><B>over them.</B>
<P>
<P><B>That's it. nothing else happend. I called my mom said that the coast

was</B>
<P><B>clear and she came home.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>Again, I don't know what happend that day. I don't make any pretenses

to</B>
<P><B>being a psychic or a "sensitive." I don't go for New Age philosphy
or</B>
<P><B>religion. Heck, I'm a registered Republican for crying out loud (don't

hold</B>
<P><B>it against me).  But, I do know what I heard and saw that day. And,
I know</B>
<P><B>I dont' want anything like it to happen again. I don't think it was
fun or</B>
<P><B>interesting or anything of the sort. If any of you have an idea about

what</B>
<P><B>it might have been -- particularly if you have "rational" explanation

--</B>
<P><B>I'd love to hear it. Thanks.</B>
<P>
<P><B>BTW -- Since this is soooo long, I will post the minor events

separately.</B>
<P>
<P><B>What Was It???Pt.2</B>
<P>
<P><B>By: jrose@commlinks.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>My story, part 1 relates the only "major unexplained incident" I have

ever</B>
<P><B>encountered. It happend at our home in Goodyear, Arizona.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Below is a list of some of the "minor" incidents that happend in that

house</B>
<P><B>and our community. Although I can't explain the "major" incident at
all. I</B>
<P><B>have tried to include rational explanations for these minor events
where I</B>
<P><B>can.</B>
<P>
<P><B>My first "incident" could have been a dream -- doesn't seem like it
to me,</B>
<P><B>but it could have.  We lived in a very old (for Arizona) house in

Goodyear.</B>
<P><B>I was about 5. My parents sent me to bed. They were awake in the

living</B>
<P><B>room. I was afraid of the dark so my mom let me go to sleep with the

light</B>
<P><B>on. Well, I was in my bed and trying to go to sleep. But, I was scared

and</B>
<P><B>didn't want to be alone. All of a sudden I got this urge to look up.
So I</B>
<P><B>turned my head and looked at the foot of my bed. Sitting there as plain

as</B>
<P><B>could be was a "blue woman." She looked a little older than my mother.

She</B>
<P><B>was thin and had short neat hair. She was smiling at me and she had

one</B>
<P><B>hand resting on my leg. Thinking about it, she looked almost like an

"old</B>
<P><B>movie," but more bluish than gray. Anyway, I remember looking at her
for a</B>
<P><B>second -- long enough I can still clearly remember the details of what

she</B>
<P><B>looked like -- then I closed my eyes hard and opened them. She was

gone.</B>
<P><B>Needless to say, I screamed for my mother and spent that night in her

bed.</B>
<P><B>Like I said, maybe it was a dream. I don't know. It was strange

though.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Shortly after that we moved into another house. We had it built brand

new.</B>
<P><B>At night I would hear someone walking in the living room, and I would

call</B>
<P><B>my dad to see who it was. Nobody was ever there. Sometimes I would
also see</B>
<P><B>"shadows" moving down the hall. My mom would always tell me that I
was just</B>
<P><B>seeing my father and her checking in on us kids, but later she told
me that</B>
<P><B>she only said that to not scare me. In fact, we only lived in that

brand</B>
<P><B>new house about 14 months. Before moving just down the street to

another</B>
<P><B>brand new one. A big reason for the move, I found out later, is that

my</B>
<P><B>mother would often see a shadow or shadows of "little kids" moving

around</B>
<P><B>the house. I do remember occassions when she would say stuff like

"Jerry,</B>
<P><B>stop standing on the couch." when I would be down the hall in my

bedroom.</B>
<P><B>She always seemed shocked when I answered from the other room. </B>
<P>
<P><B>After moving from the house mentioned above, we moved into the house</B>
<P><B>featured in Part 1. It was just down the street and around the corner

from</B>
<P><B>the previous house. And, it too was a "new construction," no previous</B>
<P><B>occupants. I HATED this house. I actually cried when we moved in. I

don't</B>
<P><B>know why. I was 7. You don't really need reasons when you're 7, do
you? L</B>
<P><B>Anyway, few of "minor" things in addition to the one "major" happend

here.</B>
<P><B>But, mostly it was simply feelings. I wouldn't sit in that house

alone.</B>
<P><B>Whenever my mom and sisters wanted to go somewhere I didn't -- even
as a</B>
<P><B>teenager -- I would spend the whole time they were away across the

street</B>
<P><B>at the park or at a friends house. It just made my skin crawl to be

there</B>
<P><B>alone. I remember once when I was in high school, I went into my

parents</B>
<P><B>bathroom to take a shower. I remember turning on the water. The next

thing</B>
<P><B>I knew I woke up on the floor. The room was full of steam. I was naked

and</B>
<P><B>had a towel draped across my lap. My fist thought was I better get
in the</B>
<P><B>shower before I'm late for school, but when I brushed my hand through

my</B>
<P><B>hair it was soaking wet and the shower water had been turned off.

Another</B>
<P><B>time (I was 14), a gopher litterally chased me to my front door. I
was on</B>
<P><B>the front step waiting for some friends to pick me up. I heard a sound

in</B>
<P><B>the bushes and suddenly this thing -- a large gopher -- comes running

out</B>
<P><B>at me. It was quite a distance from me (maybe 10 feet) I jumped back

inside</B>
<P><B>and slammed the door. My dad asked me what was the matter and I told

him.</B>
<P><B>He did believe me so he went to look and there on our doorstep was

this</B>
<P><B>gopher spinning in circles just like the baby cat in part 1 would do
a few</B>
<P><B>years later. I grabbed my pellet rifle and put about six into him before

he</B>
<P><B>died. Finally, and this was the strangest, aside from the story in
part 1,</B>
<P><B>my girlfriend spent the night one night. Not with me. Just at my house.

We</B>
<P><B>were about 18. I slept in my bedroom and she slept in my parents room.

My</B>
<P><B>parents slept in the living room. Well, the next morning, she came
into my</B>
<P><B>room and asked me what I was doing last night. I said "sleeping," what

are</B>
<P><B>you talking about. She thought I was kidding her and told me to stop</B>
<P><B>messing around. I told her I had no idea what she was talking about.</B>
<P><B>Finally, she told me that when she woke up, her pajama's </B>
<P><B>were folded neatly and lying beside her pillow and that she was nude

from</B>
<P><B>the waist down. I told her maybe she did it in her sleep. But, she

said</B>
<P><B>"why would I fold them up so neatly and lay them by my pillow." I asked

her</B>
<P><B>why would anyone do that. We had no answer.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>Luckily since moving from there when I was in college, I've had no

further</B>
<P><B>experiences, and I DON'T WANT ANY EITHER. If you've got questions or</B>
<P><B>comments drop me a note. Thanks.</B>

<P>
<P>
<P><B>When I was about six years old we lived in a two family house and up</B>
<P><B>stairs lived a old women named margert and I was so scaerd of her you</B>
<P><B>could just say her name and I would run in fear. </B>
<P><B>But she never harmed me or any thing like that it was just everything</B>
<P><B>about her that scared  me. Her name, her clothes, everything. When
we were at</B>
<P><B>supper I was always told to go get her, cus my mom would always give

her</B>
<P><B>something to eat, and here she would come down the stairs in her rags

of</B>
<P><B>of clothing, and her smell of bad odors and her little tv dinner tray

she</B>
<P><B>kept to eat out of. Every time I would run and hide under my dad and

hold</B>
<P><B>onto his legs but then one day while sitting outside  with  my mother</B>
<P><B>and her friend, these women came to take margert to bingo </B>
<P><B>and  I ran over to her and said to margert dont go with them they

won't</B>
<P><B>bring you back.  She just smiled at me so big in disbeleif and hugged</B>
<P><B>me so tight and said it will be ok I'll be back you'll see and I kept</B>
<P><B>begging for her not to go.  The two other women kept trying to get
me</B>
<P><B>to go away and the one women  gave me a quarter to leave them alone.

Well</B>
<P><B>then they left and margert did not come back she had a heart attack,

 and</B>
<P><B>they pulled into a gas staion where she then died. That summer we had

the</B>
<P><B>whole house rented to us and my dad cleaned her apt. out he took out</B>
<P><B>sixteen garbage bags out and clean up the whole place. You could

always</B>
<P><B>hear noises from the upstairs when no one was even up there and every</B>
<P><B>day around supper time you could hear foot steps coming down the stairs.

I</B>
<P><B>have a friend that lives in the building now and say's that things

like</B>
<P><B>that still go on  even before I said a word about it. He did not even
know I</B>
<P><B>even lived there so I know he was tellng the truth. </B>

<P>
<P><B>About four or five years ago I lived with my parents in an old Savannah

</B>
<P><B>Georgia estate type house.  I was nine at the time and was constantly
being </B>
<P><B>frightened by the place, so at night, I would sneak into my parents
room and </B>
<P><B>sleep there (for protection).  On a number of occasions, as I was sneaking,

I </B>
<P><B>would look into the Family Room.  As I looked out onto the Family Room,
I </B>
<P><B>would see a man watching TV (actually turned on), he would look up,
wave </B>
<P><B>hello, and go back to watch TV.  I would then run hysterically, amazingly

not </B>
<P><B>screaming for fear of waking parents, into their room and hide under
the </B>
<P><B>sheets.  Just to let you know, it was only us three, and they were
both there </B>
<P><B>all the time.  After the fact, I realized that my baby-sitter had known
the </B>
<P><B>old residents.  When I asked her if she had any information on the

haunting, </B>
<P><B>she said that the reason the old resident moved out was because of
the loss </B>
<P><B>of her husband to a heart attack that had happened in THAT ROOM!  I
was </B>
<P><B>petrified at this information, and immediately started closing and
locking my </B>
<P><B>door to my room every night.</B>

<P><B>dreamhouse to me.  I had a cat that I would die for and plenty of woods
in </B>
<P><B>the back.  Things soon got creepy though. I was in the bathroom one
day when </B>
<P><B>the lights went out. I saw a hunchback figure run across the room very

</B>
<P><B>fast.(The room was too small to run that fast.)</B>
<P><B>	My next experience was when I was asleep in my grandmothers room.
 </B>
<P><B>They had a very large closet.  I looked up and saw a figure look out
from </B>
<P><B>behind one of the doors at me and then it retreated back in. I ran
into the </B>
<P><B>living room as fast as I could screaming at the top of my lungs.</B>
<P><B>	I am not the only one in my family to see ghosts. When my mother was

</B>
<P><B>young, she and her family had repeated experiences.  She sometimes
saw an 18 </B>

and her </B>
<P><B>parents woke up to someone banging on the back door and screaming.
 My </B>
<P><B>grandfather went to get his gun and shouted profanities at whoever
was doing </B>
<P><B>it.  He opened the door and looked out the screen door only to see
nothing.  </B>

</H3><P><B>By: ZEBAT24@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>	I happened across the Shadowlands by chance and found it quite </B>
<P><B>interesting. After reading many of the articles contained within I
decided to </B>
<P><B>submit my own story to your web site. (One of them anyway)</B>
<P><B>	It happened in Baumholder, Germany in the late 1970's where my father

</B>
<P><B>was stationed with the Army. We lived in a small community that was

comprised </B>
<P><B>of several large apartment type buildings. My parents and a few other

adults </B>
<P><B>got together and purchased what was at the time a novelty type item
called a </B>
<P><B>"spookbox" I think it was. This sound activated tape recorder was placed
in </B>
<P><B>the attic of our building and left for 24 hours. The next day the box
was </B>
<P><B>brought down to our appartment where everyone gathered for a social
in which </B>
<P><B>the parents would playback the recording and see what was on it. My
older </B>
<P><B>sister and I who were still in the single digit age range at the time
were </B>
<P><B>listening to a tape recording of Elvis songs my parents owned. My mother

</B>
<P><B>entered the living romm and told us to go watch TV because they were
taking </B>
<P><B>the tape player. At the point where my mother stopped the tape to remove
it </B>
<P><B>and replace it with the attic recording, the Elvis tape no longer contained

</B>
<P><B>the music we were listening to. From that point on there is only a
blank tape </B>
<P><B>with a little static here and there. The tape was merely stopped and

removed. </B>
<P><B>If anything the tape should only have been damaged at the point where
the </B>
<P><B>tape was stopped. </B>
<P><B>	I do not know the whereabouts of either tape but to this day my </B>
<P><B>parents will not disclose to my sister and I what they heard on the
attic </B>
<P><B>recording. I wish I could tell you more about it though.</B>
<P><B>	I'm sure you receive many of these stories daily and will probably
</B>
<P><B>just chock it up to just that, a ghost story but as I said I have others

that </B>
<P><B>surround my mother that still give me goose bumps. </B>

</H3><P><B>By: Afraditie@webtv.net (Mallory House)</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P>
<P><B>I myself have had some very spooky things happen to me. About a year

ago</B>
<P><B>I was living in a trailer park and we were getting ready to move. I</B>
<P><B>lived in that house for seven years and nothing strange had ever

happened</B>
<P><B>until a week before we were moving. My brother and I were sitting in

my</B>
<P><B>room telling each other stuff when my mom started yeling our names

like</B>
<P><B>we had done something wrong we went out there to see what she wanted

and</B>
<P><B>she exclaimed "Stop throwing stuff!!!" when we were in my room the</B>
<P><B>entire time. She told us to go back in my room when just minutes past

and</B>
<P><B>she started yelling again. We went out there and there were books

lieing</B>
<P><B>on the other side of the room. We told her we were in my room the

entire</B>
<P><B>time and  that we didn't touch anything.  She went to pick the books

 up</B>
<P><B>when someone slapped my moms butt and she fell over.  A few days later

</B>
<P><B>we were sitting in the family room talking with my sister and the

vacuum</B>
<P><B>cleaner started up. It was really weird. </B>
<P>
<P><B>           Ghosts aren't always people. My uncle had a dog that he

was</B>
<P><B>very attached to in '93. But he got very sick and had to put him to</B>
<P><B>sleep. He was very sad. Not a month later he was stopped at a street</B>
<P><B>light and was the only one on the road. When the light turned green

he</B>
<P><B>stopped suddenly to see his dog run in front of him! Surprised he

jumped</B>
<P><B>out of his car and ran after him. But the dog turned a corner and he

was</B>
<P><B>nowhere to be found . My uncle raced back to his car, and before his</B>
<P><B>very eyes his car went up in smoke. He prayed to god to thank  his</B>
<P><B>dog that saved his life. A few years later, he saw the dog again but

it</B>
<P><B>was when he was at work. He worked at a bakery. The dog was sitting

next</B>
<P><B>to the door and was whining like he wanted in  then as my uncle went</B>
<P><B>toward the door the dog started to bark and growl. He turned around

to</B>
<P><B>find a man dressed in black about to hit him with a crowbar and rob

the</B>
<P><B>store. My uncle managed to keep him down and called the police since

then</B>
<P><B>he hasn't seen the dog.</B>
<P><B> </B>
<P><B>                    My aunt has seen animal ghosts too.   When she

was</B>
<P><B>about seventeen her and my family lived in  Harrisberg SD. where

there</B>
<P><B>isn't a cemetary far from. Her and her friend were drunk and they

were</B>
<P><B>at the park. They just sat there for a little bit and started to

sober</B>
<P><B>up when some of their friends came speeding into the parking lot.

 They</B>
<P><B>started to wave for them to come over  and when they did their

friends</B>
<P><B>said that there was some weird light in the cemetary. So my aunt

jumped</B>
<P><B>in the car with her friend and went to the cemetary . When they got</B>
<P><B>there they parked the car and went in quietly. When they went in the</B>
<P><B>gates they were startled by a bareback white horse tied to a fence
in</B>
<P><B>the ditch. They went ahead more and found a lantern along with some</B>
<P><B>gypsy cards. When they went in there was a weird</B>
<P><B>kind of flashlight  light in the trees. I was moving very fast and
it was</B>
<P><B>moving from one side of the cemetary to the other. They stood there

for</B>
<P><B>about 5 min. (which is an unusual time for a ghost) and then they got</B>
<P><B>spooked and left. I have many other stories so feel free to write to
me at</B>

<P><B>I now am 12 years old and when I first heard this story I was 8. I</B>
<P><B>thought it was just a story to keep me interested, but it wasn't.

About</B>
<P><B>a year after the story was told to me, a book came out about this.

Here</B>
<P><B>is the story of it:</B>
<P>
<P><B>     I live about 5 minutes away from this house. They believe that

the</B>
<P><B>man that owned the house 1st, Charlie Apple, had died but loved his</B>
<P><B>house so much he didn't want to leave. Things that gave away a ghost</B>
<P><B>being in the presence were closet doors open in the morning when

there</B>
<P><B>were 2 locks on it, creaking floors, windows open, sudden cold spots,</B>
<P><B>strange pictures, and disturbing noises in the night. Charlie Apple</B>
<P><B>drove the 2nd family living in that house away, what will happen to

the</B>
<P><B>one living there now? The boy says his friends are even afraid to go</B>
<P><B>into his house. Also, if you've ever seen this house (which I have

many</B>
<P><B>times), it is the creepiest house i have ever seen!!	</B>

<P>
<P>
<P><B>  Hi my name is Martin, I'm Austrian. I have a story to tell which
I </B>
<P><B>will never forget and was probably the most terrifying experience I've

</B>
<P><B>ever had in my whole life. This happened about a year ago and never
</B>
<P><B>happened again after that one incident. </B>
<P><B>  My grandmother owns this house that has been passed down from </B>
<P><B>generation to generation, its about 200 years old and the amazing thing

</B>
<P><B>is it still stands!! Well anyway, for summer vacation I usually go
to </B>
<P><B>visit her and I always get to stay in the top floor. One night my </B>
<P><B>grandmother was out at a restaurant with some of her old friends, I
</B>
<P><B>decided to stay home. I started watching T.V.(downstairs) when I heard

</B>
<P><B>the water start running from the sink upstairs, it was really loud.
I </B>
<P><B>was really tired and I thought I was out of my imagination, but about
2 </B>
<P><B>minutes later my radio started playing. I decided to go up, which I
did, </B>
<P><B>when I reached the last few stairs, I fell, I had the feeling something

</B>
<P><B>pushed me down and didn't want me to go up, but eventually I did get
up. </B>
<P><B>When I walked to my room I also had the feeling that something was
</B>
<P><B>watching me and also following me. I also felt so cold suddenly, it
felt </B>
<P><B>like the wind was blowing even though the windows weren't open. This
is </B>
<P><B>part was when my spirit practically jumped out of my body. I walked
into </B>
<P><B>my room and I was pushed on the floor, it felt like cold hands on my
</B>
<P><B>back. Once I fell, the door opened and closed about 5 times and on
the </B>
<P><B>last time the glass in the door shattered and I heard the most evil
</B>
<P><B>laugh in my life. I was so frightend that I just got up and practically

</B>
<P><B>tumbled down the stairs and ran out of the house and waited on the
</B>
<P><B>sidewalk until my grandmother arrived.</B>
<P><B>   I told her this story and amazingly, she believed me because she
said </B>
<P><B>she had a similar experience though less rougher. She said that two
men </B>
<P><B>were once murdered on the top floor and the murderer himself commited

</B>
<P><B>suicide at the same time. </B>
<P><B>  After that incident occured it never happened again and I've went
back </B>
<P><B>to my grandmother and stayed in the same room as the incident occured,

</B>
<P><B>but nothing happened.</B>
<P><B>  I came along your site one day and thought I'd share my story. If
you </B>
<P><B>don't believe it, well I guess I can't really prove it, but I now it
was </B>
<P><B>real. Thanks for listening. If you have any questions just email at

<P><B>Dallas, Tx.</B>
<P><B>	</B>
<P><B>Hello my name is Laila and Iam 18 years old, I am going to tell you
of an </B>
<P><B>experience that happened this year to me and 4 of my friends.  One
night my </B>
<P><B>boyfriend and 3 of my friends were sitting around telling ghost stories,

when </B>
<P><B>my boyfriend happened to mention that he knew of a story about Grapevine

</B>
<P><B>Lake, which is not very far from my house, He continued to tell the
stroy of </B>
<P><B>the man who shot and killed his wife and son and then turned the gun
onto </B>
<P><B>himself. He said that if you put out baby powder on your car (to see
the </B>
<P><B>handprints) go and park your car in front of there old house, which
is now </B>
<P><B>torn down and all that remains is the chimney, and turn off you car
and </B>
<P><B>lights the ghost of the family will push your car away. So of course
being as </B>
<P><B>bored as we were we all jumped into my car and headed out there. I
don't think </B>
<P><B>I ever really thought anything was going to happen, it was just something

to </B>
<P><B>do. We parked in front of there house settlement, which is right next
to the </B>
<P><B>lake, and turned off the car and the lights. We must have sat there
for about </B>
<P><B>5 minutes when my car started to move, it freaked me out I turned the
car and </B>
<P><B>the lights on and sped out of there, with some coaching from my friends
I </B>
<P><B>went back and resumed my original position in front of there gate and
we </B>
<P><B>waited. this time we were there for about 20 minutes when out of no
where my </B>
<P><B>friend Jenny in the backseat rolled down her window and yelled" You
sick </B>
<P><B>freak, you shot your wife and kid etc..." we all laughed for a second
at her, </B>
<P><B>but a second is all we had to laugh because my car started to bounce
up and </B>
<P><B>down like someone was pushing on the trunk, then all of a sudden my
car </B>
<P><B>started to roll backwards(up-hill)about 4 miles an hour straight back

towards </B>
<P><B>the lake, we must have been pushed about 200 feet when I saw the lake

comming </B>
<P><B>I turned my car and threw it into drive and we were out of there, no
one </B>
<P><B>talked we all just sat there while I drove, I could see in my rear-view

</B>
<P><B>mirror, the look of sheer panic and fear on my friends faces, my boyfriend

</B>
<P><B>sitting next to me just looked straight ahead, we pulled into a gas
sation, </B>
<P><B>far from the lake,and without saying a word to each other we all jumped
out </B>
<P><B>and ran to the front and back of the car to see the baby powder, on
the front </B>
<P><B>of my car were two sets of adult handprints, we all looked at each
other, and </B>
<P><B>my two girlfriends began to cry, the other boy who was with us just
stood </B>
<P><B>there and looked without speaking, my boyfriend and I ran to the back,
and </B>
<P><B>there on my bumper were shoe-prints from a child. I looked at him and

started </B>
<P><B>to cry to, I ran back to my car and my friends followed, I tried to
start the </B>
<P><B>car but it wouldnt start(my car has never NEVER given me problems before)

</B>
<P><B>after about 10 minutes it started and we went back to my friends house,

that </B>
<P><B>night we all slept in the same bed. we have never gone back, and decided

not </B>
<P><B>to tell anyone, afraid our peers would think us insane.  thank you
for your </B>
<P><B>time. I am sorry this was so long but, thats what happened.  </B>
