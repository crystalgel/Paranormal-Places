<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The house in </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">Winnipeg</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;"> was owned by my family between 1965 and 1996. My
grandfather owned it first, and after he and my grandmother died in 1985 and
1986 respectively, my immediate family owned it. I renovated the basement into
a bedroom/bathroom for my own use, but found myself "visited" a lot.
Something tried to get in bed with me once, and sort-of "clung" to me
like a "lover", or something. I turned to see who it could possibly
be, and saw that it was all a black form-or anti-form, like a hole in the air.
I yelled, and it disappeared.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I don't understand the
origins of such a thing in that particular place.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Around 1986 my family and I
moved into a home in vinita that used to house two residence. The upstairs had
its own kitchen bath and bedrooms. The downstairs could house a bigger family.
The side door that lead out into the drive way<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>was where I first seen a little old lady. We had such episodes that
never made any since. my mother had made a statement about a cat that she used to
own. Two hours later a similar cat appeared with the exact same markings as a
cat she had owned thirteen years earlier. Banging could be heard from under the
house that raised furniture off of the floor. The garage I never entered due to
bad vibes. After a few months of noises and mischef we decided to move. About
two weeks later we drove back past the old house and as I looked up into what
used to be my room there she was. It was a little old lady looking down at me.
The only thing is that she wasnt real...later the side of the house burnt in
both places where I had seen her. If we had still stayed me and my sister would
of been trapped in the upstairs and more than likely would of parished....<o:p></o:p></span></p>

lights flickering on and off and her house used to be really hot , but the
night i stayed there it was rather cold and<span style="">&nbsp;

in her hosue before she moved in and apparently he had died in his house<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and it was his lost spirit wondering around
his house as if nothing had happend to him .<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Hello everyone! I have been
sitting here reading some of your stories and thought I would share mine with
you. I don't know anyone who has ever experienced what I did when I was 4yrs.
old, but I would love to hear from anyone who has. Well here it goes... When I
was a little girl (3-4), my grandparents owned a farm in </span><st1:place><st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;">Salem</span></st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span><st1:State><span style="font-family: Arial;">Indiana</span></st1:State></st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">. My brother and I always spent our summers with my
grandparents (in </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">Salem</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;"> and later in </span><st1:place><st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;">Madison</span></st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;">, </span><st1:State><span style="font-family: Arial;">Indiana</span></st1:State></st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">). One particular visit to the farm in </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">Salem</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;"> would soon be my last. One thing you must know first
off is that my grandmother had a strict rule about going to bed and falling
asleep; you went to bed and went right to sleep. We were not allowed to stay up
after my grandparents went to bed. If we stayed up until they went to bed, that
was fine; but when they went to bed, we went to bed. Well back to my story,
when I was little my grandparents would always tell us if we did not go to
sleep the Sandman would come and put sand in our eyes to put us to sleep. My
brother and I were little so we believed them. I don't remember anything
unusual about my grandparents farm in </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">Salem</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;">; as far as it being haunted or anything, but I
remember one night, when I was 4. I remember that night in every detail: I was
watching T.V. with my brother, parents, and grandparents after dinner. We had
just arrived that day and my brother and I was going to stay for the summer and
my parents were leaving after a couple of days. Well it got to be late and my
parents went to bed; my brother and I stayed up with my grandparents. When they
went to bed, my brother went into the room he would sleep in and I curled up on
the couch. Now, normally, I had no problem falling asleep at night but that
night in particular I just could not fall asleep. So I laid on the couch, quiet
as a mouse just staring into the dark. I was not afraid of all the creaks and
other noises of the dark; I just laid there trying to fall back to sleep
because I did not want the Sandman to come and put me to sleep; afraid I would
never wake up. I remember laying on the couch and closing my eyes, trying to
sleep when all of a sudden I heard footsteps in the kitchen. Now the kitchen
was situated right off the living room and there was a big picture window in
the kitchen would provided much light into the house at night. So I laid there,
eyes squeezed shut. I thought I would get in trouble if it was my grandma or
grandpa who was up, and I was not asleep. Then the curiosity of who was awake
got to me and I opened my eyes. I saw a tall dark figure walk through the
kitchen, past the big window, and stop at the kitchen and living room doorway.
Then a voice spoke to me... it said, "Why are you not asleep little
girl?" At this point I knew it was not my parents or grandparents, so I
said, "I can't sleep." Then I asked the figure, "Who are
you?" He replied to me... "I AM THE SANDMAN!!!!" I never moved
so fast in my life; I jumped up off the couch ran across the living room and
into my grandparents room. I immediately jumped into bed with my grandparents
and this woke them up. They asked, sleepily, what I was doing? I said,
"The Sandman is in the kitchen and wants to put sand in my eyes!" I
was crying hysterically. My grandpa got up out of bed and checked the house. NO
ONE WAS THERE!!!! The doors were all still locked. My grandparents calmed me
down and told me to go back to sleep, and that I was just dreaming. I know it
was not a dream; He spoke to me. Needless to say when my parents got up the
next day and found out what happened the night before, they offered to take me
home (back to </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">Cincinnati</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;">). I never again stayed for an overnight visit on the
farm. I didn't stay with my grandparents again until they moved to </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">Madison</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;">; about a year later. Even though I was not much
older I would stay in </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">Madison</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;">
with them in the house they bought. I later found out the house in </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">Madison</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;"> was haunted. You would hear someone come in the back
door every night, hear them walk around the house and then leave. I soon
learned how to pretend I was asleep (my husband says I am a pro at making
people think I am asleep :-) Years of practice I say<span style="">&nbsp; </span>) I am not sure if the ghost in </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">Madison</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;"> was someone who lived in the house in the past or if
it was the Sandman coming back to see if I was asleep. All I can tell you is
every night I went to bed, whether I could fall right to sleep or night, I laid
in bed, eyes shut, and still. I did not want a second encounter with the
Sandman. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Hope this story was scary
enough for everyone because it still scares me to tell it or even think about
it. I must also mentioned, I have 4 children and I have never once told them
they had to fall asleep or the Sandman would come. I met Him once and I don't
want my children to meet Him. He was truly scary!!!!!!!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I was a forteen year old kid
when my family moved from </span><st1:place><st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;">Dallax</span></st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;">, </span><st1:State><span style="font-family: Arial;">Texas</span></st1:State></st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;"> to north </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">Georgia</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-family: Arial;">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My father
had bought a share in a little airport, Jolly Field, hoping to have a business
of his own finally as an aircraft mechanic.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He couldn't leave his job in </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">Dallas</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;"> until he tied up a few loose ends, so my mother
loaded my two brothers, sister, and me into the olds wagon and set off into the
unknown.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>None of us had ever been to </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">Georgia</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-family: Arial;">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dad's
partners had found us a little house where we were to stay temporarily until we
got our bearings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As it turned out, we
lived in that little house on a rural highway for many months.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The house was completely
furnished with old, cheap furniture not in very good repair.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There were shelves of porcelain figurines in
the tiny dining room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The walls of every
room had been papered and papered over many times.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A large front porch was completely screened
in, which was great as we had a little terrier who could sun herself without
wandering away, which she tended to do.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The front yard was huge, as were the side yards and the back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The nearest neighbors were hundreds of yards
away in equally old and rundown houses.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Beyond a clearing that
served as the backyard, there were woods.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On the edge of the woods, at the end of the clearing there was an old
tumble down wooden shed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">It was strange to come to
that place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It felt as though we had
invaded someone else's space.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whoever
had lived there before seemed to have taken nothing with him when he left.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">There was a great deal of
emotional tension wrapped up in the move and in moving into that house, which
my mother called a dump.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It certainly
wasn't what we had been used to.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">A couple of weeks later, my
father joined us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There were arguments,
threats of leaving this </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">Dalton</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;">
place, trouble between my parents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
brothers, sister and I struggled to cope with a seemingly completely different
culture, and a difficult to understand </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">Georgia</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-family: Arial;"> accent, as the school year began.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dad went off to work at his new
business.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mom stayed home and ran the
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Eventually we all calmed into our
new world.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">One weekend afternoon, my
younger brother and I explored the spooky shed in the backyard.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">It's been so long ago that I
don't remember everything that was in the debris filled building.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">What I remember is a large,
metal banded steamer trunk which I opened and rummaged through.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It contained disintegrating women's dresses
from some other decade, a deck of playing cards ca. WWII, and a large packet of
picture post cards postmarked early 1900's.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I took the postcards and the
deck with me and kept them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">We ventured beyond the shed
into the wood.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The ground was peculiar
in that it seemed to have long rows of dug out areas long overgrown.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I learned years later that at least one civil
war campaign had been fought in the area.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Who knows, maybe these were confederate entrenchments?<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Years later, my mother
claims that the events in the house began when I brought those old postcards
into the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I can't verify it, but
it's as good a place to start as any.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In the last couple of years
I've asked family members individually if they remember anything strange
happening while we lived there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
sister was only seven and remembers nothing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I however remember that she
had a room of her own, a room addition to the back of the house
specifically.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I remember that she was
afraid to stay in that room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was cold
and damp regardless of the weather outside.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I never felt comfortable, either.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nothing ever happened there, it just felt creepy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In the evenings my family
normally watched tv together in the living room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On more than one occasion we would hear a
crash from one of the bedrooms that sounded as if a closet shelf had
fallen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The dog would begin to whimper
and stand in a corner of the living room and stare at the wall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Odd, as the sound came from elsewhere.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nothing in the closets was ever out of place.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">My older brother calls it
rats in the walls.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It's plausible as
there were lots of heathy rats in the neighborhood.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">My younger brother, 12 years
old, remembers no such thing ever happening.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My older brother thinks my parents and are probably making it all up or
are romanticising normal occurances.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Dad was usually awake and
sitting with coffee at the breakfast table by </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="6"><span style="font-family: Arial;">six a.m.</span></st1:time><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="">&nbsp; </span>One morning
he stood at the kichen window gazing into the woods when a small child in the
garb of a hundred years ago walked thouugh the yard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since there were no neighbors, and no
children in the area besides us, he went outside to ask if she were lost.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No little girl, and nowhere she could have
gone without Dad seeing her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Little things in the house
would turn up out of place, inconsequential things like the settings on the
percolater changing, the settings on Mom's sewing machine being changed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was constant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Those early mornings, my
father would hear footsteps walking up the hall toward the kitchen, but no one
ever arrived there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My mother says she
would hear the same footsteps with the additional sound of rustling
petticoats.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She came to believe that the
female invisibility in the house was connected to those postcards, all of which
were addressed to a Nellie Teasley.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">My parents talked about
these things between themselves, but never with us kids.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">During this time, mom, who
is afraid of nothing became afraid of the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When we were at school and dad at work, mom
began staying in the front yard with the dog until dad came home for
lunch.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then she started to work with
him, helping run his business just so she didn't have to be in the house
alone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Meanwhile, the terrier still went
nuts eaverytime something happened.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Walking from our little
dining area into the kitchen, I would trip over something large in the
doorway.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To me it was like an invisible
footstool.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the same thing happened
to mom, she said it was like tripping over a dead body.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We did learn later that the old man who had
owned the house had actually died there not long before we moved in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">One afternoon, I found
myself alone in the house with our little phaedo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were in the living room watching tv.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The mirror that hung on the front wall
between the front door to the left and a window to the screened in porch right
began visibly flapping, beating against the wall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lady the terrier went to the usual corner and
shivered and whimpered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was over in a
few seconds.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I was frozen on the
sofa.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When Lady calmed down, I opened
the front door and beat the wall from the outside to determine whether it could
have been someone knocking agressively from the outside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not a chance.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The wall was solid and unmovable.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I don't know what happened.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">None of the rest of the
family ever had such an experience in the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then again, I never heard anyone walking up
the hallway.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I never stayed by myself
there again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">In a few months our new
place was finished and we split and didn't talk about the rural house for years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We did drive past it on occasion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Seemed it went through tenants fairly
regularly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mostly it stood empty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After a couple of years it burned to the
ground.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A trucking company built a
facility on the property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That company
didn't last long.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then we left north </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">Georgia</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-family: Arial;">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I haven't the least idea
what happened there after 1974.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">It's not much of a
story.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But it all happened exactly as I
describe.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Had I been older at the time,
I might have tried to look into the thing a little more.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Too late.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">My husband and I lived in
White Eagle, OK about a year and a half ago with our four children. One morning
about </span><st1:time minute="30" hour="16"><span style="font-family: Arial;">4:30</span></st1:time><span style="font-family: Arial;"> I was feeding my four month old son in my front room
when I saw a shadow cross the window. It stood about<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">7-8 feet tall and had the
shape of a man. I couldn't see what it was exactly because my blinds were
closed. But it walked in front of the window and stopped as if to look in the
front room and then continued to walk around the east side of the house where
my bedroom was.(Our bedroom was right off of the front room) It stopped in the
middle of my bedroom window and turned it's whole body to face my bedroom and
then turned around and walked off. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The next morning I walked
around my house and seen no footprints. I've been told by community members
that "big foot" is known to walk around by White Eagle and that was
what I saw. A couple weeks after that happened, my husband and I had just
gotten into bed and we heard a banging on our wall from the outside. My husband
thought is was the children playing a joke on us and he went outside to chase
them off, but found nothing. He came back in and got into bed again when we
heard something hit our front door. I told him to just leave whatever was
outside alone. I've lived in </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">Ponca City</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;"> my whole life and was raised knowing about big foot.
I do believe he walks around White Eagle and that was what I saw that night. At
night you can be outside and all of a sudden smell something really stink. I
was always told when you smell that it was big foot. White Eagle as a community
is haunted, I've heard so many stories about what people have seen or heard.
Thanks for taking time to read one of my stories.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Here's yet another I can't
believe I'm doing this. ever since I was little it seems that there has <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">always been a ghost in our
house. No matter were we moved. The last house that we all grew up in ( I have
12 brothers and sisters) there was a ghost that snored. At first we were all
scared <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">but eventually we got used
to him. I have had other ghost encounters since then but the one I <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">have now is different. I
live in a big farmhouse that has a studio apartment (where I live) in the<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">front and the rest is a huge
house that is rented out to college kids. I have lived there 3 years<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">and have gone thru 3
different groups of kids, but they all say the same thing. We have a ghost<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">in our house! I had always
wondered if there was one over there. The ghost never bothered me<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">until Jan. of this year. I
had gotten up around </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="5"><span style="font-family: Arial;">5 am</span></st1:time><span style="font-family: Arial;">
to use the bathroom and when i got back in<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">bed i could hear someone
else breathing next to me. When i rolled over there was no one there. It didn't
happen again until this Aug. The house next door has been empty for a couple of
<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">months so i'm in this big
house all by myself, which usually doesn't bother me. One night I<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">was having trouble sleeping
so I rolled over to try to get more comfortable and I felt the other <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">pillow come up against the
back of my head and then an arm and a leg thrown over me. I<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">lay there for a minute
trying to figure out who it could be when I knew i was alone. I went to <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">roll back over but I had to
push them over off me to do so. There was nobody there. It didn't<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">bother me at first, really
not till about a day later and now I think that I'm crazy. If the landlord <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">would just rent the other
side I think the ghost would go back over there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I have read alot of the
stories here, and noticed that alot of folks say this....I am not sure if I saw
a ghost but here's my story. As a child of about 5 maybe 6, I was the only boy
and had my own room. My two sisters had the room right straight across the
hallway from me. Now this was around 1976 or 1977, we had gas heat through the
entire house, so at night my dad would turn off all the heat. As a child in </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">Georgia</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-family: Arial;"> we used to have cold winters, so the house would be
very cold at night. I felt a cool breeze blow over my face and I woke up, I saw
a teenage girl standing in my doorway blond hair and wearing a long white gown.
I thought it was my oldest sister so I called out to her and said aint cha
cold? Well as you can guess she didn't answer me, I called out again and she
just stood there watching me. Well I quickly covered my head and when I peeked
out again she was gone and of course when I ran across the hall she was in bed
sound asleep. There were several things that happened in that old house, see
someone run across the porch and noone was ever there. Our bathroom had a hook
to lock the door, one day my middle sister and I were home alone and the door
was shut and locked...ok someone shut it and the hook fell and locked...NOT A
CHANCE! 10 minutes later the door was unlocked and opened right up. I really
don't know if I believe in ghosts or not, but I know what happened in that
house. Feel free to write me anytime.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

HOUSE<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">By: CowboyNEOK@aol.com<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="">&nbsp;</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Haunting at the old
Beauchamp House<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">After my parents were
divorced, I went to live with my grandparents at their farm house which was on
the edge of Grove, a small town on the shores of Grand Lake&#8217;o the Cherokees in </span><st1:State><st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">Oklahoma</span></st1:place></st1:State><span style="font-family: Arial;">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My family
had lived there for two generations, and there had been both joys and tragedies
that had occurred on the family homestead.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I would discover some tragedies were more discussed than others.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For instance, it was well known that the
house had burned down during the Great Depression, and had left the family all
but homeless.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They lived in what was
left of the garage until they could build a new house on the basement
foundation of the old family farmhouse.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">My bedroom just so happened
to adjoin the steps that led to the basement.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Many times, I would awaken and feel like something&#8230; SOMETHING was in the
room and watching me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There were spots
in the house, particularly in my bedroom, that were ICE COLD no matter what
time of year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My grandmother told me, at
a very troubling time in her life, she had been awakened by her long since
deceased mother.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My grandmother said my
great-grandma looked radiant and had sat at the foot of her bed, and made her
know everything would be okay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
experience had been very comforting to her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Again, there were things
about our family history my grandparents had never shared with me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One night in the dead of winter, I was
watching television.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was about sixteen
and my grandparents would let me stay up past their bedtime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I began hearing a bizarre strange, mewling
sound.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because we lived on a farm, I
thought it might be an animal of some type, but I had NEVER heard such a weird
cry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My hair stood up on my arms and the
back of my neck.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was one of the
coldest nights of the year, and it was snowing but I put my shoes on and walked
outside because I wanted to put my mind at rest. I didn&#8217;t think I could sleep
until I discovered what had made the noise.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I walked outside and scanned the property looking for any stray cattle,
and then I heard the noise AGAIN!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>BUT it
was coming from DIRECTLY ABOVE ME!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
looked up into the oak tree next to the house and there was a large branch that
had grown over the roof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A glowing ball
of light was pulsating about a foot above the branch and the strange mewling
sound CAME FROM THE LIGHT!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I almost
fainted&#8230; and I froze just like one does in dreams.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It seemed like an eternity before I shakily
made my way back into the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
really thought I was going to wet my pants.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I went straight to my grandparents room, and woke them up with a shaky voice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My grandfather was a lighter sleeper than
grandma and woke up and joined me in the hall.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He said, &#8220;What is wrong with you?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>You look scared to death&#8230;&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I haltingly explained to him
what I had seen, and told him it was a weird, WEIRD sound, and he asked me to
mimic it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I did my best to make the
noise, and all the color drained from his face and he quickly turned his
head.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I saw a tear fall from his eye,
and he wiped it away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I asked him what
was wrong, and he said I had just made the same sound his baby brother made
when he cried.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His brother had been born
with a cleft palate, and another malformation of his mouth that made it
impossible to nurse and he had eventually died of starvation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had never heard the story of my great uncle
and was absolutely SHOCKED!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He asked me
where I saw the light, and I took him outside and showed him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He told me I was pointing to where his
nursery had been located before the old family farmhouse had burned and they
had rebuilt a the current home on the foundation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At that point, I felt vertigo but we were
both able to make it back into the house.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I spent the rest of the evening wondering why my family had kept my
great-uncle&#8217;s sad death a secret.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
decided they did it because it was so sad they wanted to keep it to
themselves.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Eventually I fell asleep.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Its been years, since I&#8217;ve
lived in that house and since then </span><st1:place><st1:PlaceType><span style="font-family: Arial;">Grove</span></st1:PlaceType><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span><st1:PlaceType><span style="font-family: Arial;">High School</span></st1:PlaceType></st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;"> has built a baseball field named after my father,
major league baseball player - Jim Beauchamp, directly across from the old
Beauchamp house where I used to live.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
often wonder if those that attend the games ever see a glowing, pulsing ball of
light slightly above the roof, or hear a lonely, strange mewling sound coming
from the ol&#8217; Beauchamp House.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">1.This event happened on
Cave Hill cemetery in </span><st1:place><st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;">Louisville</span></st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;">, </span><st1:State><span style="font-family: Arial;">Ky.</span></st1:State></st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;"> My husband and I were up there with our friend
Marshall and his wife, Caressa. Well, </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">Marshall</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;"> wanted to videotape at the top of the cemetery, but
the oddest thing happened. His battery died...I know you are thinking what is
weird about that...but, once we left and headed down the hill. guess what???
The camera worked fine! I suppose someone didn't want to be on camera. I saw
that you have Cave Hill in your haunted places index. I can vouch for the truth
of that.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">2.Today is </span><st1:date year="2005" day="30" month="8"><span style="font-family: Arial;">August 30th
 2005-</span></st1:date><span style="font-family: Arial;"> a few days ago, I was
alone here and I was sitting at my computer and behind me, I a dish or
something fall. I couldn't find what had fallen.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">3.A few weeks ago, I was
alone when I heard a frantic knocking on my door. I jumped up to see who was
out there. Nothing around. Not even a bird chirping. And we live in the country
and you can catch if it is a person. [Although, last week, we found out one of
my husband's Aunts had a heart attack and must face surgery.]<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">4.June 8th 2005-My husband
and I had just went out to eat with our friends, Marshall and Caressa. We were
driving home when I saw a large orange ball of light arc for a moment then
suddenly vanish. I was the only one in the car to see this thing. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">5.June 11th, 2005-Again,
Marshall and Caressa had come to stay all night with us and George, my husband
had walked outside around 2:00 AM and saw a large yellow ball of light flashing
through the trees. He was the only one who witnessed it. [Note: the 4 of us are
ghost chasers and we do love ghost stories.]<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">6.May 24th 2005-Have you
seen Final Destination? If so, then you will understand why this scared me
badly. Think of Carl Jung's synchronicity idea---(I will list the events of
that day alphabetically)<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">A.That morning I had awoken
thinking about a dream I had had in the mid-1980's-In that dream, Arabs had
detonated an atomb bomb in the </span><st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">Appalachian
 mountains</span></st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;"> (this is where we
are from and live now.) I saw the mushroom cloud and felt the scalding hot
winds...in the dream, I thought I was one of many on a hijacked bus with Arab
terrorists. Now, remember I had this dream in the 1980's. Well, on 5/24/2005, I
started thinking that the government might detonate an atomic bomb in the
Appalachian mts. for a test. [I don't know why this was on my mind...but all
day long odd things happened.]<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">B.On CNN...they were talking
about the Hiroshima A-bomb. [Yes, I cringed.]<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">C.I picked up a book to look
through it. It opened to Oppenheimer-the father of the Atomic bomb! I had
checked out a book from the library on strange facts and Oppenheimer was in it!<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">D.Later that evening, the
movie, Sum of All Fears was on tv. Of course, in this movie, an A-bomb goes off
in </span><st1:place><st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;">Baltimore</span></st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;">, </span><st1:State><span style="font-family: Arial;">MD</span></st1:State></st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">!!<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">E.I picked up the phone book
and automatically the terrorist section fell open! What to do in case of a
terrorist attack! <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">F.Again, CNN mentioned that </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">North Korea</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="font-family: Arial;"> may use nuclear weapons.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">G.And my husband came home
from helping with a Funeral and told me that the tomb was like a bomb shelter!!
Plus, as an extra...he had said he was discussing Garbage Pail Kids and that he
and </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">Marshall</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;"> had talked about Adam Bomb!!<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">All that added up to freak
me out!! And I don't believe in coincidences, either. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

share these.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">When I was about 15, I hung
out with a very big group of friends.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
would all go to my friend Jeremy's aunt's house to hang out or what have
you.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now, this house has been in his family
since his great-grandfather bought it in the very early 1900's.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They all grew up there and Jeremy even raised
his two kids there for a couple of years, way after the event I will tell you
about.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was summer of 1995 and
Jeremy's great-grandmother Edna just passed away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Jeremy's aunt worked nights as a nurse and
told me I could stay in the old house and sleep while she was at work as I was
exhausted from partying the night before.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was about 7 or 8, dark outside and inside the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was stretched out on the living room floor
in between her couch and coffee table, all by myself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was just in the stage of sleep where you
are aware of things going on around you, but it just doesn't seem real.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The house was in dead silence as I lay there
slowly drifting off to sleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Suddenly,
I heard what sounded like a bell dinging as it very swiftly floated over my
body.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After I heard this, I looked up
very fast toward the dining room which was right in front of me, to see the
image of an elderly woman with curly hair and glasses looking right at me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I looked away and then back and saw
nothing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I got up ran out of the house
and went home confused and out of it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The next day Jeremy showed me a picture of his great-grandma that was in
the obituaries.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She had curly hair and
glasses just like the woman I saw.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Haunted for Years<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">By: P.Meronyck@courts.phila.gov<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">My house has been haunted
for years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have seen so many freaky
things that I don&#8217;t think anyone will believe it when I tell them so I won&#8217;t
get into all of them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">This one time I walked into
my house and I felt a really cold chill as soon as I walked into my dining
area.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As I turned the corner to where my
dining room table is I heard voices talking.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I did not recognize any of the voices so this made me a little nervous
or maybe it was just the nervous chill in the air.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">When I turned the corner I
saw something that defied all logic and beliefs that I had in the past.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There were three images sitting at my dining
room table involved in an intense game of monopoly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were arguing over who had the rights to
Board Walk and </span><st1:Street><st1:address><span style="font-family: Arial;">Park
  Place</span></st1:address></st1:Street><span style="font-family: Arial;"> and
whether or not you go directly to jail when rolling three straight
doubles.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I heard this discussion I
didn&#8217;t know whether or not I should say something or run away with my tail
between my legs.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I decided to speak
up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I said, &#8220;You definitely have to go
to jail if you roll three straight doubles.&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As soon as I said this the apparitions disappeared and I never saw these
specific figures again.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">About a year later, I came
home from working a late shift and I entered my house to the same cold
chill.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With the memory of my past
experience and the fact that the hair on the back my neck instantly stood up I
knew I was in for something crazy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
checking my house for anything unusual and not finding anything I made my way
to the bathroom to take a shower.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">After I got out of the
shower, I went to my room to get dressed like normal except that there was
someone lying in my bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I said, &#8220;Who
are you and what do you want?&#8221;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I got no answer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I got a little bit closer to get a better
look and what I saw changed my life forever.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was my ex-girlfriend who was killed in a motorcycle accident about
three years before this.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She told me
that she wanted to let me know that she was okay and not to worry about her
anymore.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">After she told me this she
started to get out of the bed. I realized that it was the face of my long gone
love but she had the body of a scorpion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I ran out of the room and shut the door.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When I went back later she was gone and I never saw or heard from her
again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I still am amazed by this
altercation to this day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Please do not take my
stories lightheartedly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As goofy and
unbelievable as they might sound I assure you that these things really happened
to me and they have changed my life forever and maybe they will change
yours.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Many years ago when I was a
small child, only the age of 6, my family and I moved into a new home that was
built for us. My mother and father enrolled my older sister and me in the local
elementary school. We where new to our home and new to our community and
anxious to start our new lives.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Within a few short weeks our
family began to attend services at the local Catholic Church. CCD classes where
held every Sunday after mass for the youth in our church. I was to receive my
first holly communion and was studying very diligently. I enjoyed my classes
and was excited to feel a sense of belonging.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Only after a month or so of
living in the house, I began to hear noises. I remember complaining to my
parents of the noises, especially at night. My parents explained that it was a
new house and it was &#8220;settling.&#8221;<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The noises progressively
become worse over the passing months. I would hear rustling sounds as if
someone or something was shuffling things around in the closet or just outside
of the bedroom window. Again, I was told that it was the house settling or some
raccoons in the shrubs outside.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Weeks of this passed and I
would ignore the noises until one evening the noises came from under my bed. It
began in the closet with some of the typical banging and rustling sounds. This
noise awoke me. Trying to ignore the sounds I suddenly became frozen with fear.
I heard the noise come from beneath my bed. I tried to call out, but could not
speak. A few moments of silence had passed and I leapt from my bed and rushed
into my parent&#8217;s room hysterically trying to tell them of what just happened.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I was horrified and
determined not sleep in my room. My parents compromised and left the hallway
light on and checked under the bed. This convinced me that all was well and
perhaps I was just imagining things.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">As my CCD classes where in
full swing and my First Holly Communion only a few short weeks away, my mother
was helping me practice remembering all the prayers. Each night my mother would
stand in the hall as my sister, who had the room next to me, and I recited
prayers. I believe that the reciting of prayer and my coming closer to
Communion and God only invoked the next occurrence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">With only a few days from my
Communion, everything was seemingly quite. I went to sleep only to be awoken by
the forgotten sounds of the banging and rustling in the closet. I sat up in my
bed looking forward to the metal closet doors. The noise stopped. I then saw a
little red man come in through the bedroom window and land on the foot of my
bed. It was short and swift and resembled a troll. I jumped from my bed and
started to run toward my parent&#8217;s room. The thing that came into my room from
the window jumped on my back and brought me to the floor in the hallway just
outside of my parent&#8217;s room. I was screaming terribly and woke my mother. She
came to the hall in horror. I was screaming to have her get it off of my back.
But she could not see it. There was nothing there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">My older sister woke up and
came to the hall as well. We all began to recite prayers and ask God for
protection from whatever it was.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">For the next few days I
slept with my older sister in her room and didn&#8217;t have any problems. I had a
good First Communion and all of the incidents seemed to stop.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">We moved from that house
into my Great Grandparent&#8217;s home a few years after and my family still lives
there today. Some things have happened in the current house, however, not as
terrifying. There are more in jest, such as covers being ripped off and doors
slam close and lock. I can&#8217;t describe it, but I feel as though whatever is
currently in the house isn&#8217;t there to harm, just to show its presence from time
to time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I grew up in </span><st1:place><st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;">Fountain Valley</span></st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;">, </span><st1:State><span style="font-family: Arial;">CA</span></st1:State></st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I lived<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><st1:Street><st1:address><span style="font-family: Arial;">Sparkleberry Street</span></st1:address></st1:Street><span style="font-family: Arial;">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was about
5 when we moved in and I was 24 when my parents were able to finally sell
it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since day 1 my brother and I had
always felt something odd in that house.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Late at night I would hear my door creek open, someone or something sit
at the edge of my bed and cover me up with my blankets-my brother would
experience the same thing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Myself, my
grandmother and other guests that had stayed with us mostly would see a woman
that wore some sort of flowy dress.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
always had things missing and there were always, and I mean always footsteps
and knocking noises.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nothing ever flew
across the room, but I would never be able to be in the master bedroom by
myself for a long period of time-and if it was at night-forget about it-I had
to turn on <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">every light up there.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My parents never believed us until my father
saw in <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">the reflection of the
computer monitor that was at the end of the landing on the second floor, a
young boy dressed in a sailor outfit-this was after we had lived there about 15
years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We tried selling the house a few
times and every time we tried, there would be more activity in the house
(typewriter tyoing, garage door opening and closing, always with the footsteps).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then escrow wouldn't go through and we'd stay
there a few more years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My parents were
able to sell it about 5 years ago and those people only stayed about a year and
a half.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We had<span style="">&nbsp; </span>2 priests (friends of the family) check out
the house and they said that they felt some sort of presence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We also had a real estate agent check out the
history of the house and all he could find was that it was built on bean fields
and there were people moving in and out of that house all the time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Apparently and even to this day, we are the
only family how stayed longer than 2 years.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There was always something weird about that place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I could go on in this email of all the other
things, but I am not sure how much information you need.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I really think something went on in this area
in the 1800's or so-the way the 2 at my house were dressed-then to read about
the sightings at </span><st1:place><st1:PlaceName><span style="font-family: Arial;">Fountain Valley</span></st1:PlaceName><span style="font-family: Arial;">
 </span><st1:PlaceType><span style="font-family: Arial;">High School</span></st1:PlaceType></st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I would
really like this investigated, I don't know how.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I do know that one night our
dog and all the dogs in the neighborhood would not stop barking-I thought
great, an earthquake, but nothing happened.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The next day in either the Daily Pilot or the Orange County Register,
there was an article on "ghostly sightings" in our neighborhood.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I wish I would have kept the article!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It talked about lights and figures being seen
moving diagonal from </span><st1:place><st1:PlaceName><span style="font-family: Arial;">Mile</span></st1:PlaceName><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span><st1:PlaceType><span style="font-family: Arial;">Square</span></st1:PlaceType><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span><st1:PlaceType><span style="font-family: Arial;">Park</span></st1:PlaceType></st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Like I said there were so
many weird things about this area, it would be interesting (and entertaining)
to investigate.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">i must confess.....our
family business was located on the corner of 19th ave and campbell.it was, and
still is, a preschool. upon opening the school door early in the morning,to my
utter disbelief , in one of the classrooms stood a little brown haired girl
just staring at me. she took off running to one of the other classrooms so i
searched the building to no avail. all of the doors leading to the outside had
inside latches placed very high on the door as to not let the small children
let themselves out. all doors were secure. the little girl was seen on several
occasions by all of my family and was accepted. she seemed to like the
preschool and was there everyday<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and
started to play little tricks on me (breaking the fire alarm glass, sweeping
the floor, cabinet doors and drawers would open and close, refridgerator
magnets would fly across the room by themselves), we had a classroom that would
remain cold all of the time, summer or winter.orbs appered in many pictures and
shirts were occasionally be tugged. i believe it is the same little girl in
your "phx"list and this is the first time i have heard of any
location having the same little girl walking around in that area.the building
was investigated and it was determined to have the little girl's ,as well as
other children's presence as well as a very negative and angry adult male's.the
little girl didnt like the man and would'nt listened to him as the others did.
she would hide from him and only let herself be known when he wasnt around. i
grew fond of the little girl and her playful antics..she sounds like the one in
your article and i was very astonished at the similarities.it's sort of a
unheard small history of a possible reason, of what happened to her in life.
thanks for the insite<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The wife of the man who
still lives there died in that house.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I was once involved with
this man for several years after his wife passed and voices are heard, but you
can't make out what they are saying. shadows appear along the walls, loud
kitchen type noises. ON separate occasions, I have personally seen two male
looking objects in the bathroom in the master bedroom.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">She died in the
masterbedroom. <o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I used to take great pains
to nicely sort the silverware tray only to go and find it an utter mess!<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The man that lives there
keeps the house shut up and dark. Her remains are in an urn inside the house
and he keeps moving it to different locations..sometimes its in the master<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>bedroom or the spare bedroom or out in the
living room..different places.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I was house sitting
last<span style="">&nbsp; </span>year for him while he went up north
for a visit and during hurricaine charley my folks came over to ride out the
storm and they left saying it felt spooky there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I've lived with it<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and lived in that house, and it doesn't
bother me, but she is still there and brought some friends with her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">most of the activity is in
the master bedroom and master bath.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I just don't understand what
the voices say. its weird . you can hear them talking and yet you can't figure
out what they are saying. some nights its constant chatter and other nights its
quiet.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>If you want to hear some interesting truths
about the things going on in this home that I rent,please let me know.....My
name is Laura,and I live in a building in Milllington that has constant
activitity going on....You see, I am not sure if I should say anything because
I love the lady that owns this building and I do not want to do or say anything
that will ever hurt or embarrass her......She is a very special woman who has
never experienced the things that many who have lived here experienced and
still does experience here.........So after truely thinking about this,and with
the understanding that the building connected to this does not belong to her,
but to another buisness owner, I am going to tell you about an accounter my
co-workers and I have had working at Fairway Discount Store.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A friend of mine was a manager there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was a key holder as well. Closing the store
one night with another cashier,Maria was already outside when </span><st1:PersonName><span style="font-family: Arial;">Tina </span></st1:PersonName><span style="font-family: Arial;">punched in the alarm code, started to walk out the door when she heard a
voice say something alone the lines of "Wait,don't leave me!"...
Freaked out,she closed the door and locked it. She turned around and asked
Maria if she heard anything and Maria no. Since I literally lived next door,she
came to my place pounding on the downstairs door until my neighbor Cliff and I
answered it.She told us what happened,said that she thought she might of locked
someone inside the store and wanted the both of us to go down with her to look
around.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All four of us went into the
store together.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While she called the
owner,Cliff,Maria,and I searched the entire store and was unable to find anyone

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I'm Trish. I live in </span><st1:place><st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;">Petaluma</span></st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span><st1:State><span style="font-family: Arial;">California</span></st1:State></st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;"> and was a member of The International Order of
Rainbow for Girls, until I met the ghost that lives in their building. The
Masons go way back, George Washington, and Thomas Jefferson and Theodore
Roosevelt way back, they mention it in the new movie National Treasure. Well
they have a non-profit group for girls 11-20, Rainbow Girls, to help the
community and help make us respectable women. But its kinda hard to work with a
very protective ghost. Lots of old Masons have breathed their last breaths in
that building, since it was one of the first built in </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">Petaluma</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;">. I always wondered why we had one of the smallest
memberships and so few visitors, you got rewards for visiting other assemblies.
I was one of the not so lucky girls. When we were emptying out the building for
earthquake retrofitting and upgrades I saw him. He through the doorway of a
room (with a mysterious trapdoor that later got boarded and carpeted up) with
no other doors and no windows. The closest light came from<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">15 feet away from a small
crack between the bathroom door and the floor and from an independent light
fixture in the ceiling 35 feet away, it had decided not to work just then! As I
was drinking a small paper cup of water facing my friend who had her back to
the door I brought my cup down and he started to materialize from his face
down. Needless to say I only saw his left hand and was out of there! When I got
down stairs and out of the building our Mason loading the truck said I looked
like I had seen our ghost, OUR GHOST! He knew I had met him and got me to
explain what had just happened, down to the blue Mason suit and he supplied the
stern face with mean, glowing ice blue eyes. My friend was the only one who knew
something had happened. She only saw the strange bluish light and the
reflection in my eyes but that and the chill in the room was enough for her. We
promised not to tell the other girls and said I had the flu since I was
completely white flushed and freezing and sweating and we went home early to
keep it a secret. The Masons finished empting out the building and I was filled
in by my best friend and her brothers also in Masonic groups in the building.
They had never told me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When they were alone in the building, just
the two brothers, practicing their guitar duet they heard loud piano they
thought was coming from the music store a couple hundred feet away, but in the
same building, so they eventually couldn't continue cuz it was to loud and went
to leave when they realized it was coming from upstairs in the dinning room
where there is probably still an upright piano. So they went upstairs to have
whom ever was up there leave with them. When they went to push the dining room
door open no one was there. The huge ballroom/dinning room was empty so they
stopped and listened. Nothing. One of them stayed put and the other crept
around to check the small dinning room and large kitchen and attic route, since
the other could watch the bathrooms and stairs and if anyone doubled back
around.One last check of the bathrooms and they teamed back up, the one never
left his post and pointed out the very cold breeze now coming from the large
dinning room and they went in to make sure the fire escapes were really closed
and all the windows as well, they didn't want to get in trouble.That's when
they saw the piano was closed, they had never heard it close, but all the
windows and doors were locked tight and the room was still breezy and cold, so
they could leave. as they passed the first table they heard the loud sound of
thick fingers impatiently thumping pinky to first finger in an empty room. They
apologized and moved very quickly out of the room.When the door was closed they
started off even quicker to the much louder music of the piano in the dining
room. They opened the door and it stopped and the lid was closed. The wind
helped them close the door and the music was even louder as they all but ran
out. They did not tell anyone for a long time. This is when I start to strengthen
myself so I have more control and understanding and can move on. Thank goodness
I did because the dreams began that night!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">On December 20th of 2004 my
aunt passed away very suddenly from a blod clot that went to her lungs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A few days after her death my mom was in her
bedroom gathering wash and I was my room with my 2 year old neice. I went out
into the hallway to ask my mom something and she asked if I had come into her
room a couple minutes earlier and I said no.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She said that while she was bending over to get things out of her hamper
she heard someone say "hey". I told her it wasn't me but maybe she
heard my neice, which was not really possible since my door was shut and my
mom's room is at the other end of the hallway. I asked her what it sounded like
and she said it sounded like a whisper but it was quick and she couldn't tell
if it was male or female.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The next thing
that happened was also to my mom. It happened about a week or so after my aunt
died. It was the middle of the night and my mom was awakened by a voice which
she said belonged to my aunt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My mom
never looked over and she was still kind of in a daze but she was awake enough
to answer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My aunt said that she missed
work to which my mom said ok.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And then
my aunt said it's ok here. She didn't sound very happy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then she told my that she had to pray for her
and my mom said ok but then my aunt said it again more insistantly so my mom
said ok louder. My mom looked over and didn't see anything and fell back
asleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A few days later my mom went to
church to light a candle for my aunt and an older lady walked yp to her and
handed her a card with prayers on it and said that they were very powerful
prayers and that my mom needed to be careful what she prayed for. I joked with
my mom asking her if the lady disappeared as she walked away (which she
didn't). The last thing that happened took place in my room while my neice was
sleeping over.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While my mom was getting
her ready for bed my neice kept saying that someone was ticklin her feet. My
mom looked over and my neice had her feet on my bed not hanging over but so she
didn't get scared my mom just said that it was my pair of boots. The next day
my neice told me the same thing and I asked her to show me how my
"boots" were tickling her feet and she wrapped her fingers around my
toes. I told her that it was just my boots and there was nothing to worry
about. I don't know if she bought cause to this day she still brings it up and
the next time after that she was a little skittish about sleeping in my room.
Thanks for letting my tell my story I hope you enjoyed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I'm new to this site.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>BTW it's a great site just wanted to let you
know :)<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Anyways, on with the
occurence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Last night I was super tired
so I fell asleep on my couch in the living room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Everything was fine, nothing out of the
ordinary at all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I actually got some
good rest until this one point in my sleep I start to dream.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I dream about this small boy (maybe 5-6)
that's wearing a nightgown and he just sits there and looks at me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now what was weird about the dream is that I
was in my house lying on my couch, so it's hard to tell if i was asleep or
not?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anyways, most the time in my dreams
i can tell it's a dream because i'm in a weird place, or nothing will be
exactly how it is in real life.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, i'm
rambling, on with the story.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anyways the
boy has half of his face like missing.. Either it's lost in shadow or just
gone, and his eyes were a deep black color.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I kept waiting for him to say something to me, and he said nothing so I
spoke to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I asked him what he was
doing in my house, that I didn't have any children here for him to play with,
but that i'd take some time to play with him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He said, "No, something bad is going to happen."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Immediately (even in the dream) I was
scared.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I asked him why he was letting
me know, and why was something bad going to happen?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He said, "no reason, i just know you and
something bad is going to happen to you."<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That's all I actually remember about the dream (if it was a dream).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anyways, that wasn't too scary the real
kicker is, I came into work the next morning, still thoroughly shook up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I told my co-worker about the strange dream
and we were kinda laughing about it a little, anyways, to get to the
point.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I get a phone call about 5
minutes after that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was my g/f, she
had been in a wreck at her school and was so upset it wasn't even funny.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I calmed her down as best I could because i was
shook up too.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I've had dejavu before,
and I'm not sure if i've dreamed it or experienced in real life, but this one
definately was some kind of warning ahead of time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Or maybe it was my subconcious letting me
know of it ahead of time?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I'm not sure what
it was, but I have had other strange things happen to me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Like I have clairvoyant dreams, but I
truthfully think there is a ghost that's speaking to me when I'm asleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It's not a purely evil being because although
I'm scared of him, he's never done a thing to try to hurt me, as far as I can
tell, he's trying to help me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>anyways,
I'd like you to put my email address up for people to tell me about their
similar happenings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I'm sure this isn't
very scary, but It sure as heck scared me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">i entered a a place in the
hauntings for bushnell </span><st1:place><st1:State><span style="font-family: Arial;">florida</span></st1:State></st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">
about a big house i have experienced stuff when i was sleeping. people say
ghosts come to ou in your dreams. i dreamed that i was lost and i was talking
to a guy dressed in the old uniforms that wear in the reactmenta there at dade
battlefield and he was telling me i could bunk there for the night.so iwas
sleeping and i woke up to the old captian or sargeant<span style="">&nbsp; </span>throwing a pair of clothes on me<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and telling me to get up and i could wear
those so i woke up to that and it felt so real it freaked me out.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">another night i was sleeping
and i heard footsteps coming up stairs in the hall and i was acting like i was
asleep and this man was standing at the door with a green glow around him and
he pointed at me and i was trying to wake my boyfriend up (my boyfriend at the
time) and i couldnt move or scream<span style="">&nbsp; </span>so i
woke up with a sweat and was freaked about that.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Another me and my best
friend was out in the pasture talking in a wide open space looking at stars and
we had woods all around us and we heard some one walking through the woods (no
one was there ) it was nt an animal you can tell when an animal is brushing
through leaves or a cow. Cows are heavier and has four legs and so does
little<span style="">&nbsp; </span>animals and we all know what they
sound like but this was a human being then we heard the noise all around us we
took off running the sound was closer to us as we are rtunning through this
opened area without leaves. we just kept running til we got to the big house
and locked the doors and called my friends mom told her what happened then the
guys came home and we told them and we thought it was them but they were up
town at the parts store. Weird huh?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I stayed with my friend for
4 weeks this summer and her house is haunted. She told me about it before hand,
but I didn't belive her. I told her I did, you know just humoring her. But the
second night I was there I felt so afraid. Thats not even the right word. I was
terror stricken. I'm the type of person who when I feel something bad at night
I look where I sence it. I don't hide. But that night, laying on my matress on
her floor. I was to scared to take the blanket off my head. I felt threatend
and l felt like there was a male watching. Oh I was so scared. I got like 2
hours of sleep that night. There was anice ghost, his name was Jesse. I'm not
sure how my friend learned his name, but I wasn't afraid of him. I can't see
them. I don't think I can really sense them unless they're directing at me. But
I can feel them. When all the sudden it gets cold, in places there couldn't
possibly be a draft. I didn't believe in ghosts. But I do now. I was carrying
my laundry down stairs where the laundry room was and I swear I was pushed down
the stairs. El said the ghosts in her house didn't like me there. I'd see
things sometimes, shadows moving, reflections. Even now, when I'm not there I
can't quite accept that those were ghosts. El and I were hyper one night and we
decided to record our selves to see how we sound to other ppl. Well we recorded
for like 5 mins. then stopped and played it back. Between our talking you could
hear very clearly a womens voice saying "I'm fine." It sounded very
breathy, El thought it was the girl who she see's sometimes in her window from
the outside. So we decided to just record while we were quite. We recorded for
about 50 mins. Playing it back and listening to it, I remember phrases. When we
were in her bathroom we heard "Wheres the boy?" and later in the
recording theres a roar. Theres no ways to explain it. I mean you can hear me
and El talking then we stop and it happens. We tried to listen to it a few days
later and it didn't work, the whole recorder. So we put new batteries in it,
still nothing happened. That happened at her house, electronics died or used
batteries very quickly. A couple of weeks later we tried it, and it worked. I
don't think I'm am going to go back there any time soon. And I really wish I
could not believe. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I've been hearing thing's
and seeing thing's for a long time know, and when I saw this web site I just
had to say my first experience of seeing a spirit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">It started When I was seven,
I used to hear thing's in the dark. I can't sleep with out a light on now. I
have always felt the presents of other beings, but none of this prepared me for
my first sighting.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">It was a Tuesday and I was
rushing to my next lesson, when I felt I was being watched. I looked around, no
one was looking at me they were to busy messing around. I looked up at the
windows of our health centre and was surprised to see a girl there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">She was not a student and
she was certainly not one of the teachers kids who was of sick because she was
ill.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The girl was wearing a black
dress with a with white apron, she had in her hand what looked like a bonnet.
She looked about the age of nine, and had a pale peaky face, and bushy dark
brown hair.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I was really surprised that
I started to feel the presents of some thing not quite human. But I was sure
this was a reel person, she looked as solid as I did.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The girl then mouthed
something to me; "I am Waiting"<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I got the chill's all down
my back and I felt that I was going to be sick. My Friend Ell- (Not her real
name, she asked me not to mention it) caught up with me and seeing the distress
I was in asked me what was wrong.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I told her what I had seen,
but as I did the girl from the window disappeared.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">My Friend suggested that if
this girl indeed was a ghost maybe I could find out who she was in the school
record book. ( Our School is a very old building).<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I did just that after lunch,
I found out that this girl dated back to about Victorian times. She had drowned
in the lake near bye. Her name was Sara, she worked as a maid.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Normally a maid would not be
noted in a record book, but it is said that after she died she came back and
haunted the big house, (Which is now my school).<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">There was picture of her
too, well not of her she was one of the many maids lined up behind the family
for the photograph.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I told my friend this, and
we had a good laugh about how we were being history detectives.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Then Came light's out in all
the dormitories and I fell asleep only to be awoken by a droplet of water
falling on my head.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Now the girls in my dorm
love to play prank joke's, so I decided not to give them the satisfaction of
squealing with annoyance, then another drop of water and another. The girls
would have given up by now so I opened my eyes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Sara's Face was inches away
from mine! I tried to scream but no notice came out. I couldn't move or speak.
I could barley blink. Sara Stood up a little and said to me; "I'm Waiting
for her, but she wont come. No one remembers me now.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I looked at her properly
now, she was socking like she had gone to have a bath with her cloths on. Then
she looked at me un happily as if she was waiting for some thing then she
disappeared.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I went up and woke Ell and
told her the whole story. I didn't sleep at all the night, and I was so existed
in the morning that I was sent to the health to sleep.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">But My Pease was not there.
Sara was there again, except this time she wasn't wet. She mealy stood by the
window, I was so scared but I realised that just sitting there was not going to
solve any thing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">"Go away" I said
hiding under the duvet.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Sara started sobbing, I
could here her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">"I can not" She
told me, "My Mother has not come, My Mother has forgotten"<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Then she was gone and I
finally slept. When I woke up I decided that this girl had probably been
forgotten here at this house, No One had obviously cared that she had died. Me
and Ell decided to finish her long wait so we picked some flowers and went to
the river. We Said a prayer about her then through the flowers in to the water.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I never saw her again but as
we left, There was a sense of gratitude in the air.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I have always been pretty
sensitive, able to recognize the spirit world.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>When I enter certain places, my hair stands on end and I feel
uneasy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have had several paranormal
experiences, and in fact I believe my house to be haunted by a benign
spirit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, I will focus on my most
recent experience, which occured in an old hotel in </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">Boston</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am 23, but
my brother is only 17.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This summer, I
took him up to visit </span><st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">New
 England</span></st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;"> colleges (my mother
was recovering fram a knee injury at the time so I volunteered to take
him).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We stayed in </span><st1:City><st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">Boston</span></st1:place></st1:City><span style="font-family: Arial;"> for three days, looking at various colleges in the
area.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We booked a suite at an old
hotel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I felt nothing unusual in the
lobby of the hotel, but as soon as we got up to our room I began to feel
uneasy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I let my brother have the
bedroom and slept on the pullout couch in the "living area" of the
suite.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the place where I was
sleeping, there was also a desk with a small worklight.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This will be important later.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anyway, I felt uneasy so was ready for any
psychic event to occur.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That night, I
made sure all of the lights were out when I went to sleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="3"><span style="font-family: Arial;">3 am</span></st1:time><span style="font-family: Arial;">,
I was awoken to the light of the desk lamp.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I was still half asleep, but I thought I saw the bedroom door close so I
assumed that my brother had sat at the desk for some reason and had gone back
to his room without turning off the light.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, in the morning, my brother denied that he had gotten out of bed
at all, and neither he nor I have a history of sleepwalking.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I felt even more strange but after a long day
of college tours I had pretty much forgotten about the incident,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The "electrical problems" continued
the next night, however.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both TV's in
the room would randomly turn on, turn off, and change channels by
themselves.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We called the front desk but
the man they sent to our room could find no problem.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was then I told my brother that I
suspected that the room was haunted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
suggested we change rooms or hotels but I said that we were only staying one
more night anyway.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I now wish we had
changed rooms.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The next night I fell
asleep peacefully, but was almost immediately awakened by my coveres being torn
off.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I sat bolt upright and turned on
the light but there was nothing and nobody in the room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, in the little kitchenette, the coffee
maker switched on and the sink started to run.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I was now terrified. I sensed that this spirit could do my harm if it
wished.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The hotel door banged open,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>as if the spirit was throwing me out of its
domain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, I calmly explained that
we would be leaving the next day and that it must leave us alone. Incredibly,
the spirit seemed satisfied and the room went back to normal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Still, I was unable to sleep the rest of the
night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the morning, I rushed my
brother out of the door as soon as possible.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Amazingly, he never woke up during the whole experience.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am not sure exactly what went on there that
night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I could not find out anything
from the hotel's employees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was an
interesting, paranormal experience.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thanks for letting me share.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>-Claire<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Hi, my name is Andrew, my
first ghost encounter happened during my preteen years when I was watching t.v.
in my living room. I was five in the morning and I felt it was getting really
late so I headed out toward my bedroom and to get there I had to go through a
long dark hallway so as I reached the beginning of the hallway, I saw a white
figure just standing there about three feets away from me and i kept on walking
and as i passed her i could see her rotating<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>just watching me.. man.. that wasn't the last time I would see her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">there was a night where i
was woken up in the middle of my sleep beacuse i heard something in the
hallway.. it was two in the morning and it was one of those rare occasions
where my bedroom door wasn't closed completely and this really brought chills
down my spine.. as i opened my eyes.. the sound got louder, it was a sound of
crying.. something was moaning and crying in the hallway.. i was terrified to
dealth and i couldn't<span style="">&nbsp; </span>move all i could do
was to go back to sleep.. and well, at two in the morning.. it was nothing.. i
was knocked out.<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">i've seen a lot of sightings
like a shadow that glides along the walls.. with two red eyes and a beakish
nose..<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">there was one time i was
coming home and when i got out of my car i look out onto my street and i saw a
kid on a tricycle that dissappeared after the fences.. he wasn't any ordinary
kid.. he was glowing green.. and head this evil laugh like witch..<o:p></o:p></span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial;">my latest sighting was when
i was watching my home videos with my nephew and i set the camcorder to be
facing us, and when we finished viewing like 8 hours of video we were exhusted.
so i walked right up to my camera and switched it from play mode to shoot
mode.. and you will never guess what we both saw.. i looked closely at the t.v.
screen and saw something in the cornder of the screen.. asked my nephew if he
saw it.. his eyes were wide open and he just nodded.. i directed him out the
door with my eyes giving him the signal to run.. we dashed out the room never
to go back in.. what we saw on the screen was a lady standing on my mother's
dresser that was against the corner.. i will never forget her face.. it was
just blank, her eyes where wide open and she was just stand there staring at
us.. i remember when we ran out the room, i stared back at the corner and she
vanished.. till this day.. i never saw anything again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
