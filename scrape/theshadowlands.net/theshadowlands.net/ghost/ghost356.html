<p class="MsoNormal">Hi i have two stories really weird. The first one is when i
was like 5 years ago i was asleep with my grandmother in is bed. During the
night i saw myself come in the room, say something and the grab the blanket.
The funny thing is that i did that in this evening and i said something because
i was thinking that a ghost was there. This night i amolst not sleep...the
other happened is a restaurant. I was working a coffee shop in night and we saw
many stranges things : flying things, the oven was starting by itself, opening
fridge. The main thing happened the day that im buried his mother, we lost
electricity at the beginning of the ceremony and regain it at the end. We where
the only shop to lose electricity that day...<span style="">&nbsp;

<p class="MsoNormal">When I was a child I was raised up in <st1:place><st1:City>Masonville</st1:City>
 <st1:State>Ky</st1:State></st1:place> there wasand old brick 2-1/2 story house
there beleved to be civil war relic. they say it was haunted but I could never
witness the things reported there but something was very strange about the
place. You could go there alone or with others sit very quietly upstairs an you
woud hear and feel doors slaming very hard go downstairs and all was quiet go
back upstairs and hear it repeadily over and over slam so hard it would jar the
walls but go down there was nothing some of the chains were still in place
inthe attic where slaves were held and there were open slots for shooting guns
from attic theysaid an old woman burned to death in one of the rooms it was
nailed dhut to keep people out of cause they said<span style="">&nbsp; </span>smoke in her shape drifted around the room so
I never got to go in there. but one room up stairs if you go in by yourself the
door would slam shut and you couldnt get out two of us went in but had to raise
the attention of others to come open the door from the outside it seeems the
room was out of balance and when shut if you were inside it wedged the door too
tightly to open but standing on the outside caused it to open freely. <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Hi, my name is Lisa.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I am from <st1:place><st1:City>Minneapolis</st1:City>, <st1:State>MN</st1:State></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had two ghostly expierences.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My first expierence was when I was about 4 or
5 years old.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We lived in this very old
apartment complex.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My grandmother, her
sister, my parents and my younger brother also lived in our apartment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My grandmother's sister was very old and died
of old age.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We had her funeral in <st1:place><st1:City>Sacremento</st1:City>,
 <st1:State>CA</st1:State></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A week after she died, I was in my parents bedroom playing with my
younger brother.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was during the day,
the sun was out and everything.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All of a
sudden I looked up and there she was, my grandmother's sister.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was standing right in front me,
smiling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I loved her dearly, and my
mother heard me talking.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She came into
the bedroom and she had seen her, herself.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And that was that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the age of
4 I didn't know that I had seen a spirit, but at that time I was not scared and
now, I feel blessed to have been visited by her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My second expierence happened in 2000.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My family and I went to visit my father's
aunt and uncle in <st1:place><st1:City>Utica</st1:City>, <st1:State>NY</st1:State></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It's a small suburb which had lots of old run
down train/bus stations and old homes.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I've been to their home several times and my cousins whom had lived in
that home would always tell me stories of this woman that had lived in that
home a long time ago.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They told me that
the woman had lived in the house by herself.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She met a man, fell in love and got pregnant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The man that she fell in love with wanted
nothing to do with her or the child, so he left her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The woman was terribly devasted and went into
a deep depression.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She had the baby, but
the baby had several medical complications due to her depression.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So she lost her baby.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well, the woman went mad and hung herself in
one of the bedrooms upstairs and from then on, my relatives that lived or spent
the night in that home have expierienced ghostly sightings, sounds and
doings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I didn't believe them at first
until I went to visit in 2000.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was
our second night in the home and we all slept in the living room together.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My parents, my brother and I and two of my
cousins.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was sleeping on the pull out
bed from the sofa and I was awaken by something, I'm not sure of what.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I looked at the end of the bed and that's
when I saw a lady dressed in white, floating.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She was looking straight at me and in her arms was a baby.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I didn't think anything of it, because I
thought I was dreaming.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I just sat there
staring at her for no more than 2 minutes and she just disappeared.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I woke up the next morning and asked everyone
that was sleeping in the living room if they had seen what I had seen and none
of them said they did.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Everyone thought
I was just having a nightmare of acting crazy except for one of my cousins.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The one who actually had lived in the house
and he told me that he has been visited by her several times and he said that
she visits you because she wants you to know that she is now with her
baby.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And those are my ghostly
expierences, hope that I didn't bore anyone.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thanks!<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>House on the Bluff</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: rqmcnasty@yahoo.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">this happened when i was thirteen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>i lived in <st1:City><st1:place>milwaukee</st1:place></st1:City>,
<st1:State><st1:place>oregon</st1:place></st1:State>, which has grown to be a
suburb of <st1:City><st1:place>portland</st1:place></st1:City> but at the time
was a small town on the willammette river.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>one of the poorer sections of town was on a peninsula where the railroad
trestle crossed mclaughlin boulevard at a closed-down pizza parlor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>this area faced the river and rose into a
bluff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>there were many victorian era
homes there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>in the early seventies most
of them nearer the trestle were run-down rentals.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">this was where my friend lucy fischer lived with her sister
and cousins. she invited me over and mentioned that her house was haunted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>being thirteen i was all for that, so my dad
drove me over one sunday, grumbling all the way since it was a long drive from
our house and in a slum to boot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>when we
got there i could tell he was less than pleased at leaving me off in front of
this place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>it was a three story
victorian with a tower on the side and a small tunnel shaped opening on the
sidewalk level big enough to push a pony trap into-thats how old the place was.
it was seedy and run down, grey, with crappy shingles and patches of bare shake
showing. you had to climb another storeys' worth of cement steps to get to the
front door from the sidewalk. (any oregonites recognize the place? e-mail me at
redace1960@yahoo.com) </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">this is the key part...... i remember it was early september
and the middle of a heat wave-unusually hot for the willammette valley -99
degrees. dead still most days and worse down by the river because of the
humidity.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">my friend met me and we went through the house meeting her
sister and cousins.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the place was
totally ratty...sis was no housekeeper and they were poor as churchmice. no
a.c., no fans.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>every window in the
house that could be opened was, all the doors too.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>still it was like walking into an oven.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>my friends sister said, take her up to the
haunted room, that'll cool you off.'<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>everyone chuckles.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>lucy leads and
we both begin climbing the stairs up to the third floor. as we went up the
steep, narrow stairs hanging onto the bannister you could feel it get hotter
and hotter; not unusual seeing<span style="">&nbsp; </span>it was an
old, uninsulated house standing full in the sun on top of a bluff, no trees
around, and no wind.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>by the time we got
to the haunted room on the third floor we were literally dripping sweat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the walls were warm to touch, the stair
railing, the carpet, everything.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(by
this time i've gone from the "neat! a haunted room!'<span style="">&nbsp; </span>frame of mind to a<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'this better be &amp;@?! 'in good after all this'<span style="">&nbsp; </span>frame.)<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>the door to a small room painted white was standing open at the end of a
short hallway off to the left.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>you could
see right into the room.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>entering, lucy
pointed out<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that a huge framing nail had
been pounded<span style="">&nbsp; </span>through the carpet with the
head bent into the door holding it against the wall, keeping it open.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>it was covered with old beat up paint the
same color as the door. been like that for awhile, since before they moved in.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">we walked in to this empty, small room-one set of windows
facing north and the other facing east with the sun blaring in-and the room was
cold.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>like a basement cold. you could
walk through the open doorway into the hot, hot hallway and back into the
chilly room and feel the abrupt temperature change.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>both sets of over and under windows were
painted shut.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>there was absolutely no
breeze whatsoever, no movement of air at all.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>i looked all over the room-there wasnt much to see, no furniture, a
built-in closet on the west wall with a sliding door and a couple of wire hangers,
and another on the south wall next to the entry door with a spring latch, which
was shut- stained green wall to wall carpeting and that's it.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>by the time i had made all these
observations i'm beginning to get seriously scared, but also overawed too.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>i was expecting bullshit, but this was truly
unexplainable and the longer i stayed in the room the more 'wrong' it got.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the walls felt chilly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the windows felt chilly-single pane, wavy,
hand rolled glass on the third floor of a house in the middle of a
heatwave.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>at the exact moment i felt
that i wanted to leave, the closet door nearest the doorway on the south wall
popped open. and continued to open. and open, until it met resistance with the
carpet, yet still opening, scraping across the carpet until it touched the
wall.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>i ran down the three flights of
stairs with my friend cracking up behind me.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>her sister and the kids laughed too.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>i asked where the phone was, then went and grabbed it anyway without
waiting for permission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>i called my dad
and told him to come get me. then i turned around and told these people that
they were crazy to live there.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>i went
out on to the front step to wait for my dad.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>my friend waited with me and said her sister thought i was really rude
and didnt want to see me again and i said 'no problem.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>i'l never come back here.'<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">i am in my mid forties and have thought about this many
times.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the thing that sticks with me is
the inexplicable 'wrongness' of it. there was nothing to doubt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>everything happened in broad daylight, it was
observed, felt, seen and heard-and by more than one person...this wasn't an
experience at the edge of sleep or the middle of the night, it wasn't 'images'
or 'impressions' or 'weird feelings', nothing vague or shadowy or specteral.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>i wonder if that house still stands, and
who's living there now.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">JOY ASSISTED LIVING (<st1:place><st1:City>SPRINGFIELD</st1:City>,
 <st1:State>MO</st1:State></st1:place>)</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I worked for a place called Joy Assisted Living, located on <st1:Street><st1:address>Mt.
  Vernon St.</st1:address></st1:Street> in <st1:place><st1:City>Springfield</st1:City>,
 <st1:State>MO.</st1:State></st1:place> It is a beautiful facility, but can be
very eerie, especially on 3rd shift. I believe the source of the haunting to be
in the livng room/parlor and down west hall in the main part of the building.
The parlor is dedicated to the grandmother of the administrator and contains a
photo of the woman and some of her furniture, including an old organ and
grandfather clock. This is a room most employees do not like to enter alone,
especially when dark. I have seen an apparition of this woman and have heard
the organ play on it's own. Though it can seem creepy, I believe the spirit to
be harmless, as this woman was the first nurse in their family and maybe this
is where her final happiness in live rests. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I have only had a few experiences with this.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It first happened when I was about 15 or 16
and I went on vacation<span style="">&nbsp; </span>with my best
friend and her parents.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">We stayed a night at her parents friends house in the <st1:City><st1:place>Los
  Angeles</st1:place></st1:City> area.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">When we got there we put our stuff in the room we were going
to sleep in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I had to use the bathroom
and my friend sat on the bed to wait for me.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Then she had to use the bathroom.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As we passed eachother she gave me an odd look</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">but didn't say anything.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I sat on the bed and suddenly I got this weird</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">feeling that someone was watching me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I looked around the room but no one was
there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was really freaky.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When my friend came out she told me that she
had a weird feeling in this room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And I
told her the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We told her mom and
she said that it was their friends daughter's room but she died<span style="">&nbsp; </span>a long time ago.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well, we freaked and refused to stay the
night in that room.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">We slept in the living room and I swear all night the
chandelier (sp?) moved.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">This one is a sad one.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This happened my junior year in highschool.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was staying the night at my sister in
laws.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She got a phone call from her
cousin (she's just a year older than me).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She was upset because her friend was just killed in a drunk driving
accident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When my sister in law got off
the phone and told me, I saw a flash of a friend of mine's face in my mind
(whom her cousin would have known too).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She didn't know the name of her cousins friend.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A little later that night we went to where
her cousin worked to rent a video and I asked her who it was.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She said his name and it was my friend who
flashed in my mind.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I did not take this
very well.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I never had lost a friend
before.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I cried all the time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One or two nights later I had a dream.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was sitting in my mom's car in the parking
lot of the retired home where my grandma lived.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I looked out the window and saw my friend who was killed, skateboarding
(this was something he did) in the next parking lot over. I was so excited I
jumped out of the car and ran over to him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I asked him what he was doing and that I thought that he was dead.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I tried to hug him but he wouldn't let
me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He said that I couldn't hug him
anymore.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was just there to say
goodbye I guess.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I woke up and Im not
sure if that dream ever really made me feel better but I really think that he
came to me in my dream.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The next time was when I was 19.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My boyfriend (now husband) was at my house</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">one night.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My
parents were sleeping and we were watching TV in the living</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I needed to get
something out of my room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was near the
closet bending over and I swear my boyfriend was sneaking up behind me.
Thinking he was going to scare me, I figured I would turn around and scare him
first.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I swung around and was about to
say something but no one was there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
curtain, all the way across the room, moved like someone moved passed it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I ran as fast as I could down the hall, back
to the living room and my boyfriend was just sitting there watching TV. He
swore he didn't go to my room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was
just after my grandma had died.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
believe it was her.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">As much as I think I would like to experience maybe seeing a
family member or friend's spirit, I'm not sure how I would handle it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I think I will just be content with the
experiences that I've had.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I very much
believe though.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Church Organist</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: hollowgirl_73@yahoo.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">This expierence did not happen to me but It was a story that
was told to me by my father that happened to his best friend. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The church i'm about to tell you about is a church i went to
with my parents when i was a child it is said to be haunted and i believe it
is. My father's best friend worked a night shift at a nearby mill in a town
called South Boston V.A. He loved motorcycles so he owned one a road it to work
everynight. On his way to work he had to ride by a church which was the church
i attended as a child but please note i was not born at the time of this, this
took place at my guess in the 60's being that i was not born until the 70's i
never got to meet my fathers best friend but as the story goes. My fathers best<span style="">&nbsp; </span>friend named Winston Harding<span style="">&nbsp; </span>traveled the lonely church road every night
on his way to work alot of nights he noticed the sainturaty light on at
night<span style="">&nbsp; </span>his first thought was someone is
not turning the lights off at night after choir practice. Mr. Harding kept a
eye on the church everynight to see how much the light was being left on and
noticed it was more on wednesday nights than others so he decided to call the
preacher and tell him the choir director must be leaving the lights on after
practice on wednesday. The preacher told him he would remind the choir director
about the lights and thanked Mr.Harding for his concern and he told him if he
saw the light on anymore to please stop and turn them off so they would not be
wasting current.[ My father told me back in his time 50,s 60's most churches
kept there doors open not being the case these days and times.] Mr. Harding
agreed to stop and turn off the light if he saw it on again. Well th very next
night the light was left on again so Mr. Harding pulled his cycle into the
gravel lot of the church and after he had turned his motorcylce off he could
hear music coming from inside the church this really raised his suspisions
being there were no other vehicles but his cycle in the gravel lot. He went in
threw the main doors which were the saintuary doors and he then noticed it was
the <st1:City><st1:place>erie</st1:place></st1:City> sound of the organ playing
and as he looked toward the organ there was a lady in a lavender gown sitting
playing the organ. Mr. Harding called to her but she did not answer or look his
way so he moved closer and called out again she still played not noticing his
present now he was getting a little nervous so he moved even closer but careful
because he did not know what kind of fruit cake he was dealing with. He yelled
loudly at her and she stoped playing and slowly stood up and turned toward him
and he could see this was not a healthy human woman her face was deformed on
one side like it had been burnt badly. she never spoke or even flinched just
looked at him. He decided then there was no time for further investigations so
he stepped back a few steps and turned around and ran like a bat out of hell to
his motorcycle. He had told my father he was so scard that he was frozen in the
church and he doesn't even know if he was even breathing at the time when she
turned toward him. Mr Harding called the preacher as soon as he got to his work
and told him what had just happened. The preacher did not know how to respond
but only said the lady you described was the churches organ player,many many
years ago I just started preaching at the church and only knew her briefly she
played the organ beautifully and was very dedicated member., but that lady had
died right after i started my ministery there she had cancer and it had spread
over her and had affected one side of her face. The preacher told him she was
buried in a lavender gown because he preached her funeral and he can re mber it
very well. Mr Harding was killed on his motorcycle not long after the sighting
on the same road as the church, right infront of the church in a very sharp
curve. It is said to this day that the lights are still left on some nights and
the lady in the lavender gown still plays the organ for her church.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">There have been alot of stories about the church i can
remember people saying they did not like to be left alone in the church. They
could here doors opening, shutting footsteps <st1:City><st1:place>erie</st1:place></st1:City>
feelings along the halls. I know this for a fact because it happened to me not
long ago The church called my father and wanted him to buff the floors for a
homecoming this past may and wanted us to clean the church up. I was helping my
father and went into the choir room where they keep there robes and a piano i
was dusting cobwebs. I pressed a few keys on the piano just playing around like
most of us do when one is around i then dusted somemore and as soon as i walked
out the door the piano played a few notes on its own i turned around and did
not see anyone. I still think about that wondering if it was just the old keys
on the piano or was it more!!!!<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">When I was about five years old, my family moved into a
house in <st1:place><st1:City>Omaha</st1:City>, <st1:State>Nebraska</st1:State></st1:place>
that was built in 1934. Upon entering the house, I immediately picked out a
room. Everything was fine until I was six. About four nights every week, I
would wake up in the middle of the night screaming at about the same time. My
mom would often lay down with me to make sure I fell asleep. One night she
awoke at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="3">3 AM</st1:time> to hear a noise as
though someone was flicking open a news paper. She never revealed this to me
after we moved out of that house. My younger sister's b-day is Halloween(sounds
corney). anyways I would wake to hear the back door bell ringing, even though
to be able to ring the door bell, you had to get through a locked storm door.
That happened every night leading up to Halloween. Later when my parents were
talking to our elderly neighbor, he said someone named Bob had died in that
house.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">This all started back in 1992 and every bit of what I am
about to tell you is true.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>when I was 11
years I awoke in the middle of the night (it was like 11:30 which seemed like
middle of the night back then) and for some reason I looked out my window and
in the back yard was a (for lack of a better word) a being it was glowing
yellow and it had the outline of a human skeleton but it had no legs and was
floating now being 11 and seeing this was a scary experience and this wasn't
the only sighting but the beginning of an epic encounter I continued to see
this "being" off and for the rest of that summer and then it just
stopped and thought that was the end of that but almost to the date the next
summer it was back and it was the same story and went on for the summer and same
the year before it was gone as quickly as it appeared but in 1994 it was a new
saga I was standing in my back yard and I noticed a yellowish fog or smoke
blowing into my yard and the being appeared out of the smoke and was standing
about 15 feet from me and I looked at it and it stared back at me then it just
disappeared that was the only time I saw it in '94 and thought that was the end
of my bizare sightings but two years later in '96 I was in Richmond VA. visting
my uncle and I got up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom and I
walked into the bathroom and as I glanced out the window I saw the being this
time it had it's back to me and it started to turn slowly and as it did it had
beams of red light coming out of it's eyes and as it turned I ducked and the
beams came into the bathroom and reflected off the walls I don't want to know
what could have happen if I had been touched by those beams.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later that summer I was at my parents beach
condo in Nags He NC and i was up late watching TV and glanced out the window
and saw the being stand by the pool staring at me and just vanished and then 3
nights later I was standing on the stairway which lead to the beach and was
looking out at the ocean as it was the last night I was going to be there and as
I looked south down the beach I saw a yellow glow heading my direction and as
it got closer I could see it was the being and it just floated on by did not
even glance at me that was the last time I ever saw the being.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I do not what it was or what purpose it
served if any all I know is at the time it scared the hell outta me I really
don't care to see again or to find out what it was.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Well, to begin with I wasn't a believer in Ghosts . I was
the type that If you told me A story I wouldnt listen or actually believe.
We'll everything changed when something scary happened to me . It was New Years
Eve , I was getting ready in my room because i was going to my Aunts house.
We'll next to my room is the washroom and a small hallway . I was putting on
makeup , and had a strange feeling . But I ignored it. Not even 3 seconds past
and I was nervous. So I looked out of my room and saw a big dark shadow , It
was wearing a black suit , and its face was white but wierd like smoke like a
cloud . I know what I saw . People dont believe me . Ever since then I can't
sleep alone . My little brother moved in with me. And even so till this day I
feel like somebody watches me . When Im in the hallway at my house I feel
someone following me , and i start running of how scared I am . Maybe this
might have a connection to the other ghosts they said huanted my house. When we
moved my uncles and aunts said that they kept seeing things. But I didnt
believe them . Until one day we were cleaning my closet and we found a painting
of a beautiful women and a handsome man. They mustve been 23 - 26 of age. The
drawing was from 1913 . We showed my family the painting and said they saw a
lady in dress like that girl in the picture. Later we asked the lady that used
to live their if the picture was her . She said yes . That it was her great
grandmother , and she lived in the house we are living in now.So it might have
some connection .</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;</span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>About a year ago
my husband and I moved into a house that seemed like a dream for us. It was the
perfect price, had everything we were looking for and so much more. Soon,
however, after settling in we realized we weren't the only ones occupying the
house. It started out with small things that we could easily pass off as the
house settling or just our minds playing tricks on us. We would hear tapping on
the wall, foot steps, doors opening, ect. After a few months of hearing that it
kind of became suspicious so we began to investigate the noises. Everytime we
did, however, we came up empty handed. A few more months down the lines things
began to progress with the hauntings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
few of these moments that stick out most vividly in my head are as follows.
Every night before bed my husband and I would shut and lock the glass door,
then shut and lock the normal door before heading off to bed. One night my
husband got up around <st1:time minute="0" hour="0">midnight</st1:time> to get
me a drink of water and when he walked passed the front door both of the doors
were wide open, but still locked. Another incident was when we were painting
our bedroom and heard a huge crash in the livingroom, as if something glass
shattered into a thousand pieces. When we went to see what had broke nothing
was out of place and there wasn't a shattered piece of glass in sight. We
looked all over the house and still found nothing. We have an old garbage
disposal in my kitchen that doesnt work and is extremely difficult to open,
both my husband and myself have trouble opening it and it doesn't work so it's
never opened anyway. One morning we got up to find it wide open. Neither one of
us had opened it and no one else lives with us. We have had our dogs and cats
wake up in the middle of the night and started growling and hissing at thin
air. One of my dogs inparticular will often be seen staring up at the ceiling
for 10 minutes at a time, then suddenly raise the hair on his back and growl.
Our air conditioner stopped working one day, so we had to turn it off and the
house was boiling hot, but all of a sudden we heard a door slam and the house
got ice cold. We have an EFD that we use in the house and it goes into the red
and yellow zones quite often. There is no doubt in our mines that our house is
haunted. We do know that this ghost or ghosts are not trying to hurt us or
scare us away, just simply letting us know they are here.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Home Cleaning Service</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: mahuez1@mindspring.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">a year ago I took over a small home cleaning service for a
friend of mine who was moving. I added a few of my own clients including the
mother of my college room mate. The house is average, a bit smallish, but full
to the brim with collectables in every spot in every room. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I can not quite explain it but the house has a horrible
feeling. It just feels 'bad', something feels so very wrong, and just terrible
there. I forgot until last fall (after my first experience) that my room mate
had always told me she believed that her parents home was haunted due to
strange noises, sights and just an overall disturbing feeling she had always had
at that house. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Early last fall I was finishing up vacuuming in the large
living room and had my back to the long hall, the vaccum makes quite a bit of
noise and I should have not been able to hear much over it, but I did. I heard,
coming from the hallway it seems, a young girls laughter. But it was not
giggling pleasant laughter. It was a horrible, evil laugh. And 'behind' the
laugh I could hear what sounded like a guttaral whisper of a man. Very low and
indecipherable, but it chilled me to the bone. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I had the feeling that if I turned and looked I would see
something I would neve forget. I took a deep breath and whirled around but
there was nothing there but the dark hallway. I got out of there as fast as I
could. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">That was nearly 8 months ago and I had all but forgotten
about it, and had even gotten used to being in the house by myself for those 3
hours every other week, until yesterday. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I was quietly thrilled when the owner, a teacher and good
acquintance, would be home for the summer months and I would not be there by
myself. But she always feels she is in my way so she now plans errands around
my cleaning so she won't disturb me. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Not long after I had arrived yesterday she left. I had an
overabundance of that horrible feeling, which I had not really noticed in quite
some time. I kept hearing things that were simply out of place, just tiny
creaks and pops that just didn't fit anything. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Then while in the kitchen I heard a very loud and
unmistakable scratching at the side door. The door is virtually unreachable
from the outside as it is surrounded by flower beds and is never used, EVER.
But twice, same length, from top to bottom of the door a<span style="">&nbsp; </span>horrible scratching that was very loud. My
heart froze! and I realized belatedly that the doors I always keep locked were
not locked because the owner had been home when I got there. But I guess
whatever wants in will get there lock or not. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I was a mess and just trying to get out as fast as I could.
I was finishing up in a bedroom when I saw very disinctly a shadow move in the
room across the hall from the room I was in. It was a full length shadow, as if
a door were swinging in the room, but the closet door was jammed due to stuff
on either side pushed against it. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">At the same second I saw the shadow a phone in the room I
was in (no other phone in any other room, and they have at least a half dozen
phones) began to ring. It stopped after a couple of rings, but I realized that
the whole time I was there every time I would hear or think I saw something it
would immediately be followed by a ringing phone. I even thought about telling
the owner how her phone had rang constantly the whole time I was there. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I am closing the business in the next month, as I am about
to have a child. I can not wait to be rid of that house! Though I have no
intention of telling the woman taking the business from me about it, I don't
think anyone would volunteer to do it after that! I just hope she has more luck
seeing as how she cleans with a partner and not alone.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Thanks for letting me share.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Here are a couple of my ghost experiences with my dogs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>~Casey and Sasha~<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My dogs both have passed away in the past two
years, but yet, they still seem to linger here. Just to clear some thing up, I
kept my dogs collars when they died.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One
night while I was sleeping, I heard a sound of two dogs collars right beside my
bed I opened my eyes to see both of my dogs sitting on the floor staring at me.
While they were sitting there, I noticed that they were wearing their collars.
One nudged my arm and I went to pet her, but I fell asleep. The next morning, I
thought it was just a dream. So I pushed it a side. I walked up to my door
where thier collars used to hang, and to my suprise the collars where gone.I
looked all over for them, but they where no where to be found.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was really upset, because those where the
only things I left of my dogs. Well, I decided to take a walk and I happen to
walk past my two dogs' graves and there laying on the grave stone was their old
collars. Conquinceidence? I don't know.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The night after my dog Sasha died I was sitting in my kitchen crying
when I looked out the window and saw both of my dogs looking through the
window. I ran towards my window to them. But when I got there, they were gone.
This made me angry. This kept happening until recently, when I got a new dog to
ease my pain. Now, my old dogs play tricks on my new dog, it sounds wierd but
they do.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Well this story didn't happen to me but my dad has told me
this story many time's and just seems to never get around to submitting this
story so I guess I am. This story happens in Colinga,CA my dad was just a kid
about 10 to 12 years old growing up in a small town where everyone knows everyone
and not much happens much (except that big earth quake but that was years
afterwards). So one night my dad was trying to get to sleep but had troubles
now I'm relly not sure but maybe he had the idea he was being watched I dont
know but he opened his eyes for some reasion and saw a shadowy figure crouching
in the corner. My dad said it look like him self just crouching there watching.
So being a kid as most of you would of done he yelled out to his dad when his
dad came and turned the light on...nothing was there.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I lived in Caroline Co. VA for several years and ended up
buying a house off of rt 1.The real estate agent forgot to inform us that it
was on civil war grounds.One night my husband and I were sitting in the living
room when we both noticed a face in our kitchen window of a man with a beard
and cap on, he looked to be very tired.Chris jumped up and ran to the kitchen
door, but noone was there.Our window was slightly raised so you would have had
to stand on something to see in.By the time Chris got back in the house the
face was back.We eventually found out that during the war the South dug
trenches to suprise the North to keep them from getting to the North or South
Anna rivers.Our house was on one of the trenches,so we lived with our soldier
who we eventually named "Ed the head".</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Also when our daughter was born I put her in her room one
day, she started to cry so by the time I reached her she wasn't crying anymore
and her bassanet was rocking.The bassanet wasn't the type that rocked and she
was stairing into space and not responding to me.At the time she was only 3
weeks old so she couldn't be making herself move.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">If you ever want to know the truth about the barn where John
wilkes Booth was supposidly killed and then the barn burnt to the ground, you
should take a ride to the farn=m and see only 1 barn standing that fits the
description to a t is old and has a odd feeling about it.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">i have always thought the house that i have lived in has
been creepy, uncomfortable sorta aura about it. All of my nannys or au pairs
have thought the house has been haunted, I dont like to use the word ghost, I
think spirit is more appropriate. BUt over the years, i have had many different
experiences of varying degree. when i was ten i woke in the middle of the night
to the most intense terror i have ever felt in my life, i was completely paralysed
and my eyes could not shift from this unseeable but definitely sensable
presence at the top right corner of my room. it passed in say ten seconds but.
Ok then a lot of times i have had even when its hot, cold chills, just an
uncomfortable feeling, which could be me, but it is felt by anyone when alone
in the house. I was also listening to music with my cleaner, and she was like
this song doesn go with the rest of your mix, and simultaneously, as i was
looking at the cd player, the volume turned down, to zero, i was like why you
turn it off woman! an she was like i didn. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">so i go llook for the controler, its in the next room,
facing the wall, no way it coulda been used as we were alone in the house.
weird thing was we were both researching the houses history as we both feel
theres something up in this place, so maybe it was tryin to shit me up, i do
get scared, mainly when im stoned at night! but i feel more powerful than my
spirit, in a spiritual sense obviously. also since i bought my cross necklace,
when im chillin at night i feel this sorta<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>tuggin, niggling, just little movements like someone is tryin to pull my
necklace of really pathetically, and i have not been movin at all during these
times. no wind etc. im inside init!. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">could you make a judgement on what sorta spirtit this might
be, if at all. i believe so strongly tho. cos it doesn feel like a friendly
one. trust me. my dads hoouse by contrast has a friendly warm feeling despite
the grumpy bitch of a wife that lives there with him.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">My Haunted Experiences</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: TACAPOLLO@peoplepc.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I have always been a little 'sensitive' (or a magnet,
perhaps?) to spiritual encounters (some have been witnessed by others who were
with me).</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I had an apartment in Frostburg, while I was going to
college, where I frequently saw an apparition of a black woman (a maid?)
dressed in 1800's clothing) staring out the kitchen window (it was a large old
house that was converted into apartments, so I'm not sure if it was a kitchen
during her time). She never seemed to recognize my presence but would just fade
away after a few moments.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I then moved to <st1:City><st1:place>Cumberland</st1:place></st1:City>
where I lived in a number of places. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">One place I lived (I believe it was Grand Ave.-please allow
me to double check the exact places, if you plan on quoting me on this because
I've lived in a number of houses and this was about 25 years ago). I lived on
the second floor of a house (which also had the attic). It was a long, narrow
apartment that ran from the kitchen in back to the bedroom at the front of the
house. Every night around <st1:time minute="30" hour="2">2:30 AM</st1:time> I
would be wakened by the sound of heavy footsteps that started in the kitchen
and ended right about my bed. I went to check it out on several occasions. On
one was there and there was no way anyone (other than myself) could have possibly
been there!</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">After talking with some friends, I discovered that a girl I
knew, a photographer,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>had lived there
previously and, while taking a picture in the living room, one of the objects
she was shooting was suddenly thrown across the room.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Later I, and a group of friends, decided to reduce the rent,
we would move into an old house on Cumberland St. Days after getting the place,
I was there alone while they ran to pick up cleaning supplies. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">As I was exploring out this huge old house, I suddenly heard
the cry of a young boy. I can still hear it today "Help me, Mommy!"</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">It was coming from the stairwell (which ran up three flights
to the attic). I searched up and down the stairs but saw no sign of anyone. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Just then, the others arrived back to the house. As I told
the one girl what I had heard, she turned slightly pale and said that as they
were pulling up, Holly, another room-mate, said she saw a boy looking out the
attic window. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">This house was located about a half a block away from an old
cemetery (right behind Allegany High School-but I don't believe it was any sort
of High School prank or anything). Late one night I was walking home past the
cemetery. Out of the corner of my eye<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>(there were street lights and I recall it was a full/nearly full moon) I
saw a shadow that seemed to be coming down through the cemetery. This was an
old cemetery that allowed monuments and the above ground burial vaults and
stuff (not like the new ones where it's only a<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>plate on the ground so it's easy to mow over).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As I walked, the figure seemed to be moving
faster, darting between the monuments and statues. I picked up my pace (mind
you, there was only a waist high iron fence separating the sidewalk from the
graveyard. Finally, I panicked and took off running for my house as fast as my
legs would take me.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I moved shortly after.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Then I moved to a house on <st1:Street><st1:address>Decatur
  St.</st1:address></st1:Street> , another second floor apartment. &gt;From the
start, there was a constant issue with doors opening and slamming closed and
things like that. I<span style="">&nbsp; </span>also decided to adopt
a kitten. I got about three kittens and each one died within weeks. Finally, I
talked to the neighbors, and they say that the house had been owned by an old
lady named Lucy who was fairly mean. Taking one more risk, I got another
kitten, named it Lucy, and it lived to a ripe old age, plus the door slamming
seem to stop.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My "haunted" experiences settled down after that
point. There was one incident where I had to walk from Lonaconing to <st1:City><st1:place>Cumberland</st1:place></st1:City>
(a long dark road) late one night with a friend. It became scary when (1 or <st1:time minute="0" hour="2">2 AM</st1:time>) a growl was heard just off the roadside.
Although the moon was out, we couldn't see anything, but it followed us for
miles until we reached the intersection blinking lights of a cross road).</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Now that I live here in <st1:place><st1:City>Fairmont</st1:City>,
 <st1:State>WV</st1:State></st1:place> , this has all stopped..almost. In this
house, now I get an occasion touch or tap on my shoulder, when no one is
around. Not sure what it means, but there has sure been a number of people who
have died next door. In fact, after the lady next door died (whose only passion
in life was TV) I 've seen the glow of her television through the living room
window for<span style="">&nbsp; </span>months after she (and the

<p class="MsoNormal">I'm not doing this for myself or publicity, in fact,
sometimes it makes me wonder about my own sanity...but there are others there
who have witnessed the same or experienced similar, so I don't feel like I'm
completely bonkers.</p>

 <st1:PlaceName>Youth</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType>Academy</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>)
and have been here for almost 9 years. I have seen shadows walking down the
halls, heard foot steps walking up and down the stairs. Showers and sinks come
on all on their own. Fans turn on that was unplugged. I sat with a friend one
night and watch the lights in bldg 310 turn on several times after telling my
platoon sergeant to turn them off several times. I have seen shadows in the
windows looking out, late at night. The young boy you referred to was an orphan
during his time here. The story is he was killed by a janitor in bldg 307 and
still walks the halls of that bldg. I have heard people talking in the
buildings. The auditorium on post is also said to be haunted. One of my friends
who work there was locking up one night and heard voices coming from the
auditorium and went in to look and no one was present, as he was leaving he
heard foot steps walking behind him on the stage, again no one was there.
Orderlies have been seen pushing a gurney across the grounds with the dead on
top. There are all kinds of stories of this place and I could keep going. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Hi, I was at your site, and I really like it. My dad and I
are paranormal detectives, and we look at everything and anything
scary/haunted. This is not my encounter, but my cousins and his freind's
encounter. Here it is. My cousin is in high school and he had his friend over
in the middle of the night. They were watching a movie or shows or something
and my cousin's friend, Mark, went upstairs to get some soda and chips. Then,
my cousin heard, "Hey Luke! Come here!" He went to check what Mark
was yelling about. "Oh my gosh, what the heck is that?" said my
cousin, Luke. At the top of the stairway was an orb with a greenish glow.
"Oh my word." said Mark. All of a sudden, the orb flies through Mark.
Mark all of a sudden collapses right when the orb exited his body. The orb went
down to the bottom of the stairs and vanished completely. Mark was okay, so he
stood up, but he was shaking. "I'm getting out of here!" said Mark.
"This is nuts!" Luke and Mark ran up the stairs, out the front door,
and down to Mark's house. It is said that a man that lived there long ago was
brutally murdered at the top of the stairs by a crazed killer. To this day, we
still don't know if this murder thing is true, but the ghost was surely there.
The orb still appears from time to time there.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">One Sunday Afternoon</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: corgiluv22@yahoo.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">One Sunday afternoon, I was taking my dog for a walk at my
favorite park. I love this particular park because it is adjacent to a large
church and the park itself has about 50 acres surrounding a lake. Around the
lake wraps a 3 mile paved pathway, on the outer reaches of the path are woods. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Anyway, as we walked down the path I noticed that for such a
lovely sunny day, there was barely anyone there besides me and my dog. I
noticed another walker on the path, but she was far across the lake on the
other side. We were rounding a corner of the path that is more densely
surrounded by woods when suddenly I was jerked to an abrupt halt by my dog. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">At first I thought he stopped to use the bathroom or caught
a scent of the ducks in the lake&#8212;that is until I turned around. When I looked
at him, he was sitting on the pavement refusing to go further. He sat on the
ground like dead weight and sprawled his legs. I began to get irritated and
tugged at him and he refused to move&#8212;his collar nearly came off. That is when I
noticed that his eyes were wide in fear and he looked absolutely terrified. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Suddenly, there was a strong breeze and he put his nose in
the air and sniffed the air furiously, looking around nervously. Immediately, I
began to get very scared.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anyone who
knows anything about Corgi&#8217;s knows they are a very bold breed. They don&#8217;t scare
easily at all. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Thinking someone was hiding behind a bush ready to jump out,
I started looking around frantically. I scanned the open field in the distance,
and the only thing I saw were 2 prairie dogs about 2 acres out, standing and
sniffing the air, and then for some odd reason, they rapidly ran for their
life. Then a cluster of small birds and ducks flew away quite abruptly. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">At this point, I thought, there had to be a coyote (we have
many coyotes in <st1:State><st1:place>Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>) and I
better get back to the path closer to the church and away from the woods. I
reversed back right away. My dog was more than happy to turn around and was
pulling the leash so hard that he was choking and hyperventilating. As we
rushed away, I looked to my left because something across the fields, deep in
the woods caught my eye. I did a double take and froze. About 2 acres out, I
saw a &#8220;blacker than black&#8221; mass shaped like a small person&#8212;a dwarf. It features
were blacked out, it had no clothes, but it had a humanoid shape. I remember it
had distinct pointy ears and wrinkled kneecaps. It backed up slowly into the
denser part of the woods, all the while watching me. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The hairs on the back of my neck stood up as I stopped
short. I was so astonished that I stood still for a few moments then ran and
didn&#8217;t stop until we reached the outskirts of the church. My heart was racing
insanely Once we got there, I scanned the woods from atop a hill and didn&#8217;t see
anything. I looked feverishly for a good 5 minutes trying to see where the
thing had gone.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I have no idea what the dwarf shape was. I have not seen it
since, but I will always be looking over my shoulder for it. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I swear this is a 100% true story that scared the heck out
of me. I didn&#8217;t add details to sensationalize the story either. If anyone has
had any similar experiences, or knows what I saw, please feel free to drop me
an email. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">MY beloved sister was diagnosed with cancer 10 years ago and
died at the time the Doctor's predicted she would. Her cancer (at the last) had
spread everywhere, and<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was told it
also had invaded her brain. She had lucid days, and other days she was
"out of it". During two of her lucid days, she called me to her
bedside and told me she wanted to tell me something, but both times as she was
starting to speak to me, she forgot what she had wanted to say. I said what did
you want to tell me, and she replied she couldn't remember.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She not long after lapsed into a coma and
died....with out ever telling me what she wanted to. About a week after her
funeral, I was home alone, and as I was watching television, I glimpsed
something out of the corner of my eye, as I turned my head to see what it was,
I saw an end table with a lamp on it<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>radiating up and down...radiating is the only way I can explain what I
saw, I of course blinked my eyes, and looked away over to the couch just to
make sure I wasn't having an attack of some sort, and the couch area was
normal, so I knew I wasn't stroking out, or having some sort of eye problem...
but as I looked back at the table , it was radiating still...it lasted for a
few moments then stopped. The sight was as close as I can describe it to say ,
you know when you are driving on a hot day, and you look far ahead off in the distance
and you can see the heat radiate from the pavement upwards, and to me that is
what this looked like. In your opinion , was this a spirit I saw? I felt it was
her trying once more to contact me. maybe to tell me once again what she wanted
to say. I have never had the experience again, but I do get mental images of
her as she was before she became ill. Reply to me please,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>if you will and tell me what you think it
was...</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>My daughter talks in
her sleep everynight. She has dreams everynight, sometimes waking up in the
middle of the night sweating and screaming. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I have caught her walking in the hallway and I've called her
name and talked to her her and she will walk into her bedroom and go back to
bed. I have </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">stood at her door many times and listen to her have
conversations with someone. She laughs, and talks, tells whoever it is about
her family and I thought</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">maybe she has a imaginary friend. My mother asked her who
she was talking to, and she told my mother that she was talking to her dad (
great grandfather )</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">and he died when she was just a baby. My daughter tells me
that she talks to " uncle Jack" which is my mothers brother... and he
died in 1972. My daughter </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">was born in 1999. Sometimes it scares me. Sometimes I feel
happy that she may be talking with our family who is already passed. Im just so
confused and I </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">wonder if they are trying to tell us something through her.
My uncle that she talks about died in a car accident, and was believed to be
racing with another car, </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">who bumped him causing him to wreck, and left the scene.
What if he is trying to tell her something? The last thing that happened with
her, was the scariest.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My sister in law's brother passed away in a car accident,
and about a month before my daughter went out to eat with him and his daughter
and some other family </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">members. I know how she gets when people die, so I didn't
take her to the funeral but I did explain what happened. A couple of weeks
later we went out to see the </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">tombstone. The day we went out to see it, it was hot and
sunny. She kept saying what a nice man he was while we were standing there. I
told her we better go, </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">and I started walking back to the car, and all of a sudden
it got real dark, the sun was gone, the wind was blowing leaves all over the
cemetary, and it got chilly. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I turned around, and my daughter was standing there staring
at the tombstone with this weird look on her face, and I called out to her. She
continued to stand there staring, I walked over and grabbed her hand and called
her name. She looked up at me and it was like she got pulled from where she
was. Her expression changed </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">back to normal and she smiled and asked me where we were
going. I made her get in the car and I sat there and cried. I am still wondering
if he was talking to her or </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">something. When I<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>called her name the sun came back out and the wind stopped. She asked me
in the car. " mommy, whats wrong? " because I just kept crying and</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">wiping my face. I told her, you know that when someone dies
it makes people sad. She said " mommy, who died"? It freaks me out
sometimes...... </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I never believed in ghosts or spirits until 2 nights ago. My
friends were talking about haunted places &amp; the closest to us that is still
around is <st1:Street><st1:address>Marrow Road</st1:address></st1:Street> in
Algonac. So we decided to go check it out. Couldnt find the road lead alone the
bridge so i came home &amp; found out the story &amp; info on your page
mapquested Starville &amp; Marrow Road &amp; go directions. We couldnt find the
bridge &amp; thought it was blocked off after crossing over another street. Not
the case. Not finding the bridge we just decided to stop on the road &amp; try
it. A few minutes later waiting for <st1:time minute="0" hour="0">midnight</st1:time>,
we saw another car turn on the road &amp; turn their lights off. Knowing they
were doing the same thing. We honked 3 times at nidnight, nothing. Watching the
other car we saw their lights go on &amp; off 5 times. So we turned around
&amp; they started driving. Flagged them down &amp; asked, we discovered we
passed over the bridge numerous times because it is well hidden w/ grass,
weeds, etc. We asked what the did &amp; they said they turned off their car,
stepped on the brakes 3 times, honked the horn 3 times &amp; everyone gets
outta the car chanting "we got your baby" &amp; the driver puts the
keys on the car. Their lights went on &amp; off 2 times &amp; the car made a
funny noise. So we went back last night &amp; did exactly what they said to.
When we got out, the lights went on &amp; off and me not believing, i asked who
had the keys in their hand, next thing we knew the keys were lightly hit on the
top of the car to move them a few inches. I flipped out &amp; got back in the
car. No ghost, no baby, no lady in a dress. And we think the "green
light" may be fireflys. Gets really dark out there &amp; you see them all
over. (green glow) Anyone wants to know where the bridge is, its a pain to find
so on maoorow rd. heading south, just past <st1:Street><st1:address>Angling Rd.</st1:address></st1:Street></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Ghosts Haunt My House</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: bottlekittie@yahoo.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">my house is very old, it was built around the times of
slavery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the previous owners have tried
to perserve the house and lot to be historicaly correct.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>there are still the bells around the house
that were used to be used to call the slaves, and there are still the slaves
quarters (a small run-down little cabin in the back of the yard in a grove of
trees).<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">i live with my husband, 9 year old son, and our dog.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>we have seen several sightings of ghosts
around the property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the first sighting
was when we had just moved into the house.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>it was<span style="">&nbsp; </span>only one or two months
after we bought it, and we were literally spending our first few weeks in the
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>back then, (12 years ago), we
didn't have<span style="">&nbsp; </span>our son, and we hadnt gotten
our dog yet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>so, the house was only
occupied by me and my husband.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>we slept
in a smaller one of the rooms (there are 5 bedrooms, 2 of which are masterbed
rooms.)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>as i said, a lot was preserved
in the house, and many of the rooms still had original windows, and paintings
on the walls. even some of the plates on shelves were the old ones.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>our bedroom was one of the rooms that had
it's original windows, and they were very bumpy and a bit chipped.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>next to our bed was a large window that
looked out into the garden.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>there was a
small crack that ran down the left corner of the window.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>niether of us paid much attention to the
wirethin crack.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that night though, i was
rolled on my side, and i had a clear vision of the crack.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>i fell asleep, but after a while i remember
feeling like someone was nudging my shoulder, so i turned to my husband, but he
was asleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>i tried to fall asleep
again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>i felt like it could just have
been my dream.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>but a few seconds later,
i felt it again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>i rolled and could see
clearly that it wasn't my husband.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>when
i rolled over again, the first hing i saw was the crack in the window.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the crack seemed to have extended, and it
looked like it formed the outline of a face.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>as i watched, i could see the outline sortof, filling in with more
details.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>two eyes, a nose, ears, a
mouth, so on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>i stared as it seemed to
become more lifelike.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>i was so scared,
all that i could do was gape at it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>once
it had finished it's detail, the face twisted into a sortof expression like it
was terrified, and it's mouth opened, i felt like it was about to scream.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>i must have gone to sleep sometime, becuase
the next thing that happened was that my husband woke me up, saying that i screamed,
and that he thought i had a fever.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>i
told him about it, and im sure he believed me, even though in the morning, the
face had dissapeared.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">the next 3 hauntings were all pretty simaler.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>they happened very spread out over the next 9
years, over my son, Ben's life.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>when Ben
was born, my husband and i made the move from the small bedroom into one of the
masterbedrooms on the third floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the
first haounting when Ben was alive was when he was 2 years old.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>he had been taking a nap, it was about 4 in
the afternoon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ben was not a big screamer
baby, so when he began to scream at the top of his lungs, i came running into
his room from the garden where i had been planting bulbs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>when i came into his room, there was
something that was hovering near the window.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>i wasn't sure exactly what it was at first, it looked like a creamyish
white orb.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>it wasn't exactly circular,
there was a point, sortof like a nose, or an ear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>it just hovered there, very transparet, by
the window at first when i came in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>i
was so terrifiyed, i just stood there.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>then i noticed what was going on, and grabbed my son and ran out of the
room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>luckily, Ben wasn't scarred after
a few minutes, but i still had my husband go into his room and make sure it was
gone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>he went in, and to all of ou
relief, the ghost had dissapeared.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">three years later, we had mostly forgotten about the
experiences, we had sortof passed them off.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>my husband told me this story.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>he
was mowing the lawn, and he happened to be going right up to the slaves
quarters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>he had earplugs in, so he
couldn't hear anything.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>but he felt a
bump, and saw glass fly out from below the mower.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>quickly, he turned it off, and checked to see
what it was.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>saw that it was actually a
glass bottle, and he thought it looked like an old fasioned medicine
bottle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>only part of it was broken, and
he said that when he held it up to the light, to get a better look at it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>in the top of the bottle, a dustly, sortof
ghostly looking orb appeared, but he said that it looked like it was a face.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>he said that it seemed to fly out of the
bottle once he threw it down in shock.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>he said that it floated out of the bottle, but stopped for a second when
it was at about eye height with him, and after a few seconds dissapeared.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">the last sighting that we had was when my son was 8, and he
was helping my husband do the dishes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>i
was getting ready to walk my dog, putting his leash on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>we were in the kitchen, and the door seemed
to blow open, even though there didn't feel like any wind actually blew
in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>a ghostly looking hand shape grasped
the top of the door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>nobody moved for a
few seconds (including the hand), but then, my dog began to bark at the hand,
and Ben ran from the room screaming.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the
hand then slipped from the top of the door, and dissapeared.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">my husband and i talked to the previous owners, (an elderly
couple who moved into an assistant living home,) and they said that they had
seen the ghost 4 or 5 times, and it was scary at first, but they didn't think
it would ever do harm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>my family still
lives in the house today, and we aren't planning to move.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I have always tryed to surround myslelf with hauntings. I
try to visit haunted places and old unused places as much as possible. I am so
olddly interested in trying to see somthing "unnatural". Ive been
searching for the "old confederate graveyard" somwhere near joe pool
lake in <st1:place><st1:City>Grand Prairie</st1:City>, <st1:State>Texas</st1:State></st1:place>.
I havnt found it yet but one night while searching for it I came across the
"estes graveyard" (both of the places are on this website in
"haunted places"). the estes graveyard was a very cold place. i felt
nothing and didnt see or hear anything. about 10 minutes after getting there I
got the strangest feeling that i should leave. I cannot explaine it. I didnt
want to go and if the feeling wasnt so strong i would have stayed there another
20 minutes but i was so inspired to leave for some reason. so i walked quickly
to my car. a split second after i turned on the main road, I saw a cop car come
around the corner. as I looked onto my rear view mirror, I saw the cop turn
onto the dirt road that dead ends to the estes cemetary. I wouldnt have been
sure wheather the cop was ment for me if it handnt been for the strong feeling
i felt. It was like an inspiration from no one. Like an unheard suggestion. and
the more i stayed, the more stronger it got as if it was demanded in a foul
language in the end. Im pretty sure I know who called the cops. when you first
turn on this long dirt road, to the left there about 50 yards are new built two
story houses. you can only see the back of them but thats my only guess as to
who called them. unless theres some sort of "graveyard keeper" (im
guessing thats what you call them). I cant wait for my next visit to the
cemetary. I feel a spirit was helping me and I will search for that kind spirit
again.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Here is just one of a few of my wierd happenings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Back in 1989 I was living with my dad, my
brother and my dads girlfriend and her two daughters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My bedroom at the time was in the basement
(finished basement).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well I turned the
main larger room into my bedroom which meant that if you came down the stairs
you basically walked into my bedroom although the room spanned the entire
length of the front of my house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My room
was on the right side of the stairs, and if you turned left you can go around
the corner into the laundry room ( not visible from my room).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But anyhow, I was asleep one night and woke
up for some reason in the middle of the night.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As I woke up I was laying on my left side and started to turn over when
I noticed all of the basement lights were on.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At that same time a man was standing at the foot of my bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I could not see through him as he was not
just a shadowy figure, he looked as if he were alive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We made eye contact and he turned around and
headed for the laundry room and just before he entered the laundry room he
stopped and turned to look at me once again for just a second.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As he walked away I didn't hear anything from
his movements not a sound.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now this is
not the strangest part, (and by the way all of this happened in a matter of 10
to 20 seconds).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the man disappeared
into the laundry room I went right back to sleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was not scared nor did I have a reaction of
any kind to this strange happening.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well
now the story gets even stranger.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As i'm
asleep I start to tell myself in a panic that I need to wake back up because
there was someone at the foot of my bed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I wake up suddenly and it is now <st1:time minute="0" hour="10">10am</st1:time>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The sun is shining and I noticed the basement
lights are still on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I get out of bed
and go upstairs and sat at the kitchen in deep thought as to what
happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Everyone was awake and my dad
came into the kitchen and saw that I was in deep thought about something and
asked what was wrong.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I told him about
what had happened and he started to just freak out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well come to find out he woke up around 3am
and thought for sure he had heard someone talking in the kitchen, but he knew
we were all sleeping.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So he woke my
older brother up and they began to search the house to find out who was
talking.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well they searched everyroom
including closets, doors , windows to see if we had an intruder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They found nothing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even the screen doors were locked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only place they didn't search was the
basement and they didn't turn the lights on!<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Someone or something was trying to tell us something but we dont know
what.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I never saw him again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I have since moved from that house where I have plenty more
stories but I will save them for another time!!<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If anyone wants to reply to me about this story...feel free.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">1. Upstairs Haunting</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">A few years ago me and my mom went up to the store to get
somethings. When we came back the front door was wide open, but that door was
always locked. We thought it was a burgler or something, but a year later, that
exact date. I sat in the living room when these bounding foot steps came flying
down the stairs. I screamed and jumped up, but nothing was there, but the door
flew open. That's when I knew it was a spirit of some sort. This was a week
before each Halloween that these happened</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">2. The Shower</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">It was my first year in our new house. One night I went to
take one of my many showers as normal. No one was home and the bathroom door
was locked, as was everything in the house. My elbow hit the shower curtain as
I was about to turn off the water. The figure of a small hand reached threw the
curtain and I screamed. I pulled back the curtain, but there was nothing there.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">3. The Dog</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I was in the kitchen with my mom one night. Our black dog
Wicked had died a week ago. As we where talking about her, the shadow of a
black dog stood in the shadows. I jumped up and it was gone as fast it came.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">4. The Broked Glass</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I was spending the night at my grandparents house with my
parents. We had just came back from my uncle's funeral. It was late at night
and my Grandpa was joking about how he was probably with him. Still angry at my
Grandpa for a fight they had had the night before he died. As they said that, a
glass of water from the middle of the table went flying across the room and
shattered against the wall.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">True Ghost Stories Experienced by Me</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: gailbanfield@yahoo.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">i have experienced what i would call sightings and
happenings since i was about 5 or 6 years old. my first experience, that i can
remember was Right after my paternal grandparents died. my grandmother died the
same month that john f kennedy died. my grandfather died six months later. my
grandparents fought alot so my grandmother would stay overnight at our house
when they fought. she slept in my bed with me. i only vaguely remember this.
years later when i<span style="">&nbsp; </span>became a teenager i
would ask my mother questions about my grandparents. she told me that after my
grandmother died my grandfather lived with us for the last 6 months of his
life.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">soon after my grandfather died i went to a store with my
dad. i remember being in the toy department looking at toys while my dad went
into another department to buy paint. i remember looking over to where my dad
was suppose to be. But as my eyes traveled over the outside furniture
department i saw both my grandparents standing on a platform that was
displaying lawn furniture. they looked at me. i remember wanting to run to my
dad and tell him that i saw them but didn't because i knew he was sad because
they had recently died. i have never seen them since.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">i don't recall anything else happening until i was about 18.
my parents had divorced when i was younger and my dad had moved to
Massachusetts.I lived in nj. I went to visit my dad for the weekend. he had a
really big walk in closet that had two doors. one connecting to the bedroom the
other one connecting to the bathroom. each room also had another entrance.
during the night i had to go to the bathroom. when i got up from the bed and
started walking towards the closet i saw a transparent shape. it was silvery
and sparkely.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">it din't touch either the top of the door or the bottom.it
didn't look like a person. just a shape as big as a person. i was surprised
tosay the least. i closed my eyes and went through it . it didn't feel like
anything. when i opened my eyes again it was gone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>a few months later i went again to my dads.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">this time i was going to be alone for a few days. my dad was
on a cruise and i was going to relax and enjoy the solitude until he came back.
the minute i got there i closed both doors to the walkin closet.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">nothing happened. my dad came back and he couldn't open the
closet door from the bedroom.i told him i closed it it was probably locked. my
dad looked at me and said there is no lock on the door.he had to take the door
off the hinges to fix it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>about a year
later i was in a car with friends . It was january and it was a pretty cold
night. my friend was driving and as i was watching the road alittle boy about 9
walked into the road. he was walking his dog. i yelled for my friend to st look
out. but she didn't see anything and kept driving. the next day i was telling
my frinds cousin about it and she started asking me questions. up unti that
point i hadn't given it much thought. she asked me to describe the boy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>i said he was about 9 . he had on a red and
white striped short sleeved shirt and<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>shorts. brown hair and he was walking a brown dog on a leash. after i
told her that i looked at her and said but its winter anf its cold outside...
nothing much happened for about ten years,<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>i was now living in my present home.i was living with my then husband
and our two little boys.. they were 2 and 4 at the time.they shared a room
and<span style="">&nbsp; </span>they had gone to sleep hours before.
my husband and i had a fight about something so i went to sleep on the couch. i
was laying there for about 15 minutes when i heard two little girls giggling in
my ear.they sounded about 6 or 7 years old. i knew it wasn't my boys but i went
to check any way. they were sound asleep. needless to say i went back to sleep
in the bedroom with my husband... Years later when i was divorced<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and my boys were about 12 and 14 i was on the
computer. the kids were asleep and the two same little giggling girls giggled
from my computer.beleive me i will never forget their giggles.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">i stood up and backed against the wall .I slid along the
wall till until i was out of sight of the computer. i checked on my two kids.
sound asleep. i went back to the computer and shout off the power and went into
my bedroom.a few hors later i awoke to go to the bathroom. as i opened the
bedroom door the computer turned on all by itself. since then my boys are now
18 and 20. i now have had sightings and happenings at my job and more
frequently at home. i will tell them some other time<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Yes, it's me again...</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">But this time it's not really a ghost story, but rather a
warning to be very careful as to what you sketch on your walls.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I was 18 at the time, and my Gramma and I were the only ones
living in the house, as the rest of my family had moved out.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My Gramma said that I could paint my room any color or
pattern I wanted, as long as she could paint over it if she decided to sell it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well, I agreed and started to draw what I
called my "dream closet" on the West wall.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I had everything drawn from the door with diagonal stripes
going two different directions, trading direction in the middle of the door, to
the Egyptian styled eye inside a faceted gem, to the clouds over the rest of
the surface, and Dream Closet above and to the North of the door.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The only thing I had not sketched was the door knob, I
couldn't find the one I liked.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Well, for 3 nights running, and always at <st1:time minute="0" hour="3">3am</st1:time>, I would hear clawing coming from the
wall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At first I thought it was the
vermin my Gramma told me about, but when my cat didn't twitch a whisker at the
sound, I kinda knew something was up.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">On the third night, I did what I yell at horror movie actors
to never do.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I got out of bed, walked to
the wall with my hand outstretched and placed my palm on the wall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And I kid you not, what happened next was
pure adreanal terror... I felt claws go over my palm through the wall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well, I made it all the way to my bed from the
far wall in one leap, and pulled the covers over my head and just shook.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The next day I painted the room solid purple, because I knew
without a doubt that I had opened a portal to another place, and if I had
finished the sketch with putting on a door knob, that something was going to
come through.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And I would be damned if I
was going to let anything happen to my Gramma.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My sister now lives in the house, and as of yet has had no
experiences.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Truth...</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">My name is <st1:City><st1:place>Nancy</st1:place></st1:City>

in a house built in 1904. Just a few things I seen; heard and felt---are the
following. On more than one occassion in the morning just as the sun rose a
sound like a huge stack of book's being dropped on the floor; sometimes the
smell of smoke or excretement out of the blue; one time I'd just gotten into
bed and a sound like a bunch of people whispering real fast next to my left
ear; once I was laying on the couch and heard like tiny feet running down the
wall and felt it run across my chest; I've had water poured on my feet and my
feet tickled; I've woken up and all my blankets were folded into a neat pile on
the bedroom floor; I,ve seen a toothbrush float zig-zaggedly down to the floor
and sound like a stack of books when it reached the floor;<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I've seen oranges float in the air; I;ve seen
a black shadow walk by that went clear up to the ceiling; and I saw a double
picture frame slowly close up---and making the sound of a squeaky barn
door....and when it opened back up it made the same sound--and then jet black
circles apppeared around the eyes for a minute. I've seen people shapes
anywhere from colored to barely visible brown-----and I've seen a black cloud
float across a kitchen floor and go into the openiong of a vaporizer!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And there's many other things that I have
experienced! Needless to say I spent many night's sleeping with my bedroom
lights on! Ant needless to say every place I have lived since--there are
paranormal happenings! Not just to me but also my whole family!</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The Handprint</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: Chelsea and Alex</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">One day while staying at my friend Alex's house we three
(me, alex, and her mom) decided to go to a cemetery while driving home from the
carwash. During the drive to the cemetery we decided to drive a little further
past the it. We drove not even four feet past a little dirt road before her mom
stopped and told us that she had never noticed that road before. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Immediately we decided we wanted to go down it. So her mom
backed up and turned down the road. We were getting a little freaked out, we
didn't know why we just were...The road was very narrow,so we looked for a spot
to turn around. About five miles down the road we spotted an abandoned barn. We
quickly turned in. Her mom stopped the car and looked further down the road.
She said that she saw something I caught on and told Alex I saw it, too. Even
though we were joking her mom and I really did see something. Then about twenty
seconds after claiming she had seen something her mom let out a ear-piercing
scream. Alex jumped so high of her seat she hit her head on the roof of the
car. I screamed so loud my throat hurt. Her mom stomped on the gas pedal. Then
she started laughing Alex and I looked dazed. Finally we relized nothing made
her scream she was just trying to scare us. After making it clear that she did
she had a very pleased look on her face. After about five minutes of laughing
about the whole thing we pulled into the cemetery. We all got out at the same
time and walked to the back of the car to see how much dirt was on the car.
Then we saw a clear dirty handprint. We all looked at it amazed. We measured to
see if the print was any of ours, it clearly wasn't it was way to small. Before
all this week Alex kept saying she felt a presence. We didn't stay at the
cemetery long after about five minutes we were really freaked out we left and
went home. The handprint can not be explained, well not by us at least. The
handprint remains there to this day...</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Hello again, my name is Gena, and I have written some of my
experiences here.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well, here is the
latest in that long line.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I am now a live in caregiver, and one night as I was taking
the person's dog out to "go", there was an inhuman scream from the
yard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The dog was so scared by it, that
she hid behind me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Well, I grabbed a flashlight, and went searching for the
origin of the sound because as a caregiver, part of my job is to protect my
charges.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I found nothing in the yard
(and it's a big one) that it would or could have come from.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">And then, about a month later, there it was again, only I
was inside at the time and had to go outside to hunt it down, and again found
nothing.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I called a friend, and he came out and said that it was most
likely the animal that was burried on the property, a family pet of the people
that owned the house before my charge bought it.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">But just last week, the person's daughter said that her pet
bunny was burried in the yard.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Now I have heard a rabbit scream before, and no bunnies
vocal chords could have made that sound.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I am not sure if it is as my friend says, or if it is something
else.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was just way wierd.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Corpse Eyes</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: ghoster113@yahoo.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>I've had several
encounters with things I can't explain, but the one that still gives me chills
happened several years ago in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region>.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>It happened one night
after I had met some friends at a bar for a few drinks and conversation. I left
before anyone else in the group (I've never been much of a drinker) and although
my house was only a few blocks from the bar, I decided to take a walk along a
part of the base that was bordered by <st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Tokyo</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType>Bay</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> before going home.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>I was walking along a
sidewalk that was seperated from the water by a low concrete wall and looking
out over the bay when I heard someone cough in front of me. I looked up and saw
a woman, who was dressed in a white blouse and grey skirt, walking toward me
from the other direction. She was about twenty feet away and walking straight
toward me at a unsteady pace and I was surprised that she had got that close to
me without my noticing her sooner. She had her head down and she was coughing
like she was trying to get something out of her lungs, but couldn't get enough
air into her lungs to cough strong enough to clear them.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>She kept walking
right at me, I actually had to step aside to keep her from running into me, and
when she was about to pass by me I asked her if she was ok because the way she
was coughing was really worrying me. She raised her head and turned to look at
me and what saw when her face turned toward me froze me in my tracks.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Let me say I've been
afraid before, I've faced off with Soviet ships at three to one odds in their
favor during the cold war, been shot at by Iraqis during desert storm, and
weathered a volcanic eruption in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
but I have never seen anything as frightening as that woman's eyes.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>There's only one way
I can explain what they looked like, one summer while I was a military
policeman we had several accidental deaths and I was dispatched to many of the
accident scenes. The bodies of the victims all had one thing in common, their
eyes, they looked flat and empty with no light of life in them. I remember
thinking they seemed to be staring at something and found myself wondering what
they saw. Morbid, I know, but dealing with dead bodies isn't easy, it tends to
hold your mortality up and shake it at you so to speak. Anyway, back to where
this is going, this woman's eyes were the eyes of a corpse.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>My first impulse was
to run, to get as far away from this woman as I could, but I couldn't get my
legs to work, all I could do was stand there as the woman continued past me and
out of my field of vision. A few seconds later the coughing stopped and I
risked turning my head and looking in the direction the woman had gone.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The sidewalk was empty.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>I did find out a bit
of history about that particular area, it's pretty interesting. It seems that
many years ago a man was having an affair with a woman he worked with. He asked
his wife for a divorce, but the wife refused to grant him one, either hoping to
win him back or out of spite, I don't know which. One night the man and his
girlfriend confronted the wife in their apartment and, when the arguement
became physical, the wife was stabbed several times. In a panic, the man and
his girlfriend carried the wife's body from the aprtment and threw it into <st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Tokyo</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType>Bay</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> right in the area where I saw
this woman with the corpse eyes. About a week later a fisherman caught the
woman's body in his nets and, as a result of the investigation, the man was
convicted of murder, but the girlfriend went free.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>After the encounter I
talked to other people who have heard similar stories and one person who had a
similar encounter in that area. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>A few years later
that part of the bay was filled in and several years after that a ballfield was
built on the land fill. for awhile I wonderd if that would stop the encounters,
until I talked to one man who claims that while he was parked near the land
fill one night he saw a woman in a skirt walking near the waters edge on the
land fill. He said he turned to talk to his wife, who was in the car with him,
and when he turned back the woman was gone.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>What do the staring
eyes of the corpse see? They see nothing....nothing and beyond.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">a local legend in big rapids...off in the woods on a small
dirt road a man lost his life in a car acccident, and now haunts that old road.
going north out of big rapids, turn right on meceola road, follow that a few
miles and take a left on a dirt road (i cant remember the name, when ivisit
there again ill make sure to email it to you) and follow that all the way to
the intersection in the middle of the woods.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>if you turn around and double back until you reach the second to last
hill, you park your car on the side of the road, and wait.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">the single lane dirt road is nearly engulfed by the
surrounding thick forest, creating a canopy of sorts, which blocks out most of
the moonlight.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">if you go there at night and sit in your car with everything
completely shut off, strange things happen.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>at first, you have an overwhelming feeling of foreboding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>after several minutes, faint yellow lights
can be seen just off to the right side of the road ahead, almost like lightning
bugs, whci come closerand closer to your car, until about 10 feet ahdead, they
will disappear, then the old man appears.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>i have done this multiple times, along with many area youth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>most of the stories share the lightning bug
phenomena, accompanied by the old man.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>i
have gone probably 6-8 times and have seen this 3 times.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the first time, the man was off down the
road, on the left, walking with his hands in his pockets or at his sides, not
looking up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>as soon as we saw that, we
split.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">the second time, we followed the same procedure as before,
turning everything off and waiting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>sure
enough, the yellow lights came after about</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">15 minutes, but there was no apparition ahead of us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>we waited for it to appear down the road, but
saw nothing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>all of a sudden across the
road perpendicular to the driver there he was walking away from the car, in a
very slow, fluid walk, looking down like he was sad. as soon as we turned the
car on he vanished.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">the third time there were no lightning bug affects, but after
20 minutes or so the old man appeared 50-75 feet down the road, this time
walking in haste across the road from right to left.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">i can assure you that this is no lie.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">My name is Freddy and I remember when I was a child, we
lived in a very old house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We had those
old light switches that would make a very loud click when you turned the light
on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My parents and I were very light
sleepers but sometimes I would be the first person to wake up on Saturday
morning to watch cartoons, the lights and t.v. would already be on and the t.v.
would be turned to a non-working channel.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Sometimes we would wake up in the middle of the night because the
thermostat would be set on 45 degrees F.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I remember one time i fell asleep on the couch and woke up the next
morning under my bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I remember I would
hear whispering sometimes in the middle of the night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sometimes i would get enough courage to say,
"Who is that?" but no one would answer me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I don't know if you would consider this a
haunting, but that's what happened.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I was researching hauntings in Colonial Williamsburg, and I
came across your site by chance......or was it?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Anyways, reading a story of a person who had a ghostly experience in the
Wythe House, I felt compelled to share my own experience at the Wythe House:</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">A friend and I spent last Christmas together in Colonial
Williamsburg.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One night we went on a
walking tour that took us around the town, ending in front of the Wythe
House.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While we were standing outside
the house in the bitting cold, my friend kept looking over to the right side of
the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">When I asked her what she was looking at, she told me that
there was a young lady dressed in black period clothing, with a shawl wrapped
around her shoulders, standing in the shadows by the Wythe House.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At first I thought she had gone mad with the
cold, but I looked over, and with God as my witness, there was indeed a young
lady standing in the shadows.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">What was interesting about the lady was that she was in
shadow, yet I could see her in some detail, except for the facial features and
hair color, which were indistinguishable.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As previously mentioned, she was wearing a long black dress, a white
shawl, and a white cap.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I could also see
that there was some very intricate embriodery work on the bodice of the gown.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Naturally, my friend and I assumed that she was just a part
of the tour, but when we asked the tour guide who she was, he told us that
there had been no lady in black standing beside the Wythe House.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This, of course, sent chills up our
spines.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, it also interested us
greatly, due to the fact that both my friend and I are very interested in
hauntings, especially ghosts fromt the colonial era.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The next day we began to ask around about the lady, but what
we found out only confirmed that we had indeed seen a spirit from the past.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">To this day we do not know who she was, or where whe was
from.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, until recently, I had not
remembered one important fact that should have told me she was a ghost from the
begining:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>as I said, she had been
wearing a white shawl.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It had been
rather windy that night, but I do not recall seeing her shall blowing in the
breeze.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">It's me again...</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I live in <st1:place><st1:City>Albany</st1:City>, <st1:State>OR</st1:State></st1:place>,
and about 11 years ago a friend of mine and I were at the cemetary on Knox
Butte to see the "glowing headstone" under the full moon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We couldn't find it, but we did find
something else...</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Since we couldn't find the headstone, we were just wandering
around the cemetary talking, when there was a rustling in the bushes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither of us thought much about it at first,
because there is a road and some houses behind the cemetary, but when neither
of us could see either a human or animal figure making the bushes move, we
decided to leave.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Now I am a Witch, and can sense entities of the rotten
nature, and this I could tell was not after me, but my friend who was very
suceptable to the spirits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I told her to
run for the car at the bottom of the hill, but she would not leave me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mind you, as we walked down the hill, the
rustling followed us. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I told her that we would both run on the count of 3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I counted and she took off, and I turned to
see whatever it may be, still hoping it was a dog.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But there was absolutely no corporial being,
and so I hightailed it, and when I got to the bottom I said a spell with her
screaming at me to get into the car, and trapped it in the cemetary.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">That night I found out why some cemetaries have fences.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It's to keep the nasties inside.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Well, we went to a well lit restaurant to have coffee and
calm down, she needed more calming than I did, as I have faced off with nasties
before.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I have told my friends about this (and thank heaven they
believe me) and they said that the next time I want to see a glowing headstone,
to take an army with me.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">My mom is a nurse and she has been working in nursing homes
for 29 years, and she has been around a lot of death so you can sure say she's
seen a lot. This story occurred in <st1:place><st1:City>Jonesboro</st1:City>,<st1:State>TN</st1:State></st1:place>,
which is the most haunted town in TN, so a lot of hauntings occur there. My mom
was working at Jonesboro Nursing Home, and she saw a lot of stuff, but this is
one of the many stories. It was winter, and my Mom and one person were working.
It had snowed a big storm and nobody had been in or out of the nursing home. My
Mom went to unlock the door for the kitchen people so they could come in to
make breakfast for the patients, and remember NOBODY had been in or out all
night, and in the snow there were little tiny footprints. They went out to the
road and came back to the door. My Mom called the person who was there with her
over to look at the footprints, and they went to check everybody's socks to see
if they were wet, but the socks were all dry... Then, they both said Tilly.
"Tilly" or Matilda Rupe was a patient who had died 2 months earlier.
She used to walk from the door to the road and back, and she had apparently decided
to pay my Mom a visit.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Fordham University Keating Hall third floor <st1:place>Bronx</st1:place>
<st1:State><st1:place>New York-</st1:place></st1:State></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My experience there must have been either during my
sophomore or junior year which was a little over a decade ago. I was delivering
a letter from Dealy to one of the offices on Keating third, after I delivered
the letter I walked to the other end of the hall when I felt someone touch my
shoulder I looked over my shoulder to see who it was but there was no one there
however at that moment I was passing a room that had blue walls it was there
that I noticed the figure of a person forming in the dust particles that was
shining through the adjacent window in the sunlight it must have been around
2.30 or 3.00 in the afternoon and sunny however it was still creepy and as soon
as I saw this I ran down the stairs and out of the building so fast that I must
of looked like a bunch of dust particles. The next day I returned with my then
best friend because I was definitely not going by myself and we investigated
the "blue Room" it turned out to be a<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>chapel and there was a plague on the wall dedicating the chapel to
someone who had passed away,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>could it
have been that person that decided to say hello to me the day before or was it
something else? </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I am a strong Bible believing Christian with a few different
takes on what these phenomenon could be and I have other experiences to tell
about some my own, some from others however not all necessarily related to
Fordham but that is a discussion for another time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">My mother is very reluctant to talk about this but...About 2
years ago, she mother moved into an older house very close to downtown <st1:place><st1:City>Lake
  Geneva</st1:City>, <st1:State>WI</st1:State></st1:place>. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">The extremely nice landlord lives downstairs and she lives
upstairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Two days after they moved in
my 18 year old sister, who is a very sound sleeper, woke suddenly to see a man
with dark hair wearing a baseball cap standing in her room near her doorway. </p>




<p class="MsoNormal">He was using one finger to beckon her to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Scared, she hid under her blanket for a few
seconds and when she looked again he was still there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He disappeared the third time she
looked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After that incident my sister
kept feeling and seeing things and she desperately tried to convince my mother
that something was terribly wrong.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">A few weeks later, myself, my husband, our 3 month old
daughter, my mother, my sister and my mother's boyfriend were in the living
room that has a partial view of the dining room and kitchen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My mom had made chili that evening but had
put too many jalapenos in it and it was too hot for my sister and I to
eat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My sister was heating leftovers in
the microwave, my husband and my mother's boyfriend were sitting on the couch,
and my mom and I were playing with my daughter on the floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When my mom commented that the cat was acting
strange, we all chuckled because it appeared that the cat was doing a sideways
grapevine motion. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Then a fork flew off the microwave in an arc and landed with
a thud in the middle of the floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
was not a natural motion and no one had touched it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">A few weeks later, my husband was with our daughter alone in
the living room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My mother and I went to
the store.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He kept hearing footsteps and
was trying to understand why it was taking us so long to get up the stairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He suddenly realized it was coming from the
kitchen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He turned and saw a tall,
dark-haired man walk across the room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
was not a believer in the paranormal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Honestly, he was barely a believer in life after death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is now.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Things kept happening and my mom confronted the landlord and
she said that it wasn't haunted and no other residents, including her own son,
had ever commented on anything strange.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My sister got a ride home from school from a friend one day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the friend pulled up to the house, her
eyes welled up with tears and she told my sister she had lived there for 7</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">years and asked if she knew that it was haunted.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My mom went to the landlord again and she finally admitted
that the previous owner's son had killed himself a few years after the family
moved from the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She gave us his
name and physical description.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">She knew it was him out of all the people who had ever lived
in the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My husband and I went to
the library and found a class portrait containing the "ghost's" photo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We showed it to my sister and she picked out
two people, one was the ghost.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This all
happened within the first month. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">We also found out that the apartment used to be two separate
apartments which may explain why he never haunts my mom's room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It's the only place a presence isn't
felt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also, the house used to be
connected to the house next door and was a boarding house. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I know this is long, so...I'll just highlight a few other
incidents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My brother's friend went to the bathroom late one night,
came out and found a kitchen cabinet, the drawer below it and the cabinet below
that, all aligned in a row and open.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
salt shaker from the dining room was in the middle of the floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My mom's friend won't come in the living
room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One day she asked my mom if she
knew that she had two ghosts that haunt her living room and that one is
benevolent, one is not.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The cat acts
very strangely.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Footsteps are heard
often.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lights turn on and off by
themselves.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Pots of food are found on the floor without anything being
spilled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I spent the night once and
someone moved my hair away from my face.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My brother was locked inside his room from the outside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My sister's drapes are always open in the
morning even if they are closed the night before.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She once tried to pin them closed and the
entire curtain rod was on the floor the next morning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Doors open and close, footsteps are heard and
no one is there.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">She almost called in a paranormal investigator but she's
scared the mean ghost will become more active. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">So far, so good...</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Ghost of Little Boy?</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: kentrax@yahoo.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>To begin with, I've
always been a believer in the un-seen world. Being raised in church all my life
I have heard (and experienced) stories of demons and the like. If you believe
in God, you must also believe in evil powers, since there is a constant,
on-going battle for the soul of man since the dawn of time as we know it.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>This little story is,
I suppose, more of a "ghost"</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">story than of evil spirits, although I could share a few.
Over 20 years ago, me, my now ex-wife, and our two boys lived in a quiet
neighborhood in Ft Worth, <st1:State><st1:place>Texas</st1:place></st1:State>.
This was a house we were renting, which was several years old.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Ever since we moved
in, I had had an eerie feeling about the place, just un-easy. I remember one
rainy night, my oldest son, who at the time was about 5, came in our room in
the middle of the night frightened. When we asked what was wrong, he told us of
seeing the face of a liitle boy looking in at him through his window. We told
him it had to be his imagination, after all, what would a little boy be doing
late at night, in the rain, looking in someone's window...right? </p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>I remember sometime
later, I was lying awake late at night while my wife slept. Suddenly, I
remember, ever so faintly, hearing a child crying somewhere nearby.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Again, I just blew it off. Until one certain morning..</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>On this particular
morning, my oldest son was'nt feeling well, so I told my wife I would take the
day off from work and stay with him. After she and our other son left, about half
an hour later I sat down in the living room to read the paper. Suddenly, my son
stepped in the room for a few seconds, and then stepped out. At least I assumed
it was my son, as I never looked up from the paper. No more than just a few
seconds later, I called his name.. no answer. I then got up and then went to
his bedroom.. only to find him sound asleep, under the covers. Now, that kinda
freaked me out. I knew, somehow, that was'nt my son who stepped in the room
that morning. Could it have been the long lost ghost of a little boy? After
tying all the other experiences together, it gave me chills.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Through the years
I've thought alot about that house, and that one<span style="">&nbsp; </span>morning, with the events I could'nt explain.
By the way, I asked my son later that morning if had gotten up, you guessed
it.. no.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">It was Sept. 1976 I was a new mother of 16 and my 2 week old
son was in his crib at the foot of my bed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I was sound asleep and woke up to a sound of my son gasping.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I jumped up and moved my way towards his
crib, that's when I saw it, this big dark shadow leaning over his crib.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I could see the figure of a man, a perfect outline, head,
shoulders, a sort of face or features any way, arms and a chest, it looked
thick and see through but dark just a gray/black dark, and as I moved around it
and went to pick up my son I was startled to see the babies eyes wide open
staring right at this thing and gasping for air,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>this dark shadows head looked right up at me
as I went to grab the baby,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>its face
stared at me and I at it as I picked up my little boy, and as I did I had to
reach almost under where its chest should have been to pick him up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was terrified and I didn't want to move but
my son was my whole world and I reached in and pulled him to my chest.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">As I grabbed my son<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>this thing straightened up and faced me, it was only about 1 foot away
from me and I knew its eyes were on me I could almost feel them going right
through us both, its head turned a little each way as if to look around the
room and<span style="">&nbsp; </span>it seemed to be so big and
tall,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I felt that this thing was evil, I
knew It was EVIL!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As I stood there with
my son, terrified<span style="">&nbsp; </span>my body shaking
uncontrollably and alone with my baby, this thing floated up a little and went
right through my son's and my body I actually felt it literally go through me,
as it did I turned to look behind me and watched it go right into the wall behind
us.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">At this point my son took a deep breath and began the worst
crying I had ever heard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I sat up all
night trying to make sense of what had happened. Needless to say, I had my son
sleep with me for the next 4 yrs.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">To this day I remember and wonder what the hell was that
thing, and what did it want with my son ?</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">While I was living in <st1:place><st1:City>Bellingham</st1:City>,
 <st1:State>WA</st1:State></st1:place> I went to the Bayview Cemetary with a
friend I had talked into going with me.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He was just as curious to see "Angel Eyes" as I was.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well, we never did see the angel, but we did
have a nasty follow us partway out of the cemetary, until I cast a spell that
knocked it for a loop, and when I did that, I got the distinct feeling that the
other inhabitants of the cemetary were very happy and it was party time.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">As we had gone there after dark, and closing time, we were
waiting for an opportunity to walk out onto the sidewalk without anyone seeing
us, when I was slightly shoved.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My friend was tying his shoe by a tree that was 6' away from
me and couldn't posibly have done it and gotten back to where he was before I
would have caught him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And I got the
distinct feeling that it was a child wanting to play, but I had to tell it that
I couldn't play now, that I had to go before I got caught.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I think it understood, because it felt like
it was waving "bye" to me.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">But that nasty was something else, and would have gotten
just about anyone else that wasn't able to give it a so-to-speak "black
eye".</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">My sister and her family lived in the stone house in
Nickersonvalley. Their daughter 9 years old at the time, said she couldn't
sleep because those little girls keep playing all night. They didn't know when
they bought the house that it had the history of the little girls dying in the
upstairs. They actually saw them sitting on the stairs one afternoon. They sold
the house shortly after that, and built a brand new house next door</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My family and I lived in a house that was owned by the
government, very old by Australian standards. It was just before I began my
schooling, and our next door neighbour was a lovely old Italian lady. Her
husband was not quite right mentally and would always be outside giving us kids
coins and saying -'Oh Dear, Oh Dear'. I think that's all he could say in
english. Apparently he used to beat her, but I was just a kid, so I didn't see
any of that. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">When he passed on, she was afraid to sleep in her house
alone, so my brother and a neighbourhood friend would stay sometimes. But they
didn't like it. They would come home very early the next morning pale-faced,
telling us tales of seeing Mr DeLouis in the room, or hearing his footsteps
down the corridor. We laughed and thought they were just being hilarious. Ha!
we were wrong.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Our family was very fond of Mrs DeLouis, and she was like
one of us, so it was quite natural for my newly married sister and her husband
to move in with her until they found their own place. I have three sisters and
one of them is married to a sceptic, when it comes to ghosts. They were in Mrs
DeLouis's kitchen, late one night, just talking, when all of a sudden they
heard a huge smashing of glass on the floor. They ran into where the sound was
coming from and the floor was covered with like windscreen glass. No window was
opened or broken. Not a dish was smashed, no cups, wine glasses, all the doors
were locked, light fixtures all intact -<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>nothing was out of order. Just this glass all over the floor. The sceptic
was suddenly a believer! </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Our house was very haunted too. I would hear knocking on the
walls all the time, 14 foot walls and no one was knocking that I could see. A
mirror that was fixed into the wall over one of the fireplaces suddenly smashed
one night,(a stormy one, typical huh) and scared the heck out of my sister. She
says she saw a man with a tall hat leaning on the mantlepiece looking at her.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">It was an old house, probably turn of the century. When we
first saw it, it still had old paintings and some old furnishings in it. The
huge backyard had little pathways that led to original stables with all sorts
of treasures in it. The good old Aussie dunnie was way down the backyard, and
I'm pleased to say, it was not working! The toilet we had to use was still
outside, but just on the back verandah. Not nice when you're a little kid who
has to go in the middle of the night. We would hear the front door being opened
with a key, solid footsteps walking down the long corridor, walking through
rooms until it would stop dead before we saw who it was. There was a certain
doorway that always had something go through it when you weren't looking, but
you saw it from the corner of your eye. My brother saw an Aboriginal lady
standing in our parents room late at night(we used to sleep with mum and dad
sometimes when we were little). My dad was a sceptic too, but sadly, mum and
dad split up, and he was left alone in that house for many years after. He saw
an Aboriginal mans face in the tv, but it wasn't even on. Dad loved those front
porch swings and he finally bought one. One night, he went to sleep and was
woken up by the dust-buster (portable vacuum cleaner) on the wall suddenly
flying off and crashing on the floor. The next day, the front porch swing was
gone, stolen. The spirit in the house was trying to wake him up! He always
heard the footsteps coming down the corridor and walking right up to the
kitchen in the back of the house where he was. He would turn expectantly
waiting for my sister, and no-one was there. While my mum was living there, she
was going through a really bad time with dad, and at night she would sometimes
feel a tender stroking down her arm, like it was trying to comfort her (it
wasn't dad!)</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Years later, the house was demolished to allow a bypass on
the freeway and the demolision team unearthed an Aboriginal burial site. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I still have vivid dreams of that house and my father living
there. He passed on in '88, but in my dreams I'm there and I see my dad in his
room, everything in it's place, I can still smell the same dad smell, the same
house smell and I feel like I never left.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">A Hospital Haunting In Philly</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">This is a true story, It happened in the city of <st1:City><st1:place>Philadelphia</st1:place></st1:City>
where I've lived all my life.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My youngest son at the time was 6years old, he was admitted
to a well known childrens hospital </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">located here<span style="">&nbsp; </span>for open
heart surgery..parents are allowed to stay overnight with child.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">our first night there my now ex husband and I was offerd a
private room for the first night .</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">this room is located on the surgery floor. when you first
enter there is a lounge with a TV and some lounge chairs for sleepng, which my
husabd found to be quite comfordable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>on
one wall there is 2 doors , these are the parents rooms. My husband<span style="">&nbsp; </span>was laying back<span style="">&nbsp; </span>reading. I went in to lie down,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>although I was not sleepy<span style="">&nbsp; </span>. after entering the room I looked around .</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">it was a small room with a double bed, 2 night tables with a
lamp and a telephone.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I was laying on the bed about 5minutes relaxing my self I
was not sleepy yet so I was just laying there listening to the TV that was
located right outside the bedroom door in the lounge.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">( I was not sleep) All of a sudden, I hear this little girl
say<span style="">&nbsp; </span>" do you wanted to
play"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>at first I thought I was
hearing things or was hearing the TV but then I heard it again . and sounded
like she was talking under water. the hairs stood up all over my whole body. I
sat up on the side of the bed. now frightened<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>and unsure of what I was hearing looking around the room trying to locate
the child ,</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">knowing all the time no one is in there but me . in the
outer<span style="">&nbsp; </span>room I can hear the television
playing a kiddy program and I'm wondering what childs program is on so late and
what parent would be watching it .</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">as I stood up I heard<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>it a 3rd time "do you want to play". I did't waste any time
getting out of that room. as soon as you open the bedroom door you are in the
lounge area . the Television was off and the lounge was empty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At that point my husband walked in I told him
what happend and he said he never turned the television on and that no one else
came in . it was <st1:time minute="30" hour="23">11:30pm</st1:time><span style="">&nbsp; </span>so no children was in the area at that time
or he would have seen them<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and so would
I.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I can still hear her as if it was yesterday, I will never
forget the sound of her voice light and bubbly</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">sounding like if you tried to talk under water,<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>" do you want to play.? "</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I've been a "sensitive" my entire life, feeling,
seeing and hearing ghosts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When my
middle daughter, her partner and their baby girl moved into a house here in <st1:City><st1:place>Youngstown</st1:place></st1:City>,
my first visit to their home was completely unnerving.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At first, I ignored my feelings, putting it
down to the fact the house wasn't in a good area and needed a lot of work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As my daughter was showing me the house, the
presences there definitely made themselves known to me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first floor was fine, but as we
progressed up the stairs, that old familiar feeling of ghosts was
overwhelming.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The attic and basement were
true "hot spots."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As we walked
up the stairs to the attic, I could feel an almost eerie sadness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is one large room, with 2 smaller rooms
at front &amp; back of the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
front room a little girl told me her name was Lucy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I could "see" where her bed was
along one wall, pink blanket &amp; all.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She was very unhappy, and I got the impression that she spent a lot of
time in that room being punished.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her
sadness and despair literally brought me to tears.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the back bedroom was an old metal bed frame.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When I touched it, nausea and revulsion
filled me and I had to snatch my hand away.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Something BAD happened in that bed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When we toured the basement, there was a fruit cellar with a lock on the
OUTSIDE of the door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I felt that a
little boy had been locked in there as punishment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I couldn't read him enough to get his name,
only that he had been confined there.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Whoever the parents of these children were, they certainly were very
harsh on their kids!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I've had many
experiences of this type, but this one hit home because my daughter and
granddaughter were living there.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Fortunately my daughter didn't stay there long; the negativity in that
house pretty much drove them out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even
now if I drive past the house, I can feel Lucy at the window, and her presence
is as strong as ever.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">My name is Jessica and I am sixteen years old.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have been living in my home in <st1:place><st1:City>Littleton</st1:City>
 <st1:State>Colorado</st1:State></st1:place> for around seven months.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was right after I had moved back in with
my mother.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The house is a one story with
a basement where my bedroom is located.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My mother's bedroom is located upstairs at the end of the hallway.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her and I have both experienced
several...apparitions and bumps in the night.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The first in this house started in our first month.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was asleep in my room until around <st1:time minute="0" hour="2">2 am</st1:time>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
woke up because I heard a man upstairs muttering something, he continued to
speak for several minutes until finally the chatter stopped.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I tried to ignore it because I have had many
experiences before and this one seemed no different.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The most often occurence is that of a hooded
figure shrouded in all black standing in the corner of my room, just standing
there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Another less often one is that of
a girl with black hair and torn clothing crawling on my floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At one point, my mother woke up in the middle
of the night when her bedroom door was opened and the sallow face of a man
stared at her from the opening.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
remained there for around twenty minutes until she finally worked up the
courage to see what was really going on, but when she got out of bed, the man
disappeared.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The next happening occurred
around <st1:time minute="0" hour="0">midnight</st1:time> when I was suddenly
woken up by my shaking closet door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both
the door and handle were shaking violently.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It lasted for two minutes and then stopped, I was frightened and had
hidden my head under the covers of my bed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I did not fall back asleep.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
most recent experience happened to my mother.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Two nights ago as she layed in d, she could not sleep because a sudden
feeling of fear came over her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She told
me the next day that she for the first time felt like she was going to
die.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our cat had also been running
around the house crying out and poofing his tail out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He would go no where near my mother.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The women in my family have had a strange
trait of dealing with paranormal occurences.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My aunt Cathy recently divulged her most terrifying experience to my
mother.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In her home in <st1:place><st1:City>Phoenix</st1:City>
 <st1:State>Arizona</st1:State></st1:place>, my Aunt had gotten up in the
middle of the night because her new born son had begun to cry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She walked into the kitchen to heat up some
milk when the sound of fingernails scraping a chalkboard was heard going around
the walls of her kitchen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She began to
shout, "I plead the blood of Jesus Christ over this house and all those in
it and I rebuke you in the name of the Lord."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and it stopped.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My father, having never dealt with such
encounters, forced me to see a Psychiatrist and the doctor prescribed me an
anti-psychotic to prevent my "visions" or schtzophrenic episodes as
he called it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But no medicine helped and
I continue to this day to see figures in the corners of my bed room and hear
the noises and voices from the upstairs.<span style="">&nbsp;

<p class="MsoNormal">My experience was back when I was 9 years old. We lived in a
very large 13 room house in Reading <st1:State><st1:place>Mass.</st1:place></st1:State>
Jean <st1:City><st1:place>Dixon</st1:place></st1:City> came to our house the
day we where moving and confirmed this haunting. I can remember how chaotic
everything was that day and how so many times before Henry (Ghost) made our
lives change from non believers to believers. It all started the day my father
had his heart attack. A knock on the front door at <st1:time minute="0" hour="0">midnight</st1:time>
which continued every night there after. One morning sitting down at the table
eating breakfast my Mother called my brother down stairs and asked him who he
was talking to last night. Leslie who at the time was 8 years old told her he
is talking to Henry. My Mom gave him a piece of paper and pencil and asked him
to draw a picture of Henry and he drew a picture of a man with a dark cape on.
Leslie also started speaking in Latin. One time while going to into his room I
came upon pictures Leslie had kept under his bed and found needles stuck in the
pictures. When Leslie was confronted by my Mother about these pictures he
stated that Henry did not like this person and asked him to put the needles in
the pictures.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Being so young at the time
myself I was frightened but at the same time I did not fully understand what
was happening. One day while walking into my parents room My mother and oldest
brother where holding Leslie down with a crucifix on his head and Leslie
screaming out it burns it burns......It took a year to sell this house and that
was one year seeing doors close on their own to objects flying across the
rooms. Seeing my sister screaming after clawing at something in the night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I never saw Henry in his cape as a child. I
do however remember the specks of light that would cross my path and praying it
would go away. And the nightmares I had for years after moving out of this house.

<p class="MsoNormal">I sent in another ghost story of mine the other day, and
thought you might like this one as well:</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">About five years ago, when I was twelve, my family and I
spent Halloween in Colonial Williamsburg, Va. (if you haven't gone, I would
suggest, most strongly, that you do).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My
father, older brother, and myself, had just gone to a legends 'concert' at the
courthouse, and were walking down the street to meet up with my mother and
younger brother, who had been trick'or'treating in the historic area.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We were to meet up with them outside the <st1:place><st1:PlaceName>Bruton</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceName>Parish</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType>Church</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My mother and younger brother were late, as they usually
are, so we were given the opportunity to sit down and enjoy the cool of the
night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After about five minutes I could
distinctly hear organ music coming from the church, it sounded oddly like
Handel's Massiah.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I told my father about
the music, and he listened for it, but said he could not hear anything, which I
thought was very odd as I was not given to delusions or anything of the
sort.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, nonetheless, I continued to
hear the organ music playing; of course, when you are twelve you don't exactly
pay attention to details, but there were no lights on in the church, a fact
which I paid no heed to at the time.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Later that evening I asked a bus driver if there was some
sort of concert going on in the church, but, to my great shock, she said that
no, there was nothing going on at the church that evening, and when I said that
I had hear organ music playing in the church she gave me a rather odd look and
said that there could not have been anyone in the church, as it was closed for
the day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Naturally I didn't think much
about it at the time, but, we are going back for Halloween this year; and,
perhaps the phantom organist will be putting on another show.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Last Night I was talking to my friend about ShadowLands and
how she should put her exsperience on. She started telling me them and the one
we shared. I had forgotten for so long, because I didn't want to remember, but
its back and I have to tell.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">It was three years ago, in 6th grade. Me and the rest of the
girls where getting ready for gym. My friend Sre started telling us about a
legand a our school. We where laughing about the haunting and goofing around.
When we heard foot steps above us. Our school has an attic, but it doesn't
exstend that far, so they couldn't have walked over us. We quickly left the
room as we heard a locker slam on the other side of the room, and their was no
one there.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">After Gym we all had to stay in the locker room for fifteen
minutes. We all sat on the bench and me and two of my other friends went on the
other side of the room to go see the locker that slammed earlier. We where
about to touch it when the door leading to a small locked room, opened and
slammed. Grant it's nearly impossible to slam these doors or get to them from
the outside, because the room is tightly locked and can't be open. We did what
any sane person would do we paniced. We could hear the guys through the thick
wall. Telling us to calm down. They tried to comfort us through the walls, but
got in trouble for yelling so they could be heard. My other friend went to the
shower to get her towl. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">A few of us went too, and we saw a blood red hand print on
the wall, like it had been dragged. It hadn't been there before. We got our
teacher, but when she came in with all of us, it was gone. She said we where
imagining things and she left. A few minutes later, we heard a whisper, it
sounded like a girl, but it wasn't any of us.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Thigs like this kept happening and we kept running by our
gym teacher to tell her this. It all stopped after that day, but we never
looked at the locker room the same way again. Our teacher now bealives us, she
thought we where joking, but she too says that theres something wrong with the
locker room.</p>

that time I was going through a faze were I love grave jards, I have no idea

<p class="MsoNormal">One day my friend and I went down the road to the grave jard
to put some flowers on her sisters grave, when we were there we heared what
sounded like an old man talking to us from behind a tree they were saying go
away over and over again, I thought it was my brother and went around the tree
to hit him and there was no one there, my friend and I were kinda fright out so
we left, the next ti I went there I had a look under the tree again and I saw a
grave that I must have missed the last time we were there, It was the grave of
an old man who I think lived in my friends house years before, the story goes
he hated people coming to see him and after his wife died never saw any one
till he died, I put flowers on his grave told him I was sorry and lefted I
never heared him again.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I was home alone when I was 12, my mom was out with some
friends and my brother was just next door with my grandmother. I was watching
T. V when i heard a sound in the bathroom. I just thought is was the cat so I
didn't think much of it. So it was about time I'd go to sleep because i had
school the next day I was going to go to sleep in my room but since my mom was
still gone i decided to sleep on the couch so if she came back i could unlock
the door. All the lights were turned out and I was almost asleep when I heard
like footsteps in the bathroom so I looked up and i could see the nightlight
shine to the living room from the bathroom then I saw a figure of a man in a
hat that looked exactly like the man who used to live in the house before us.
The shadow got closer and closer to the wall the light and I looked back and
there was no one anywhere so i got scared and got up to go check it out when
the wooden toilet seat slammed down and shattered into pieces. A loud whistling
sound and it was gone. I never had an appearance again but it like he was
telling me that he had passed over and he was happy and ok were he was. We knew
the man so it wasn't like he was telling me that he didn't want us there but he
was a great friend to use but still it was freaky!<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">When my sister, now 31, was 4 she moved up into the attic,
the room i, now 14, am in. When i first moved up here, it was normal, then
stuff happeded, weird noises and movements in the dark. Then, i told my sis,
and she said "It's just George" she says that george was there when
she was a kid, and would do good stuff for her, like close doors and bring her
the rabbit she had in her room if she had a nightmare. I was always beliving in
ghost, but was slightly scheptical about this George guy, but i was open
minded. Then, after doors started closing for me, i would say 'Thanks
George" or something like that. Then, i saw him, he actually talks to me
now! i like him, and he can stay as long as he wants.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">28 NOV 04</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">about 7 or 8 years ago, when i was about 5 or 6 maybe, i was
outside one of my old houses riding my bike around our cul-de-sac. my mom was
sitting on the steps of our house probably reading a magazine or something. we
were the only people outside that afternoon. anyway, my bike was the kind
where, to use the brakes, you had to push the peddles backward. i wasn't very
good at using them but i usually peddled slow enough that if i wanted to stop,
all i had to do was let my feet down on the ground and let friction slow me
down. the cul-de-sac was sort of shaped like a "P". actually that?s
exactly how it was shaped. the long line at the left side of the "P"
was a steep hill. half of it was asphalt and then it cut of into an even
steeper grassy hill that led straight into a rocky ditch. ( i hope you get the
picture) my house and the hill are on completely opposite sides of each other.
anyway, i was flying down the hill and i missed the turn into the
"loop" of the "P". i panicked and forgot how to use the
brakes. i started screaming for my mom. she looked up and watched in horror as
i soared down the hill. she yelled for me to use the brakes and i yelled back
" I CAN?T! I CAN?T!? she started sprinting towards me, crying hyste cally.
she knew where i was headed and how bad i was going to get hurt on the rocks.
all at once, she was running, crying, and praying like crazy. she said she was
a few yards away when she saw me hit the grassy hill and then i stopped making
any sounds at all. she continued running at top speed and praying even faster.
when she reached the top of the grass, she saw my bike stop at the middle of
the hill. it just stopped dead in its tracks on a steep hill. she didn't give
it thought at all. she just ran to my halted bike and picked me up in her arms.
i wasn't screaming or crying. she said i was looking straight ahead and was
very stiff. i was literally paralyzed by fear. as soon as she had hold of me,
my bike took off again, flying as fast as it was, down the hill and crashed
into the rocky ditch. again, she gave it no thought. she was just happy she had
me and i was ok. she walked back up the hill with me in her arms. we sat down,
i in her lap, at the top. it was then that i woke out of my shock and we both
were crying. She notice that none of our neighbors had come out or anyone. We
were still the only people outside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>then
she started to realize what she had just witnessed my bike do and probably
started thanking God like crazy. she believes it was my guardian angel that
saved me that day.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">sorry but i didn't expect my story to be so long. i don't
really remember this happening but i can recall a little bit. my mom has had many
encounters with the paranormal throughout her life whether she will admit to
the supernatural being the cause or not. ive had many of my own experiences as
well but i never share them with anyone. this is the 1st time actually. i like
having my own secrets. but i really love this site so maybe ill share another
one in time. thanks<span style="">&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Haunted</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">By: shidariana@yahoo.com</p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I am 13 yrs. old. Throughout my life, I have had some very
creepy experiences.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When I was 4
yrs. old I had seen a ghost. After my parents split up me, my brother, and my
mom slept in the same room sharing the same bed. I would sleep in the middle
and my mom and brother would sleep on the sides. My mom always slept by the
glass sliding door and had a big knife in case something ever happened. Well,
one night I wanted to sleep by the glass sliding door. I couldn't sleep because
I always saw a man with red eyes staring at me. As I looked down on the floor
glancing at the knife, I saw a figure laying on the floor moving around in a
coat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I screamed and my brother hurried
up and ran for the light. When he turned on the light he saw nothing. I told
them what I saw and my mom began to check the room and the whole house but
there was no trace of anyone, not even the coat but a cheap fragrance of
cologne filled through the whole house. We then decided to moved out into an
apartment because the house was way too big and too many things happened.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I hated sleeping at night because as I looked in the
hallway, I would see things walk by. They never came into the room. For some
reason they'd stop there. Things would fall. I never liked turning towards the
window because I always saw someone with no eyes peering into the window. It
seemed like they would be screaming and hitting on the window at the same time.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Now that I'm 13 things have gotten a little more creepier. I
stay up late chatting online. Although I know of seeing things, I still stay up
late. The scariest part in the house is from the living room all the way to the
hallway and into my brothers room.</p>




<p class="MsoNormal">When I have the lights off in the living room and I'm
sitting on the couch, I look at the other couch and see a figure sitting there
with long black hair and a very pale face. Sometimes I see a very tall and
skinny figure standing at the edge of the couch.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My mom has curtains covering the hallway entrance. However I
don't like them closed. When I turn out the lights in the living room and I
turn the hallway light on I'll look in the gap of the curtains. Sometimes I see
hands coming through the curtain or an eye that's just looking at me. When I
turn off the lights off to go into the room, I feel like something is grabbing
at my back. It's like they're pulling at me and I walk really fast, but as I
enter my room I feel safe. I turn around and I see all this black figures just
looking at me. But sometimes walking in my room doesn't make me feel safe. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">One time I sent into the bathroom and no one was home. I had
closed the door and got in the shower. Well when I got out, something brushed
up against the door like a body. I was too afraid to open the door so I yelled
out, "Who is it." Of course there was no answer, when I opened the
door there was no one there, no one was in the house or anything. </p>


<p class="MsoNormal">There was an incident that occured when me and my mom was
home alonde. She had asked me to walk into the other room to see why the dogs
were barking. I go to walk down the hallway and my brothers door opens. (Mind
you this, the door was shut completely). I scream and run back into the room
where my mom was and we both looked in the hallway. We saew a white figure, the
shape of a little girl run quickly past the hallway and into the living room.
The dog opened the back sliding door and came in. He was growling. Of course we
didn't go in there. Instead my dad had came home just in the nick of time and
got the dog out. I never went to sleep that night and never turned off my
lights.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">There's a mirror in the hallway and when the curtains or
open you can see things walking by. One morning I woke up and the curtains were
closed. Everyone was asleep. I had asked my mom if she closed them and she said
no. Everyone that I asked in the house had the same reply.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I believe that the closet in my room is haunted. I have my
bed up against the closet entrance because the door was taken off. But when I
go to turn on the light a very cold hand will touch mine and I hate that
feeling because it sends jolts through my body.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">Sometimes I can hear footsteps stopping in front of my bed
or walking near the edge, that's why I don't sleep on the edge. Sometimes when
I take the covers off my face, I can feel something hovering about my head and
when I looked up there's a big black figure, it's like darker than the room
itself.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">A lot of creepy stuff happens. I do not look forward to
seeing any of them and I wished that someone else would be the victim other
than me. It has put great fear in me. I am afraid to even sleep alone or turn
off the lights.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>


<p class="MsoNormal">My name is Daniella, I'm 26 and I now live in <st1:place><st1:City>Durand</st1:City>,
 <st1:State>Wisconsin</st1:State></st1:place> since the "happenings"
occurred. I lived in <st1:place><st1:City>Alma</st1:City>, <st1:State>Wisconsin</st1:State></st1:place>
when it happened and I was alone when the "terror" moment occurred
(not the first incident in that building but the worst). I have not told many
people about this except those I trust because I refuse to be looked at as
crazy. I lived in an apartment my address was: <st1:address><st1:Street>114 S.
  Main St.</st1:Street> <st1:City>Alma</st1:City>, <st1:State>Wisconsin</st1:State>
 <st1:PostalCode>54610</st1:PostalCode></st1:address> the year of 2001 (just in
case you feel the need to check up on it). Anyway, like I said, I was alone
with my infant daughter and my dog. I was in my bedroom trying to get to sleep
with my daughter somewhere around <st1:time minute="0" hour="1">1am-2am</st1:time>
if I recall right. My dog was laying at the edge of my bed and being the guard
dog that she is, any noise makes her bark. Now, she wasn't barking but she was
doing a low growl type gurgle. Which to my knowledge, is something she only
does when someone comes near me physically. Knowing that we were alone, I
continued to lay in bed with the blanket covering most my face telling her to
shush for about 2 or so minutes on and off.</p>


<p class="MsoNormal">I did get alittle irritated with her going on and on that I
sat up to say to her "out", go lay in the living room something to
that effect when I seen what I thought was a man standing in the door way of my
bedroom door. Now, ha ha.....I know I am not crazy because I had my fish tank
light on in my living room directly straight from my bed in my room ( straight
across ya know from where my bed was from one room to the next is what I mean).
This figure showed light around him everywhere except where I saw black. I had
the worst emotions (if that is what I can call them) when I saw
"him". I am almost pos ive it was a man, tall, wide shoulders, and no
details to his cloths or face just a black shadowy type figure. Just the way "it"
stood also later made me think "it" was a man. There was no sound to
the black figure and it lasted quite some seconds before it was gone. Oh dear
god, I couldn't sleep for anything that night, let alone leave my room till
late that morning. I went about my morning business ya know showered, feed my
daughter and got dressed etc. yet, nothing else had happened and the feelings
of something evil never left my mind from hours before. I was going to get the
mail that morning with my daughter, which for me, the post office is across the
street so I was getting ready to lock my door when a man walked by my door,
(fumbling to lock the door), the man after taking I don't know how many steps
past my apartment stopped dead in his tracks turned to look at me and my god
the feelings that I had that night before came rushing back because he stood
there till I fumbled to get back in my apartment (needless to say, I never got
my mail). And even after I got in my door locked it and looked out the window
to see if he was still there he was, still looking back at my apartment right
at me in the window. He made no effort to say a word to me but the feelings I
felt from that felt like he knew who came to my room that early morning. I
didn't leave my apartment for about three days after that. For about a year
after the "happenings", I would get bad vibes here and there from
people who just would cross my path, like say at Wal-Mart a women or man could
just reach to grab a cart and the feelings from that night were back and sometimes
so overwhelming I would have to leave the store. Honest, that night I thought I
had the devil in my home I was so terrified by it and the man the next morning.
I mean I had friends telling me to bless the apartment and so on to rid the
"evil spirits". I'm not that religious to begin with, but I believe
there is more to what meets the everyday eye but wh that happened I felt man,
if a lack of sleep causes this then I better get some help rather than to try
and raise my daughter on my own. I really felt I was imagining this and is was
a direct result of being tired ( seeing as I was up all the time with my
daughter) till I saw something on the "TLC" channel about this just
tonight. My daughters father and I had also lived in one of the upstairs
apartments before we had lived in a lower one. We had also had happenings there
too, but not "evil", I guess I should say. Many times us or our
neighbors seen or heard a dog outside of our doors in the hallway a Springer
Spaniel with a clanking chain collar. One night, when my daughters father and I
were messing around on the living room floor when I saw a man for a split
second standing against the wall next to our bedroom leaning on the wall. I saw
him though, he had a handle bar type mustache and looked kinda he was dressed forties
era maybe thirties. We also would have knocks at our doors and heard a little
girl laughing, now I heard laughing a couple times but some of the others saw
her walking away from them (her back to their front). I couldn't say, I never
saw her but I was told about other things like that. We asked our landlord if
anyone else had ever said things to him other tenants who had lived there
before us, he laughed and said there was a book at the Alma Library for us to
rent on unusual and haunted places in Wisconsin, he assured us his building was
not one of the two in the book located in Alma. He did say the two apartments
on the top floor were once on home for a man who owned the building. He said
the downstairs was a cigar factory while he owned it but that's all I know. So
that is about it since I have not lived there I have not heard or seen
anything. Yet, I once in a while get the bad vibes from someone I may touch up
against or happen to notice. It's almost like they stick out and I wonder why I
have those feelings never did I have them bef e that night of the black figure
or after the happenings we had upstairs. You got me! I don't know what happened
that night but I sure wanted to tell my story to someone who may understand it.
If you got feedback for me let me know I would love to know why it happened not
that I expect you to know but maybe "in theory", what you think it
was and why, or what for. I was scared, I was really scared when it happened
and I was just in this place of outside myself kinda I was so confused, wow I
didn't know it would be hard to explain, hell, it creeps me out now telling
you, just typing it makes me wonder. It makes me re-think everything I thought
I knew you know what I mean, now that I know there's more out there who have experienced
this. So thanks for the website it helped alittle and just thanks for I guess
knowing this happens. Like I said you can always drop a line as to what you
think causes this to occur I would greatly appreciate it.</p>
