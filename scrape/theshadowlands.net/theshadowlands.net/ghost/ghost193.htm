<p><b>Changing Sounds in Oklahoma</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: jsevers_ok@yahoo.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>This event happened in the late summer of ’62 or ’63.</b>
<br><b>The evening was just like any other school night.&nbsp; My</b>
<br><b>brother and father were in the living room watching</b>
<br><b>television, my mom and sister were in mom’s bedroom</b>
<br><b>sewing or something.&nbsp; I had homework to do, so I was</b>
<br><b>sitting at the dinning room table.&nbsp; I recall that</b>
<br><b>evening clearly enough that I remember I was doing a</b>
<br><b>math assignment.&nbsp; My uncle was staying with us and had</b>
<br><b>been for a couple of months.&nbsp; My uncle always enjoyed</b>
<br><b>sitting on the front porch or out on the lawn away</b>
<br><b>from the house.&nbsp; The evening was already dark and with</b>
<br><b>summer still in the air, the front door and a few</b>
<br><b>windows were open.&nbsp; I wasn’t paying much attention to</b>
<br><b>anything except the math assignment.&nbsp; Perhaps my uncle</b>
<br><b>tried to get the attention of my dad or brother first</b>
<br><b>but for whatever reason he came to me and asked me to</b>
<br><b>come outside. Speaking in Creek, my uncle said he</b>
<br><b>wanted me to listen to something strange that was</b>
<br><b>happening. Everyone in my family spoke the Creek</b>
<br><b>(Muskogee) Indian language all the time when we were</b>
<br><b>home. I followed him out the front screen door, out to</b>
<br><b>the far front of the lawn.&nbsp; We lived in the country</b>
<br><b>and at the time we lived on an eighty-acre plot of</b>
<br><b>land.&nbsp; The end of our mowed lawn was a good fifty</b>
<br><b>yards from the front porch.&nbsp; I stood with my arms</b>
<br><b>folded and just as I was about to ask Uncle Joe what I</b>
<br><b>was listening for, he said, “Listen”.&nbsp; The front of</b>
<br><b>the house faces east so to the Northeast the sound</b>
<br><b>came of a tomcat meowing, as male cats do when going</b>
<br><b>off on a hunt.&nbsp; The meowing started a ways down the</b>
<br><b>oiled road that went out to the oil pumps on the North</b>
<br><b>side of our property.&nbsp; Nothing quite strange about</b>
<br><b>that for we had several cats living in or underneath</b>
<br><b>some utility buildings near the house.&nbsp; Oddly, the</b>
<br><b>meowing changed to the sound of a dog howling.&nbsp; The</b>
<br><b>howling was a strange sound.&nbsp; I have gone hunting with</b>
<br><b>my dogs many times in the woods behind our home but</b>
<br><b>the howling I listened to that night was truly</b>
<br><b>strange.&nbsp; The howling was coming closer to the front</b>
<br><b>yard.&nbsp; Just then, the howling changed to the sound of</b>
<br><b>a hooting owl.&nbsp; The hooting was coming closer to the</b>
<br><b>house.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the hooting changed to the tomcat and</b>
<br><b>then to the howling again.&nbsp; When all of sudden</b>
<br><b>everything was silent.&nbsp; Only the summer night insects</b>
<br><b>kept up their hissing.&nbsp; My uncle and I stood for a</b>
<br><b>while longer waiting for the sounds to start again but</b>
<br><b>they never did.</b><b></b>
<p><b>I told of what my uncle and I heard that night on</b>
<br><b>several occasions during the following years.&nbsp; No one</b>
<br><b>every said anything about having a similar experience,</b>
<br><b>not even any member of my family.&nbsp; That is until, one</b>
<br><b>day, six or seven years ago, my sister, brother and I</b>
<br><b>went to visit a very close friend of our father.</b>
<br><b>During the visit, Dave began talking about how he</b>
<br><b>missed our father.&nbsp; Our dad had died a couple years</b>
<br><b>before of a heart attack.&nbsp; He mentioned how generous</b>
<br><b>my grandpa and dad had been to him.&nbsp; Just North of our</b>
<br><b>home, up a wooded hill use to sit another house.&nbsp; The</b>
<br><b>house and land belonged to my grandfather who had</b>
<br><b>passed on years before I was born.&nbsp; My grandfather was</b>
<br><b>a pretty successful farmer and rancher.&nbsp; He was an</b>
<br><b>important enough figure in the neighborhood that the</b>
<br><b>county appointed him Deputy Sheriff of Okfuskee</b>
<br><b>County.&nbsp; Anyway, I never heard of the reason but the</b>
<br><b>house on the hill was given to Dave.&nbsp; Dave began</b>
<br><b>telling us about the adventures and mishaps he and dad</b>
<br><b>had shared growing up in rural Oklahoma.&nbsp; While Dave</b>
<br><b>was reminiscing he began to tell of something he heard</b>
<br><b>one night as he sat on his porch.&nbsp; He told of hearing</b>
<br><b>the very same thing my uncle and I heard years after.</b>
<br><b>I told Dave of what Uncle Joe and I had heard for the</b>
<br><b>first time that evening.&nbsp; Until then he too didn’t</b>
<br><b>know of anyone else hearing the same sounds.</b>
<br><b>I don’t know what we heard on the two separate</b>
<br><b>occasions in Oklahoma. However, I distinctly remember</b>
<br><b>what sounds my ears captured.&nbsp; I believe there are</b>
<br><b>spirits on this Earth and it is we lucky few who get a</b>
<br><b>chance to see or hear them.</b>
<br><b>Thanks for listening….</b>

<p><b>Call from The Dead</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: dohara@ciaccess.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I am 31 years old and have had quit a few paranormal experiences

<br><b>to think that it was all in my head and so did everyone else in
my</b>
<br><b>family.It started when I was about 10 . My mother's best friend
of 6</b>
<br><b>years passed away with liver diease. My mom and I went to see her
at the</b>
<br><b>hospital ,I could not go in she looked to bad to see my mom had
said ,</b>
<br><b>but I was curious and peeked through to take aa quick glance . She
was</b>
<br><b>not the same lady I knew 1 month ago . I felt awful that I could
not go</b>
<br><b>in to say hi but mom knew best . Two days went by and she passed
away</b>
<br><b>Mom told me and I felt so much pain that I could not tell her goodbye.</b>
<br><b>My mom was just as hurt she lost her best friend . We went on after
that</b>
<br><b>but I felt unsettled like there was something someone wanted to
tell me.</b>
<br><b>My mom didn't hide anything from me I kneew she was dying and why
and</b>
<br><b>how mom told me She wouldn't keep anything from me .Three weeks
lateer I</b>
<br><b>was watching T.V with my brother the phone rang I got up to answer
it .</b>
<br><b>There was no dial tone just crackling I heard a faint voice asking
for</b>
<br><b>my mother's&nbsp; first name just like her scottish friend use to
ask for her</b>
<br><b>My hair stood up on the back of my neck as it finally came to me
it was</b>
<br><b>her , then it went dead no dial tone no nothing . I hung up and
called</b>
<br><b>mom at work and told her of the call .. She said I was imaging I
said</b>
<br><b>Iwas not&nbsp; She came home from work and asked again I persisted
to say it</b>
<br><b>was her friend Cathy calling. The next day we went on the same way

<br><b>Abraham Lincoln</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Charlie</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have only felt
a connection with the spirit world twice. I</b>
<br><b>will only tell you one today. My family and I&nbsp; went on a trip
to</b>
<br><b>Gettysburg. I wanted to see the battlefields, Ford Theater ( I am
really</b>
<br><b>interested in Abe Lincoln and other history), and possibly a ghost.
One</b>
<br><b>night we took in a ghost story session in an old cellar. It was
pretty</b>
<br><b>spooky. The woman had already told a couple of stories. When she
came to</b>
<br><b>the end of this particular tale, she walked down the rows, showing</b>
<br><b>everyone there a really old doll. I was scared stiff. Let me explain.
I</b>
<br><b>have a " thing " with antique dolls and ventriloquist dummies. Every</b>
<br><b>time I get close to one, I sense something bad. Once I went to Alcatraz.</b>
<br><b>Throughout the whole tour, I smelled something weird and felt eyes
on my</b>
<br><b>back.I felt a strange connection somehow. By now you probably think
I'm</b>
<br><b>psychic. My third grade teacher thought I was. Maybe I am. But anyway,
I</b>
<br><b>did not want to even look at the doll. So I turned to the shelf
built</b>
<br><b>into the wall. I saw old photos of soldiers. Their eyes seemed to
look</b>
<br><b>right through me. Then I scanned the shelf again. There was a bust
of</b>
<br><b>Old Abe himself! I looked at him with his nice smile and gentle
eyes. He</b>
<br><b>seemed to be comforting me. It worked. I immediatly calmed down.
Then,</b>
<br><b>to my surprise, he winked at me!!!!! I swear this is true. I smiled
at</b>
<br><b>him. I wasn't too frightened. I knew he wouldn't scare me on purpose.</b>
<br><b>The awful doll was gone. The lady started the next story. It was
boring,</b>
<br><b>so I leaned over to the bust of Abe and whispered, " Thanks, Abe."
His</b>
<br><b>smile seemed wider, as if he was satisfied that he had gotten his</b>
<br><b>thoughtful message across.</b>

<br><b>The Supernatural in Sweden</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: ettan5@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I grew up in a small village in the very south of Sweden where there
has</b>
<br><b>been a village at least since the 1228 and the church, which is
still in</b>
<br><b>use, is even older than that. We have maybe 750 houses or some such.
The</b>
<br><b>village is roughly divided into two "blocks" with a small section
of the</b>
<br><b>wood cutting in between them. One of the playgrounds lies very near
this</b>
<br><b>wood and it was here that I saw whatever it was. When you are in
this</b>
<br><b>playground you have a few pine trees to your left through which
you can</b>
<br><b>easily see the edge of the village. Behind you are thick bushes
for a while</b>
<br><b>before you come to a house with stables and a paddock, nothing big.
On your</b>
<br><b>right is thick forest and in front of you is the path leading from
the</b>
<br><b>village into the forest. It is a gravel road, only separated from
the</b>
<br><b>playground by a few yards of pine trees that were at the time rather
thin,</b>
<br><b>and crosses the old rail way which is overgrown with small trees
and bushes</b>
<br><b>and not in use. You can see the crossing from the playground. If
you</b>
<br><b>eventually turn left you will come to the other "block". One day
when I was</b>
<br><b>7-8 years old I stayed on the playground while my friends went home
for</b>
<br><b>dinner, they would come back afterwards and so I sat there waiting
in the</b>
<br><b>slide tower, staring on nothing in the direction of the rail way.
All of a</b>
<br><b>sudden I saw a girl on a bicycle coming on the gravel road from
the village.</b>
<br><b>She stopped and stood waiting on the road. I think she had long
fair hair</b>
<br><b>and that she beckoned to me. I am not certain if she actually rang
her cycle</b>
<br><b>bell or if that is just an afterconstruction, but in some way I
knew that</b>
<br><b>she wanted me to come and I recognized her as a friend, although
I am not</b>
<br><b>sure who I mistook her for. I am fairly certain she was looking
straight at</b>
<br><b>me. I raised my hand in greeting and started walking towards her.
For a</b>
<br><b>split second she was hid behind a thin pine tree and then I didn't
see her.</b>
<br><b>I walked up to the gravel road anyway and looked around, but she
was nowhere</b>
<br><b>to be seen. There were simply no places to hide that fast but when
I had</b>
<br><b>looked around I shrugged and went back and after a while my friends
came.</b>
<br><b>Then I forgot the whole thing until I turned 17 and a discussion
around</b>
<br><b>ghosts started on my birthday party. The others told of strange
things and</b>
<br><b>some had even seen stuff on the same path where I saw the girl,
and then I</b>
<br><b>remembered it and told them. Afterwards I even wrote a well-known
woman who</b>
<br><b>finds lost things in one of our monthly journals. She answered that
it was a</b>
<br><b>girl who had died a year before in an accident but mentioned nothing
more of</b>
<br><b>why and when. This is the only "ghost", if indeed it was one, I
have ever</b>
<br><b>seen myself.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Scary Scenario</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: anonymous</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hello, my name is Jonathan I am 19 years of age. I was raised by
my granparents in South Jersey, in a little town named Glendora. When I
was 9, my granfather began to bleed to death on our living room couch.
One of his arteries ruptured reguardless of the operation he had just undergone
to help prevent this. After some time in a coma, my family took him off
of life support. strange things began to happen around our home after his
death. Lights would turn of and on. Thigs would be moved around in the
kitchen. On one occasion as I was going to bed, I saw him stand before
me for a split second. He was wearing his everyday clothes, but&nbsp; what
was strange is that he was shorter than what he actually was and his legs
faded away to the floor. After that split second he was gone. On another
occasion, me being a curious and foolish child decided to grab a box of
matches. I had the house to myself, so I bagan to light them in the kitchen.&nbsp;
I then heard shortly after, my granfathers voices say behind my right ear
"Mmm Mmm Mmm, put those back!". His voice was assuring and gentle. It still
scared the pants off me so I ran out of the house. This only scratches
the surface as far as "strange activity”.</b>

<br><b>Haunted Apartment in Mexico City</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: LopezSa@tce.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;I just find your web page and I like it, I wish you the best.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Now I want to tell you what happen to my family when we lived
in our</b>
<br><b>apartment located in the Tlatelolco Neighborhood in Mexico City,
well that</b>
<br><b>apartment is really close to the building that fell down during
the 1985</b>
<br><b>Earthquake in Mexico, so after that more strange things happen.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;First I can recall seeing about 4 ghosts, a girl (around 5
or 6 y/o), a Man</b>
<br><b>dress like the 50's style, a young man ( that maybe die during the</b>
<br><b>earthquake day, about 25-28 y/o) and somebody else.. I could feel
something</b>
<br><b>evil in the last one. We start having this kind of experiences one
day when</b>
<br><b>I came back from school, I was like.. 17 y/o ( now I'm 32) one of
my friends</b>
<br><b>lend me a record ( before the CD's) of a movie I can't remember
the name of</b>
<br><b>the Soundtrack Title, so I put in the record player, in the house
we were</b>
<br><b>only my sis ( 15 y/o) and my self, suddenly the record player needle
started</b>
<br><b>to move song by song, like if it playing an introduction of each
track... it</b>
<br><b>was really eerie.. I call my sis and I told her.. "Came and see
this!!".. my</b>
<br><b>sister start looking at me and she said that I was moving it.. so
she start</b>
<br><b>looking for some trick.. finally she open her eyes and told me ok..
I</b>
<br><b>believe you.. that happen more or less at 2:00 PM, other day we
were all the</b>
<br><b>family eating dinner when I say this little girl.. she was walking
trough</b>
<br><b>the path looking at me, I remember her face and her dress she was
so bright!</b>
<br><b>and beautiful finally she stop next to me and smile, my family was
asking me</b>
<br><b>that what was going on!.. because my face looks like if I were lost
in my</b>
<br><b>thoughts.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Other day I was in my bedroom, I was studying because I was
going to have a</b>
<br><b>test at the next day, my bed use to have a desk and the window was
behind</b>
<br><b>me, it was around 8:00 PM I could hear all my family watching TV
while I was</b>
<br><b>studying, suddenly and eerie feeling started in my back I couldn't
move</b>
<br><b>myself!!!.. I start sweating, it was hard to breath, I could feel
in my back</b>
<br><b>that "something" was watching me... after maybe 15 min. I could
move my leg,</b>
<br><b>and then I jump and run to the TV room, my dad asked me what was
going on,</b>
<br><b>and I told him that somebody was looking through the window in my
room, my</b>
<br><b>dad run to my room and he opened the window, there was nobody..</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;After the earthquake in Mexico City a lot of constructions
ends with some</b>
<br><b>damages so the city started to fix those problems, and of course
some</b>
<br><b>thieves start broken into the apartments, one of those try to broke
our</b>
<br><b>house and our neighbor in front of our door saw them, she call the
police</b>
<br><b>but she told us that suddenly this guys run out of the building,
she was</b>
<br><b>surprise because at that hour there was nobody in my house, so she
went to</b>
<br><b>out door and knock it, she said that she could hear some voices
and noise</b>
<br><b>inside the apartment, so she thought that maybe the thieves eared
that and</b>
<br><b>run, she knock again without any answer, like 30 min. later my mom
arrived</b>
<br><b>(she was the last in go, and the first in arrive to the house) and
our</b>
<br><b>neighbor called her, she told my mom what happen, so my mom open
the door</b>
<br><b>and there was nobody inside of the apartment.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;The last thing is when we moved out of that place, that day
I could feel</b>
<br><b>some sadness, my family and I we "talk" with those spirits and we
told them</b>
<br><b>that we were going and we say thanks of everything because even
they scared</b>
<br><b>us ( they move the radio stations, turn the TV on suddenly, whispering
some</b>
<br><b>nights and a lot of more things) we learn about this subject, so
we said</b>
<br><b>goodbye, some years after that I went to the same area to visit
my friends</b>
<br><b>and they told me that the new family who was living in that apartment
told</b>
<br><b>them that they couldn't sleep some nights because they could hear
somebody</b>
<br><b>crying. ( Maybe they miss us..)</b><b></b>

<br><b>Strange Encounters</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: mattphi66@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hello, my name is Matt, I'm 18, and I have a couple of strange occurences</b>
<br><b>happen to me. The first time was when i was four. I have always
been a night</b>
<br><b>owl, i hate going to bed early, and I was especially bad at age
4. I never</b>
<br><b>went to sleep when my parents took me to bed. Sometimes I would
lay in bed</b>
<br><b>and recite the abc's, and sometimes I would walk around my room
and play</b>
<br><b>with toys. One night my mom took me back to bed, said goodnight
and shut my</b>
<br><b>door. I wasn't sleepy at all of coarse, so I decided to sit up on
my bed. On</b>
<br><b>my shelf full of stuffed animals, my Alligator's big plastic eyes
started to</b>
<br><b>glow. I was paralyzed with fear, all I could do was just stand there.
He</b>
<br><b>then began to slowly approach me, saying "matthew, matthew!" in
the most</b>
<br><b>chilling voice. It started to approach me a little faster, and I
finally</b>
<br><b>yelled and screamed for my parents. I could hear my dad running
to my room,</b>
<br><b>and the second he bagan to open my door, the stuffed alligator returned
to</b>
<br><b>my shelf and he was back to normal. My parents said, "you were probably</b>
<br><b>dreaming", but I wasn't. I still have that stuffed Alligator wrapped
up in a</b>
<br><b>garbage bag in my closet. He hasn't givin me trouble since.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My second experience with the super natural
happened late one night</b>
<br><b>with a friend of mine. We were both 15, I was going to spend the
night at</b>
<br><b>his house, and at midnight or so, we decided to walk down the street
to kill</b>
<br><b>time. We walked to the elementary school, and past it around the
cemetary.</b>
<br><b>We were talking about school and football, walking along the cemetary
fence</b>
<br><b>when we saw the bushes next to us push in as though someone had
fallen into</b>
<br><b>the. We ran as fast as we could, and the movement of the bushes
followed us</b>
<br><b>step for step. When we passed the bushes we looked back and no one
was in</b>
<br><b>sight.</b>

<br><b>that lady, because there were abot 12 workers on the site, and maybe
5 of</b>
<br><b>them weared white worksuites. I had my work done and went to see
what work</b>
<br><b>lady was doing and found out, that there were no-one in the bathroom
and</b>
<br><b>sauna; there were also no ways or windows which she would got out.</b>
<br><b>On the lounch hour I asked from my co-workers if any of them had
visited</b>
<br><b>basement but answer was no. And then some of them told that they
had also</b>
<br><b>seen some strange things on the site: things had fell down without
reason,</b>
<br><b>some had also seen white weared figure and so. Nothing rally exciting,
but</b>
<br><b>still strange. Me and my friend also saw large shadow moving on
the wall,</b>
<br><b>but in the sky there where no clouds, or any possible reason for
that.</b>
<br><b>One year later I heard, that house had very long traditions of hounting.</b><b></b>
<p><b>2. Summerplace</b>
<br><b>This happened on the autumn 1992.</b>
<br><b>My friends girlfriend's parents owned an'old summerplace(built up
around</b>
<br><b>1880) on the little lake middle of woods. She had always teased
us by</b>
<br><b>telling ghoststories of that, and one saturday evening we desided
to go</b>
<br><b>there over night and see if there was anything.</b>
<br><b>(We where three guys and two girls with some wine, food and beer)</b>
<br><b>For me place seemed pretty small, and old fashioned, nothing special.</b>
<br><b>We swimmed and drank some beer and when it got dark we went in.
We searced</b>
<br><b>through the house and strangely one guy foud that one corner of
a sleeping</b>
<br><b>room felt very cold, I also tried.</b>
<br><b>Later some of us had an idea to play spiritism (we didn't know how
but tried</b>
<br><b>as in films, everyone of us had drank 4 to 10 beers)And in the beginning
we</b>
<br><b>all heard some soft knocking all around in the walls. I thought
that main</b>
<br><b>reason was that outside was getting colder and inside we had fire
in the</b>
<br><b>fireplace so house maybe little got dry or so.</b>
<br><b>We all laughed as drank a little, and played until one door flew
open very</b>
<br><b>hard with a big noise. Then one of my friends (normally pretty tough
guy)</b>
<br><b>had enough and we all, little scared drove away even any of use
was'nt</b>
<br><b>really in driving condition.</b>
<br><b>I'm not sure that there were ghosts, but sure something. That place
has also</b>
<br><b>very log traditions as a haunted house.</b><b></b>

<p><b>By: Legseleven2@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I'd like to tell you of two paranormal experiences of mine, to date
I've</b>
<br><b>never been able to explain either of them so it's nice to be able
to share</b>
<br><b>them with someone who may even be able to at least verify that such</b>
<br><b>experiences are commonly had.</b>
<br><b>My first was as a young woman - I think I was about 19 or 20.&nbsp;
I had gone to</b>
<br><b>bed at my parent's house where I lived.&nbsp; Shortly after settling
down I saw 3</b>
<br><b>circular shapes on my bedroom wall. They seemed to linger there
for a time</b>
<br><b>and then suddenly they merged into one and flew down the wall and
across my</b>
<br><b>bed. In the same instant the room lit up like sheet lightening and
then it</b>
<br><b>was over.&nbsp; I asked my parents and neighbours the next day if
anyone had</b>
<br><b>experienced anything during the night but noone had.</b>
<br><b>My first thought was that a car had come up the access road at the
back of</b>
<br><b>the house with its headlights on but there was complete silence
and when I</b>
<br><b>checked the curtains they were tightly shut, no chink of light could
have</b>
<br><b>entered from outside.&nbsp; There had certainly not been any storm
that night</b>
<br><b>either or any type of lightening or thunder.</b>
<br><b>I still think about this and I'm 39 now!&nbsp; How usual is this
type of</b>
<br><b>phenomenon - is it sometimes associated with states of mind at the
time (I</b>
<br><b>was having alot of rows with my Mother) - or could it have been
a genuine</b>
<br><b>haunting? - Our dog sometimes howled at night and once the downstairs
lights</b>
<br><b>came on by themselves when I was upstairs alone!</b>
<br><b>My second experience was about 10 or 11 years ago.&nbsp; I lived
with my then -</b>
<br><b>husband and our two children in a large bungalow (single story house)
which</b>
<br><b>had been previously occupied by a Doctor who had passed away (old
age).</b>
<br><b>I was sorting out a closet in the main bedroom when it was as if
the thought,</b>
<br><b>"Pipe tobacco" entered my head - it was more of a thought like a
memory of a</b>
<br><b>smell rather than an actual smell and it entered my head completely
out of</b>
<br><b>the blue.&nbsp; Noone in the house was a smoker and the closet I
was sorting was</b>
<br><b>new but anyway, I knew instinctively that the "smell" was not anything
in the</b>
<br><b>house or closet.</b>
<br><b>Periodically, both my husband and myself would smell strong pipe
tobacco in</b>
<br><b>various parts of the house.&nbsp; I asked my next door neighbour
whether or not</b>
<br><b>the Doctor had been a smoker but they could not say for sure although
they</b>
<br><b>did used to call him, "Smoky Joe" because he enjoyed lighting fires
in his</b>
<br><b>garden to burn the leaves which used to annoy everyone!</b>
<br><b>This bungalow had an atmosphere - I never felt comfortable there.&nbsp;
My little</b>
<br><b>boy's room used to smell terribly despite new carpets, re-decorating
and</b>
<br><b>constant cleaning.&nbsp; A damp musty smell.</b>
<br><b>Our most frightening experience in this house was shortly after
we had the</b>
<br><b>loft converted.&nbsp; Lying in bed one night my husband and I suddenly
heard what</b>
<br><b>sounded like fotsteps walking across our ceiling and alot of thumping
and</b>
<br><b>banging.&nbsp; We were so afrain that someone had broken in that
we fetched our</b>
<br><b>Alsatian dog to go up the stairs with us.&nbsp; I switched the light
on upstairs</b>
<br><b>but the walking sounds had already stopped and of course, there
was noone</b>
<br><b>there!</b>
<br><b>Other happenings in the house included a toilet that kept constantly
flushing</b>
<br><b>but stopped the instant I remarked that the plumber was coming up
the road!</b>
<br><b>Our central heating system developed more faults than I care to
mention and I</b>
<br><b>used to feel like I was being watched sometimes when I went into
the en-suite</b>
<br><b>bathroom we had converted from a small bedroom.&nbsp; I wonder if
the old Doctor</b>
<br><b>dissaproved of the alterations we had made to his home?!!</b>

<p><b>The Take Over Atempt</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: bnash@kc.rr.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My name is Brian and I have been blind from birth.
Not to be redundant,</b>
<br><b>but the readers' need to be aware of this fact, so they will understand
why</b>
<br><b>little or no visual impressions are recorded.</b>
<br><b>Back in the early nineties, my cousin and I got a good case of fishing
fever</b>
<br><b>in early January. There is a scenic and remote lake about four hours
from</b>
<br><b>our home in Kansas City. It is called Lake Taneycomo and is just
passed</b>
<br><b>Table Rock Lake, in the heart of the Ozarks, near the Arkansas Border.
It</b>
<br><b>was built in the late twenties or early thirties. It boasts some
of the best</b>
<br><b>trout fishing in the region; since the water comes in to the lake,
from</b>
<br><b>Table Rock dam, about a hundred and fifty feet below the surface.
The water,</b>
<br><b>maintains a yearly temperature, in the low fourties. There is a
town nestled</b>
<br><b>in a valley right near the lake, called Rockaway Beach. Before the
corp. of</b>
<br><b>engineers came in about fifty years ago, and restructured the dam
to make</b>
<br><b>it a trout friendly lake, the town enjoyed a brisk tourist trade.&nbsp;
Complete</b>
<br><b>with go cart tracks and a multitude of water related attractions.
But now</b>
<br><b>the tourist trade is made up mostly of serious fishermen and some
times</b>
<br><b>their families. With my cousin and me, having jobs that dealt with
the</b>
<br><b>public, it was just such a laid back environment, we were looking
for.</b>
<br><b>We arrived in the afternoon and picked out an old resort near the
water. It</b>
<br><b>was on a slight terrace and was constructed of ancient cedar, which
was</b>
<br><b>sorely in need of a coat or two of paint. Our cabin was long and
narrow,</b>
<br><b>with the kitchen and living room in the front and the bed rooms
in the back.</b>
<br><b>After a flurry of unpacking and setting up camp, we went down to
the local</b>
<br><b>restaurant for a bite to eat. After a lot of annimated discussion
over</b>
<br><b>several beers and a pizza, pertaining to techniques on catching
a trophy</b>
<br><b>rainbow or&nbsp; brown trout, we made our way back up the hill to
our cabin.&nbsp; So</b>
<br><b>as to get an early start in the morning, we decided to retire for
the</b>
<br><b>evening around midnight.</b>
<br><b>I fell a sleep thinking about the taste of fresh caught fish. I
awoke with a</b>
<br><b>start a couple of hours later. I was in a state of paralysis and
felt as if</b>
<br><b>I were levitating above the floor in a verticle position. I had
a mental</b>
<br><b>impression of a male presence behind me. It was in its mid thirties
and</b>
<br><b>boaded such a sense of loathing that my blood ran cold. It had its
arms</b>
<br><b>around my torso and seemed to be naked above the waste. He was very
muscular</b>
<br><b>and had little or no body hair. He was oafish of mind, but used
to getting</b>
<br><b>his way, by shear will power and supremacy of strength.</b>
<br><b>He tightened his arms about me, and tried to inexorably to drag
me to the</b>
<br><b>floor. His method of achieving this goal wasn't necessarily violent
or</b>
<br><b>frantic, rather it was slow and relentless. It put me in mind of
a wrestling</b>
<br><b>match under water. I&nbsp; received telepathic images of complete
physical and</b>
<br><b>mental domination. It was like a complete dismantling of my body
and soul,</b>
<br><b>alike.&nbsp; I fought him with every ounce of emotional perseverence
that I</b>
<br><b>possessed.</b>
<br><b>The test of pitting&nbsp; our will power against one another, was
incredibly</b>
<br><b>exhausting.&nbsp; I freed my arms, and spun in mid air, hitting
him in the chest</b>
<br><b>with all my might. I felt the shock of the blow clear to my elbow.</b>
<br><b>Amazingly, he didn't punch me back. However, he regained his hold
on me and</b>
<br><b>tried to continue dragging me towards the floor. Some how, I knew
if he got</b>
<br><b>me down, the monstrosity of his deeds would drive me insane. I executed
a</b>
<br><b>number of wrestling maneuvers, that my old high school coach would
have been</b>
<br><b>proud of.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Miraculously, I was free. I next was aware of lying on my
bed, amidst a</b>
<br><b>jumble of sweaty and balled up sheets. That was it for me, I beat
a hasty</b>
<br><b>retreat from the bedroom, staying up the rest of the night drinking
coffee</b>
<br><b>and contemplating the horror of my earlier episode.</b>
<br><b>Fishing was great the following day and we both caught our limit.
I told my</b>
<br><b>cousin of my experience the past evening, around a roaring bon fire
late in</b>
<br><b>the after noon. He said that he could feel a dark energy about the
place, as</b>
<br><b>well!&nbsp; I told him that I thought someone had been either raped
or killed</b>
<br><b>there years ago. And that maybe the cabin retained the horror of
this by</b>
<br><b>gone event. We turned in around the same time that evening.</b>
<br><b>My sleep was fitful to say the least, as I was on, "phantom pervert
patrol,"</b>
<br><b>all night long.</b>
<br><b>Nothing out of the ordinary happened for the remainder of the trip.
We went</b>
<br><b>home with over fifty fish. But the spector of this ghoulish experience,</b>
<br><b>haunted me for a long time. I had an abnormal number of nightmares
over the</b>
<br><b>next few months, although the spector did not show its self. But
I felt that</b>
<br><b>it was some how responsible for my bad dreams.</b>
<br><b>My wife and I went down to Rock Away Beech some years later. We
walked down</b>
<br><b>to the resort where not long before, I had wrestled with a demon
for my life</b>
<br><b>and sanity. As we drew near the cabin, her grip tightened on my
arm. She</b>
<br><b>told me that it had a very spooky look about it. She said that the
scant</b>
<br><b>number of trees that grew close to it were twisted and gnarled.
there were a</b>
<br><b>lot of birds in the region, but the area around that resort was
strangely</b>
<br><b>free of bird or any animal life. We avoided that resort for the
rest of our</b>
<br><b>trip.</b>
<br><b>As I was putting this story on paper, a couple of hours ago; my
computer</b>
<br><b>about half way through the writing, went dead. I had to reboot,
which is a</b>
<br><b>laborious task, given all of the speech compatible software and
adaptive</b>
<br><b>equipment. Could the entity of which I wrote, have a contact in
Kansas City?</b>
<br><b>I'll let you be the judge!</b>

<p><b>UNCLASSIFIED:-ghost?</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: anonymous</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I have been visiting your site for about a year and had intended</b>
<br><b>to send you a few experiences but never had the time.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;A recent event has spurred me to write this.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Several weeks</b>
<br><b>ago an A4T Skyhawk jet crashed on the airfield. As all of the Navy
staff were</b>
<br><b>"Stood Down" (day off) for the day leaving myself and two other
army medics on</b>
<br><b>duty we had the task of manning the crash response ambulances, we
were</b>
<br><b>dispatched to the site of the incident immediately after the crash
alarm was</b>
<br><b>raised. On arrival at the site there was a 700 meter rent in the
scrub and low</b>
<br><b>trees, not much was left of the A4 as it went in inverted at about
600 kts. We</b>
<br><b>started a search for the pilot in the event that he ejected as no
witnesses</b>
<br><b>could verify this, the search was quickly curtailed as minor body
parts were</b>
<br><b>found in the wreckage. A search was commenced to locate the rest
of the human</b>
<br><b>remains, while doing this something happened that I did not realise
untill later</b>
<br><b>was truly unusual, I noticed a man wearing a flight suit walking
amongst the</b>
<br><b>derbies coming towards us from&nbsp; a few meters further along
the strewn wreckage,</b>
<br><b>I did not take much notice as by this time the investigation team
with the fire</b>
<br><b>fighters had arrived, I thought he was a Kiwi investigator from
the squadron</b>
<br><b>that the A4 belongd to.</b>
<br><b>At this time we were notified of a possible dangerous substance
exposed in the</b>
<br><b>wreckage and were removed to a rally point untill a conformation
that the scene</b>
<br><b>was safe. While waiting with the crash team I realised that the
person in the</b>
<br><b>flight suit was not with us, I then told the Incident controller
that this</b>
<br><b>person was not with us and may still be in the scene, he conferred
with the</b>
<br><b>Investigation team and then with the fire team, no one had bought
a flight</b>
<br><b>suited member with them! as we were the only other team it was impossible
for</b>
<br><b>another person to be there, I put it down to the smoke in the air
at the time</b>
<br><b>and it must have been one of the fire fighters.</b>
<br><b>Later on I was thinking about this `Mystery' person , I was certain
he was in a</b>
<br><b>flight suit, I saw him clearly enough to give a description, so
I went over to</b>
<br><b>the investigators and told the story to them, they remained adamant
that all</b>
<br><b>personnel were accounted for and no one was wearing a flight suit.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; We had set up a command post for the scene, in the tent were
the chief</b>
<br><b>investigator and his team, I came in to see what was happening as
we wanted to</b>
<br><b>continue with the remains search, It may sound bad but we were worried
that wild</b>
<br><b>animals may remove some body parts as the majority of what we had&nbsp;
found was no</b>
<br><b>larger than the palm of your hand.</b>
<br><b>I noticed&nbsp; the `pers' file of the deceased was on the desk
for identification if</b>
<br><b>it were possible, there&nbsp; on the file was a photo of the man
in the flight suit,</b>
<br><b>there was no mistaking him, the pilot killed in the crash was the
man I had seen</b>
<br><b>at the site! I couldn't say a thing staring at the photo wide eyed,
the guy at</b>
<br><b>the table asked me what was wrong.</b>
<br><b>I was stunned , what could I say? So I said what any soldier would
say,</b>
<br><b>nothing, then walked out.</b>
<br><b>This is the first time since that night I have said anything about
this to</b>
<br><b>anyone. I will Not tell anyone I work with as this sort of thing
is not accepted</b>
<br><b>readily and I would be ridiculed by my workmates, and possibly referred
to a</b>
<br><b>psychologist for a review.</b>
<br><b>I do not know why I saw him, if he wanted anything, did he have
a message? I</b>
<br><b>don't know.</b>

it. At</b>
<br><b>first it was&nbsp; just stuff you thought that maybe you remembered

living in</b>
<br><b>the house for at least 2 years before we started to compare notes.
As we</b>
<br><b>started to talk about experiences we both had gone though it was</b>

<br><b>Hometown</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: nosouvenirs@hotmail.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>In an old run down house in a small northern town an evil presence
can be</b>
<br><b>felt from the second floor dining room to the third floor.&nbsp;
I first</b>
<br><b>encountered the spirit when I was thirteen years old.&nbsp; As I
entered the</b>
<br><b>second floor dining room I felt a strange chill that I passed off
as the</b>
<br><b>house being old and drafty.&nbsp; As I approached the stairs to
the third floor,</b>
<br><b>I felt that feeling that you get when someone is waiting for you
just out of</b>
<br><b>your sight.&nbsp; Thinking someone had snuck in to the house and
gone upstairs, I</b>
<br><b>ran up the stairs, only to find nobody there.&nbsp; As I walked
back down, I felt</b>
<br><b>the weight of footsteps following me and slight pressure on my shoulder,
as</b>
<br><b>though someone were about to push me down the stairs.&nbsp; I re-visited
the</b>
<br><b>house at the ages of fifteen, eighteen, twenty and twenty-four.&nbsp;
Each time I</b>
<br><b>would feel an angry energy waiting for me at the top of the stairs,
and feel</b>
<br><b>the pressure of footsteps behind me and a hand on my shoulder as
I rushed</b>
<br><b>down, with the exception of my last visit.&nbsp; On that visit,
I still felt the</b>
<br><b>presence in the hall, but it did not seem as angry and did not follow
me</b>
<br><b>down the steps.&nbsp; For years I passed the whole thing off as
a figment of my</b>
<br><b>very vivid and active imagination.&nbsp; I never believed in ghosts
anyway.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>changed my mind one day during a visit to my parents' house.&nbsp;
I was staying</b>
<br><b>with them during a break from college, and I'd started telling them
about</b>
<br><b>some of the ghost legends at my school.&nbsp; My Dad shared some
of his ghost</b>
<br><b>stories from our home state, so I mentioned the incidents in the
old house</b>
<br><b>in my hometown.&nbsp; Both of my parents had similar experiences
of feeling an</b>
<br><b>angry presence and feeling watched and unwanted.&nbsp; A few months
ago my aunt</b>
<br><b>told me that she had experienced this as well.</b><b></b>

<br><b>North Wales Mountains</b><b></b>
<p><b>BY: DaveHowarth2001@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>My names Dave and I'm 27 yrs old. I live near the mountains of the
Offas Dyke</b>
<br><b>footpath in North Wales. When I was 13, I was out with my friend
on the</b>
<br><b>mountains and I realised I had forgotten something. I knew I must
have left</b>
<br><b>it at the caves, that we had just visited, about a 100 yard walk
down a steep</b>
<br><b>footpath. Being in good "spirits" I was whistling as I was walking
down</b>
<br><b>towards the caves. As I approached the caves, something told me
to lookup. I</b>
<br><b>looked at what appeared to be an elderley Woman who was holding
a whicker</b>
<br><b>basket and appeared to be doing the motions of washing her clothes.
Now, the</b>
<br><b>water that comes of of these caves is only about a foot wide and
1/2 an inch</b>
<br><b>deep, and I could even see right through her and see the markings
on the cave</b>
<br><b>wall. I FROZE! I then decided after what felt like ages to run back
up the</b>
<br><b>mountain to tell my mate "look at this!". Needless to say, he thought
I was</b>
<br><b>bonkers when I told him and no-one was there when we revisited the

<br><b>this day I have always wondered what this means, if anything. I

<br><b>Fast Asleep</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Angelchild2283@cs.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I've been having strange expariences since I was a small child, I
would hear</b>
<br><b>whispers by my bed and I would have the same nightmare every night
that these</b>
<br><b>creatures were carying me all around my house,but it was when I
was a</b>
<br><b>teenager(about 15-17) that the real weird things started happening,I
would be</b>
<br><b>in bed at night and all of a sudden my entire body would become
paralized, to</b>
<br><b>the point where I couldn't even twitch a finger or blink an eye.It
lasted</b>
<br><b>only a few seconds but it was enough to scare me half to death!
The first</b>
<br><b>time it happened I ran upstairs and told my mother and she told
me to throw</b>
<br><b>away all my rock albums, and I did, but it kept happening,and it
kept getting</b>
<br><b>worse, it sounds weird but one time I heard myself scream inside
myself,and</b>
<br><b>the worst time of all the paralysis came on me so fast and so hard,and
my</b>
<br><b>eyes were wide open(that didn't happen often) and I just layed there,
I could</b>
<br><b>make out on my ceiling two images of what looked like small animals
laying</b>
<br><b>down(only upsidedown) on it. I imediately started praying in my
head and out</b>
<br><b>from the bottom of my bedroom door a bright light began to shine,it
lit up</b>
<br><b>the whole room,at the time I thought my mother must have just snapped
on the</b>
<br><b>hall light but then it all stopped at once, I could move again,
the strange</b>
<br><b>images were gone and the light went out, so naturaly I jumped out
of bed and</b>

<p><b>My Cemetery Experience</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: CaNiBuSiZgOd74@cs.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>Sometime during the summer last year when I was 14 (am 15 now), me
and two of</b>
<br><b>my closest friends decieded to explore a cemetary that we had seen
some</b>
<br><b>unusual things in. I was the first one to enter and we all crouched
in a</b>
<br><b>circle and said a prayer. We then proceeded north into the cemetary,
and</b>
<br><b>immediately went off the past towards the North-western part of
the</b>
<br><b>graveyard, where it was really wooded. I looked around for a good
place to</b>
<br><b>take a picture, when my friend jumped forward and spun around and
got into a</b>
<br><b>fighting stance, after realizing noone was there he put his hands
down and</b>
<br><b>rubbed the back of his head, i then quickly took a picture and asked
him what</b>
<br><b>was wrong. He said he felt like something struck him in the back
of the head,</b>
<br><b>none of us believed him (he was the joking type) so we just excused
it as him</b>
<br><b>acting funny trying to scare us. I then headed West and turned on
my recorder</b>
<br><b>and placed it on a grave from the early 1900's. I then drew my flashlight
as</b>
<br><b>i was walking into a low-lying level of the graveyard where it looked
like</b>
<br><b>tombs (I'm not sure if there are names for them, just stone boxes
placed in</b>
<br><b>the ground, with a real heavy lid) was being pushed up from the
surface by</b>
<br><b>the water that collects there regularly. A fine mist was starting
to grow</b>
<br><b>into an almost black cloud. We then neared a statue of Jesus Christ
with his</b>
<br><b>hands in prayer and his head bowed. I also noticed that how all
the other</b>
<br><b>tombstones were eroded this one seemed to be unchanged by the weather
despite</b>
<br><b>it being put there very early on, i just said to myself it was made
or marble</b>
<br><b>or something. But then i started getting tremors when i was nearing
a tomb</b>
<br><b>that was almost completely sticking out of the ground, and wanted
to turn and</b>
<br><b>run but i was drawn to it, it looked so old, and i thought that
surely</b>
<br><b>something would show up in the picture so i took two. I then turned
back away</b>
<br><b>from the tomb and went to the enterance and waited, when we all
regrouped and</b>
<br><b>headed home on the way there I was having an unusual feeling, you
see ever</b>
<br><b>since i was i child my grandmother believed I could detect evil
and good, and</b>
<br><b>tell the diffrence between people, i used to look at the person
and tell my</b>
<br><b>parents if they had good eye or evil eyes, my mother told me to
stop being</b>
<br><b>rude and eventually this power that i believed i had, vanished and
i never</b>
<br><b>used it again. But i was getting the same feeling walking down the
road, like</b>
<br><b>hatred, a hatred so strong that it was boring into my brain, then
i started</b>
<br><b>feeling it surround me like a darkness, then i began to shiver.
After another</b>
<br><b>few hundred yards, it began to clear up and the pain that the evil
was, was</b>
<br><b>slowly fading away. By the time i got home i felt quite good, the
rest of the</b>
<br><b>night we were up till two taking pictures of us doing stupid things.
and i</b>
<br><b>got the pictures developed the next morning, and this is what i
found.</b>
<br><b>The picture that i took of my friend rubbing his head, it looked
as if a</b>
<br><b>whispy object was staring at him, i could detect it's eyes, although
noone</b>
<br><b>else i've shown the picture to noticed this, but it seemed to be
caring,</b>
<br><b>almost as if it was trying to help him in someway, and in the back,
i saw a</b>
<br><b>small orb. It was a deep blue, the deepest blue i'd ever seen and
it looked</b>
<br><b>evil, almost threatening.</b>
<br><b>The picture that i took of the tomb, looked as if threads were coming
from</b>
<br><b>the cracks in the tomb.</b>
<br><b>And one picture caught my interest, it was a picture of me standing
my my</b>
<br><b>dinner table, drinking a bottle of coke, when i looked like two
deep</b>
<br><b>reddish-blue whispy like strands stood outside the porch door. Almost
looked</b>
<br><b>as if it was evil, but not evil in a threating way, just evil. No
other word</b>
<br><b>to describe it. I also experienced a violent tremor when i was laying
in bed</b>
<br><b>around three, as if something was shaking me, but that was it. I
wonder if</b>
<br><b>that night something evil had followed me home.</b><b></b>

<br><b>My Ghost Story</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: goochy18@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp; Well it all started February 23, 2001 (Saturday) at 1:44a.m.
, only 30minutes after I went to bed.&nbsp; I was lying in the next room
and the computer room is located right next door to my room. My that time,
the computer was in its "sleep stage".&nbsp; But then I heard the internet
getting connected.&nbsp; I looked at the crack under my door and the blue
light my the computer screen was on. I picked up the phone and sure enough,
the internet had been connected.&nbsp; I looked once more under the door
and then a shadow passed under the door and passed back as if entering
the computer room again.&nbsp; I waited a while and then picked up the
phone again and this time it was the regular dial tone. So I wonder if
it could have been my parents,&nbsp; it wasn't. After about 5 minutes,
the internet had been connected again and this time I distinctly heard
the sounds coming from the next room. I looked once more under the door
and the shadow passed, but it stopped momentarily in front of my door.&nbsp;
My dog's ears stood up as he was awakened and then after the shadow passed
back, (entering the computer room again) the dog calmly lied back down.
The next morning, my mom asked me what I had done to the computer because
it was completely messed up. There were so many errors and the computer
had been restarted and ran in "safe-mode." The only we know of computers
running in safe mode is by turning them off suddenly and then restarting
the systems.&nbsp; My parents think I'm crazy, and maybe I am, but I do
believe that I have a presence in my home.</b><b></b>

<p><b>GRANDPA</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: JUMPSTREET75@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>My grandfather became very ill with cancer when I was about 3 years
old.</b>
<br><b>Although I do not recall any memories of him, home movies, pictures,
and</b>
<br><b>stories from my mother tell me that we were very close.&nbsp; He
would come over</b>
<br><b>to the house and play with me for hours.&nbsp; I was his special
little guy, and I</b>
<br><b>am told we had a wonderful three years together.</b>
<br><b>After being hospitalized to attempt to treat the cancer, it was
determined</b>
<br><b>that all that could be done was, and he would soon pass.&nbsp; I
am told that my</b>
<br><b>grandfather wanted to come back home to spend his final days in
his own bed</b>
<br><b>surrounded by the people he loved.&nbsp; We visited him everyday
until he</b>
<br><b>eventually succumbed to the cancer.&nbsp; He crossed over in his
own home, his own</b>
<br><b>bed, and in the company of his loved ones.</b>
<br><b>Several years later at the age of about 10 or 11 I would spend weekends
at my</b>
<br><b>grandmas house during the summer.&nbsp; The room my grandfather
had passed away in</b>
<br><b>was now the guest room where I slept.&nbsp; I had been in that room
many times</b>
<br><b>before and never experienced anything out of the ordinary.&nbsp;
Until one night</b>
<br><b>late in the summer, something happened.</b>
<br><b>When I slept, I played a radio next to the bed, a small clock radio
to keep</b>
<br><b>me company.&nbsp; It was tuned to a local talk radio station that
played old time</b>
<br><b>radio shows which I loved to listen to.&nbsp; I had been in bed
about an hour,</b>
<br><b>engrossed in a mystery program from the days before television.&nbsp;
The room</b>
<br><b>around me was dark and the door to the living room was open.&nbsp;
Through the</b>
<br><b>door a faint glow from a small nightlite plugged into the wall gave
shape to</b>
<br><b>some of the objects in my room, the dresser, the chair in the corner,
and the</b>
<br><b>radio next to the bed.&nbsp; I closed my eyes to immerse myself
in the radio</b>
<br><b>program when suddenly it went silent.&nbsp; I opened my eyes and
looked over at</b>
<br><b>the little black box to see what had happened.&nbsp; The red dot
on the front</b>
<br><b>indicated that it was still on but it was eerily silent.</b>
<br><b>Out of the corner of my eye I saw something move by the door.&nbsp;
My first</b>
<br><b>thought was my grandmother.&nbsp; She often got up in the middle
of the night to</b>
<br><b>have a glass of water.&nbsp; I looked at the open door more intently
and saw the</b>
<br><b>figure slowly glide around the corner.&nbsp; I could not see any
features, only a</b>
<br><b>dark outline of a very tall and large person.&nbsp; I was frightened
to the point</b>
<br><b>of panic but did not move.&nbsp; The figure drifted into the room
and paused at</b>
<br><b>the foot of the bed.&nbsp; I didn't know why at the time but I became
very calm.</b>
<br><b>A feeling of security washed over me and I just watched him standing
there.</b>
<br><b>He moved very slowly to the side of the bed and stood next to me.&nbsp;
I remember</b>
<br><b>that he should have been blocking my view of the radio but I saw
the little</b>
<br><b>red light right through him.&nbsp; He bent over and reached for
me, my hand</b>
<br><b>suddenly becoming icy.&nbsp; I looked to his face to see my grandfather
smiling</b>
<br><b>softly at me.&nbsp; He stood and went toward the door and just as
he disappeared</b>
<br><b>around the corner my mystery show came right back on just in time
to hear the</b>
<br><b>ending.</b>
<br><b>I never told anyone about my experience until 2 years ago.&nbsp;
The topic of</b>
<br><b>ghosts came up one night during a discussion with my sister Karen
who is 2</b>
<br><b>years older than me.&nbsp; She too spent a good deal of time with
grandpa and has</b>
<br><b>some memories of him.&nbsp; As I relayed this story to her, the
only person I had</b>
<br><b>ever told, she began to cry.&nbsp; I asked her what the matter was
and her answer</b>
<br><b>shocked me.&nbsp; She told me that the same summer I had my vision,
she to saw</b>
<br><b>grandpa.&nbsp; He appeared in the same room, and did the same thing
as in my</b>
<br><b>experience.</b>
<br><b>My mother has told me and my other 4 siblings that all of us have
a guardian</b>
<br><b>angel watching over us.&nbsp; They are all family members who have
crossed over</b>
<br><b>and have been assigned to keep us safe.&nbsp; I guess grandpa is
pulling double</b>
<br><b>duty.</b>

<p><b>&nbsp;Changed My Life</b><b></b>

<p><b>&nbsp;My husband, my daughter</b>
<br><b>and myself&nbsp; live in a two story building&nbsp; on the second
floor in Pasadena,</b>
<br><b>California. About five years ago my husband and I heard foot steps
or</b>
<br><b>someone running outside, just below our bedroom window. What caught
my</b>
<br><b>attention was the fact that I believe were a toddler's foot steps.
I became</b>
<br><b>very concern because it was around 2:00 AM when this activity happens
I also</b>
<br><b>heard what sounded a little boy giggling. I thought for sure this
little boy</b>
<br><b>has gotten out without the parents knowing about it. But when I
got outside</b>
<br><b>there was nobody there. For 5 years we heard the same thing at the
same time</b>
<br><b>night after night. My husband would even stay awake looking out
the window</b>
<br><b>to&nbsp; see if he could actually see something&nbsp; but we never
did, the moment we</b>
<br><b>would be in bed we would hear it.&nbsp; It stopped all of a sudden

<p><b>In Memory of My Father</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: AZMOD73@email.msn.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I really do not share my story with really anyone but felt compelled
to do so.&nbsp; This is a story about my father.&nbsp; My mom kept me from
him for the first 15 years of my life.&nbsp; I decided I needed to be with
him and get to know him.&nbsp; In all this time I didn't quite know how
to be a daughter to him so I did the best I can.&nbsp;&nbsp; I loved my
father and I always knew we had a special connection considering the years
of distance that were between us.&nbsp; Well I had 6 short years with him
and a lot of regrets of what I did and how I should of been a daughter.&nbsp;
When I found out that my father was going to die is when I was pregnant
with my first daughter and my dad's first grandchild.&nbsp; My father hung
on long enough to see her be brought home on Jan 26 1992 and was coherent
for her arrival.&nbsp; Which would be the last day of his life that he
would be coherent.&nbsp; It was hell to see my father die.&nbsp; Something
I still cry about almost all the time.&nbsp; But to get back to the story.&nbsp;
My father's life ended on February 12, 1992.</b>
<br><b>That night I went to bed knowing something was wrong.&nbsp; I woke
around 3 am in the morning.&nbsp; I lived in an entirely different house
than my dying father.&nbsp; But anywise I woke up to see I ghostly white
figure about 6 feet tall (the size of my father) floating.&nbsp; He came
to tell me goodbye and that he would protect me and my children.&nbsp;
He did not appear in front of any other relatives.&nbsp; At least they
haven't told me.&nbsp; I was very calm during this and happy.</b>
<br><b>I got the call the next morning from my stepmom that my dad had
died the night before.&nbsp; I responded to her telling her that I already
knew.&nbsp; I also told her the exact time he died.&nbsp; I think she was
floored.</b>
<br><b>Well to this day my father is with me.&nbsp; I feel him and he has
saved my life from incredible illness and he has saved my son's life from
illness.&nbsp; He truly is still by father and a grandfather who is in
guardian angel form.</b>

a little bit. In that little bit of</b>

<br><b>Story To Tell</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: sjg@sdc.org</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hi. I was just surfing the net and found your page. I do have a true
story to tell.</b>
<br><b>When I was going to college (NMSU) in Las Cruces NM, I worked at
the White Sands Missile Range as a computer operator....on the grave yard
shift. Anyway, one night I had my shoes off and was taking a snooze (we
were not suppossed to but no one else was around). One of my duties was
to check the temperature in a computer room waaaaaaay down at the other
end of the converted hanger.</b>
<br><b>So at about 2 in the morning I put on my shoes and did not tie them
since I was just gonna take them off and sleep again. I walked down the
semi dark corridor went into the computer room, checked the temp, wrote
it in the log and went back out again. As I was walking I looked down and
saw that my shoe laces had been tied together...like kids would do as a
prank...so the person would try to walk and trip...the left shoe lace was
tied to the right shoe lace.</b>
<br><b>I quickly untied them and looked around as the hair on the back
of my neck stood on end. Needless to say I ran back to my usual spot and
did not sleep the rest of the night.</b><b></b>

<p><b>I have had many ghost encounters in my short lifetime.&nbsp; I am
only 15 but i</b>
<br><b>have seen a lot of weird creepy things.&nbsp; Most of these occurances
occured in</b>
<br><b>my own house.&nbsp; It all started when i was around 8.&nbsp; I
had just moved into my</b>
<br><b>new house.&nbsp; After a month or two weird things began to happen.&nbsp;
Mostly i just</b>
<br><b>heard things, like doors or closets closing, when they really didn't.&nbsp;
It</b>
<br><b>wasnt until later when i really saw something strange.&nbsp; I awoke
because of a</b>
<br><b>feeling, like i was being watched.&nbsp; When i turned over to look
around i saw</b>
<br><b>an old man standing in the corner of my room.&nbsp; He wasnt like
the casper</b>
<br><b>ghost, he wasnt see through, thats what was scariest.&nbsp; He looked
like a</b>
<br><b>normal person.&nbsp; Of course i dunked under my covers until i
fell asleep.&nbsp; Of</b>
<br><b>course my parents didnt believe me, they told me it was just my
imagination.</b>
<br><b>This was until a neighboor asked my parents about my house.&nbsp;
The truth was</b>
<br><b>that the people who lived in my house before me also saw things.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This happened until a few years ago.&nbsp;
I still see things but not as</b>
<br><b>often.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One scary thing that happened not
to long ago was really scary.&nbsp; By</b>
<br><b>now i have my room downstairs after my parents finally believed
me.&nbsp; One</b>
<br><b>night when i was laying down something happened.&nbsp; I normally
leave the bible</b>
<br><b>on my headboard open, its the only thing that i feel safe with,
but because i</b>
<br><b>had been cleaning it was closed.&nbsp; When i reached back to open
it a noise came</b>
<br><b>from every where in my room.&nbsp; It shook my room.&nbsp; It was
a noise that cannot</b>
<br><b>be discribed but it was definitly not human.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As you can tell from some of my many

<br><b>Something I Thought I Dreamed</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: trucknutus@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About 17 yrs. ago Ihad an experience that keeps
haunting me to this day. I was 18 at the time, And lived at home in my
parents old farm house. I was working 2nd. shift at a local factory . On
this day in particular I had this strange feeling in the pit of my stomach.
I guess the only way to describe ot is to say it was a vey eerie feeling.
I just couldnt get rid of it. It was about 11:00pm when I got home from
work, And I sat there talking with my parents for about 15 minutes. They
went to bed and I stayed up to watch TV. While watching TV I got hungry,so
I walked into the kitchen to get something to eat. I walked up to the sink
and looked out the window. I turned to my right to walk over to the refrigerator.
As I turned there was this green hazy figure standing right in front of
me. It was about 6 inches off of the ground and about 4 feet tall. I turned
and ran upstairs aand hid under my blanket. Eventually I thought I had
made it up or dreamed it</b><b></b>

<br><b>She came to say Goodbye</b><b></b>

<p><b>November 16, was my granparents 54th anniversery, and my grandfathers
Birthday. while my grandpa was cleaning the house for gramma, she went
shopping and too the beauty parlor to get her hair done. While coming from
the beauty parlor she was struck by a truck while crossing the street.</b>
<br><b>While not having any broken bones, she fell over and bumped her
head. Ihe was out instinaiously (i want to belive she felt no pain) by
5 o'clock when i got to the hospitol, grandpa said she wasn't going to
make it. iIwent in and saw her she moved and breathed hard when i touched
her hair and said I loved her. I pledded with her to fight it and her arms
where shaking she was trying, but she was tired, I said</b>
<br><b>"grammy if you are to tired to fight i understand. I just have to
see you on the other side." Her arms stopped shaking and she was peaceful.</b>
<br><b>They took her off the breathing machine and she was breathing when
I left. That night i could not get her off my mind, i couldn't sleep, but
driffted here and there. i guess at one point i did get to a semi dream
like state. and she was there! she was all in white, she was old but she
didn't look like she did the week before, her skin was less wrinkely, her
hair has a certain shimmer to it, and she was smiling. I had so many things
to ask her, what she wanted to wear, etc(i went shopping with her every
saturday and she was always saying what goes to who and what she wants
done when she died. no big deal) but all i could do was pleed with her
to wake up. she had a cute little laugh and she laughed and said you know
what is going to happen, i can't do that. she told me to not worry about
grandpas, he was going to be fine.</b>
<br><b>the next moring i felt she had already gone, but i felt good about
the "dream" dad called and said they where at the hospitol and she was
fading. my kids wanted to get the chance to say goodbye but just couldn't
bring them selves to go in the room. after that she died. it is very strange
when someone dies. the air in the room changed, it was electrical, like
heavy and buzzing. and we new she was gone.</b>
<br><b>when we went back to the housewe where trying to decide what she
was going to wear, them my dad's wife found her plans for the funeral,
she had a white suit and white blouse that she wanted to wear. lol, maybe
she was telling me that in the "dream", i dunno. but many have shared their
experiences, i apoplogize for the length, may be i am still trying to come
to terms with this. she was 80 years old, great health, she smoked all
of her life and her lungs where clear and healthy. and she died November
17, 2000 from head trauma caused by being hit by a truck.</b>
<br><b>Since her death there has been a peacful air to our house. the summer
before my gram pasted, my daughter was seeing an apparition of a boy everywhere
she went, even in our house!! since Gram passed, I can't help but wonder
if maybe she is keeping a look out for us. Also, I have to add, that I
used to take her shopping on Satyrday mornings, she would always sit in
the passenger seat. Every now and again i will see her out of the corner
of my eye, sitting there, enjoying the ride.</b>
<br><b>In conclusion, is there a great beyond? is she visiting me?? I dunno.
But I will tell you that it has made mr stop and think, maybe there is
indeed a heaven, maybe she is comming to check on us, and MAYBE she is
happy in the place she is now.</b>

We checked the house and found nothing.</b>
<br><b>In our youngest son's room, who is two, things have been moved and
lights have turned on once he is asleep.&nbsp; They are comfort things
such as a pillow put in his bed and a night light turned on.&nbsp; These
are not things he can do by himself.</b>
<br><b>One other occurance was during the day when my wife was cleaning
the kitchen.&nbsp; She cleaned the glass oven door but returned about one
half later to find a child's hand print in the middle of the door.&nbsp;
Please note that both of our boys were not home at the time.</b>
<br><b>We have no idea what to make of these experiences.&nbsp; We feel
safe but unsure.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Our Apartment</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: dmv6@rocketmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>My boyfriend, our 18 month old son and I moved into a</b>
<br><b>new apartment about 3 months ago.&nbsp; We had never heard</b>
<br><b>of a haunted apartment before this, but we now believe</b>
<br><b>that such things exist.&nbsp; As far as we know, no one</b>
<br><b>died in our apartment, but there was a building in the</b>
<br><b>same complex abour 100 yards away that burned down</b>
<br><b>over 15 years ago, and some people died in the fire.</b>
<br><b>It all started a few weeks after we moved in, my</b>
<br><b>boyfriend had put our son in bed and we were going to</b>
<br><b>bed ourselves. Our bedroom has a door that connects it</b>
<br><b>to my son's room. We were lying in bed, and we all of</b>
<br><b>a sudden we heard the distinct sound of a door</b>
<br><b>slamming.&nbsp; The sound came from the door to our son's</b>
<br><b>room. I was terrified and so was he.&nbsp; We got out of</b>
<br><b>bed, checked on the baby, and then proceeded to look</b>
<br><b>around the apartment thinking that maybe there was an</b>
<br><b>intruder.&nbsp; We couldn't find any trace of an intruder,</b>
<br><b>and the doors were locked and deadbolted.&nbsp; We slept</b>
<br><b>with the lights on that night.&nbsp; A few days later my</b>
<br><b>keys came up missing.&nbsp; I didn't make the association</b>
<br><b>until later.&nbsp; I have since learned that ghosts like</b>
<br><b>babies and small children, and like to play tricks...</b>
<br><b>such as stealing keys.&nbsp; The same day that I discovered</b>
<br><b>my keys were missing, my boyfriend's mother came to</b>
<br><b>visit and she brought her small dog.&nbsp; He was sitting</b>
<br><b>on the floor next to the couch.&nbsp; My boyfriend nudged</b>
<br><b>me and indicated that I should look at the dog.&nbsp; He</b>
<br><b>was watching something move around the room.&nbsp; We</b>
<br><b>watched him for 15 minutes as he followed whatever it</b>
<br><b>was with his eyes.&nbsp; He then suddenly yelped and jumped</b>
<br><b>back as if he was kicked.&nbsp; We were all spooked.&nbsp; The</b>
<br><b>next day I made coffee in our kitchen and walked to</b>
<br><b>the bedroom where my son was playing.&nbsp; When I came</b>
<br><b>back into the kitchen 5 minutes later to pour myself a</b>
<br><b>cup, coffee had been poured all over the counter and</b>
<br><b>the pot was on the burner.&nbsp; No one else was in the</b>
<br><b>house.&nbsp; Since these occurrences, we decided to get a</b>
<br><b>dog.&nbsp; She sleeps with us on our bed, but at night she</b>
<br><b>stares into the hall intently.&nbsp; My son wakes up</b>
<br><b>screaming in the middle of the night, which he had not</b>
<br><b>done since he was 9 months old.&nbsp; At night you hear</b>
<br><b>footsteps in my hallway.&nbsp; And just yesterday I got my</b>
<br><b>keys back.&nbsp; I was very upet about them missing because</b>
<br><b>in addition to being important keys, it had a keychain</b>
<br><b>on it that I recieved the day my son was born and it</b>
<br><b>has a deep sentimental value to me.&nbsp; We went to sleep</b>
<br><b>the night before last after cleaning the living room</b>
<br><b>and our son's room.&nbsp; The living room was spotless.</b>
<br><b>That next morning I woke to find the keys sitting on</b>
<br><b>the middle of the couch.&nbsp; They had not been there</b>
<br><b>previously.&nbsp; When my boyfriend got home from work I</b>
<br><b>asked him where he had found my keys and he said it</b>
<br><b>wasn't him that had put them there.&nbsp; Our son hadn't</b>
<br><b>even been awake yet when I found them.&nbsp; We're hoping</b>
<br><b>that there will be no more supernatural occurences,</b>
<br><b>but when you hear the footsteps at night, I&nbsp; only</b>
<br><b>think it must be a matter of time.</b><b></b>

<br><b>My Haunting Story</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: elycium@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Greetings, My name is Elycium.&nbsp; I thought perhaps I'd share
my story with</b>
<br><b>you, as perhaps you are some of the few people who would even believe
me.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; It happened when I was eight years old, but everything
is still vivid in</b>
<br><b>my memory.&nbsp; I had woken up very early in the morning, it was
still dark out.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; My three sisters, whom I shared the room with were still
alseep, so the</b>
<br><b>possiblitiy of a npise waking me up was out, since I'm the heaviest
sleeper.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; I looked around and on my closet wall were hundreds of glowing
eyes,</b>
<br><b>staring at me, and from the ceiling as well.&nbsp; I closed my eyes
and slowly</b>
<br><b>opened them, to make sure it just wasnt a trick of the light, but
they were</b>
<br><b>still there.&nbsp; Then I looked out into the hall way.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A boy, maybe 16-17 years old stood there, watching
me.&nbsp; He had long</b>
<br><b>hair, which was pulled back, and was wearing farmer like clothing.&nbsp;
He was</b>
<br><b>extremely pale, almost transparent.&nbsp; He smiled at me, then
walked awa down</b>
<br><b>the hall.&nbsp; But I know that he couldn't have walked because
the floorboards</b>
<br><b>creak under even the slightest wait and they didn't make a sound.&nbsp;
So I went</b>
<br><b>to look and nothing was there.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Later, when I was 12 I learned the history of my house
from our next door</b>
<br><b>neighbor.&nbsp; She told us how when our town was just starting
out it had been a</b>
<br><b>farming community (it still sorta is today, grapes, strawberries,
ect) and</b>
<br><b>that our house and her house had been connected at one point in
that time.</b>
<br><b>The family that had lived there had one son.&nbsp; She told me that
the son was</b>
<br><b>"crazy" experimenting on animals and things like that.&nbsp; The
people tried to</b>
<br><b>lock him up twice but both times the boy escaped, returning home.&nbsp;
So the</b>
<br><b>family placed him under house arrest in his room.&nbsp; While he
was alive he</b>
<br><b>would claw at the walls, trying to get out, and eventually he died.&nbsp;
The</b>
<br><b>houses were seperated and our side got part of the clawmarks, which
had a</b>
<br><b>mirror bolted over them, rather then tear it down, i guess.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; But I don't think he was Crazy, i think maybe he was
just trying to</b>
<br><b>become a doctor, or a vet maybe.&nbsp; Since he was a farmer he
probably couldn't</b>
<br><b>have aforded to go to school, so he made use of what he had.&nbsp;
I refer to the</b>
<br><b>ghost, as the farmer boy, and I think that he was just waiting for
someone</b>
<br><b>to come along who would understand him.&nbsp; Its been three years
since we moved</b>
<br><b>away, and seven years since I saw him.&nbsp; I learned that the
people who moved</b>
<br><b>in had taken the mirror down, and guess what was there.&nbsp; The
clawmarks.&nbsp; The</b>
<br><b>new owners tore the wall down and rebuilt it as well.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm fifteen now, and already I'm beginning to pick
up on other entities</b>
<br><b>in my surrounding area.&nbsp; We have a somewhat famous house whch
is known to be</b>
<br><b>hanted, just behind the cornfield which is behind my house.&nbsp;
We have a</b>
<br><b>church on my street as well that has some paranormal activity going
on.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>get constant visits from the tenant children, who died on the Battles'</b>
<br><b>Property (the haunted house), as well.</b>

<p><b>Forever Haunted</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: mac103@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I am not writing this account of my life as a form of validation
for what</b>
<br><b>has happened to me, I know these things happened. I am not writing
to assure</b>
<br><b>myself that I am not crazy for what I have seen, I know what I&nbsp;
have seen</b>
<br><b>over the years were actually there. I'm writing this because I have
come to</b>
<br><b>the point in my life where I believe it is time to share a bit of
myself, to</b>
<br><b>purge my mind of things of which I've always kept inside</b>
<br><b>I can remember things as far back to the age of 2 yrs old, I've
always been</b>
<br><b>one child accused of having a very vivid imagination..and many of
my</b>
<br><b>experiences were always chalked up to that by the adults surrounding
my life</b>
<br><b>when I was younger, I hold a Masters in Psycology, I am a liscensed</b>
<br><b>therapist, and I still believe there is more to life that what humanity</b>
<br><b>denotes there is.</b>
<br><b>>From the time I was&nbsp; a child, my parents lived in our own
home which they</b>
<br><b>built, it was a very large house, the upstairs held 4 bedrooms and
a study</b>
<br><b>and two bathrooms…it was constructed in the fashion of a long hallway
with</b>
<br><b>rooms on one side and the stairs to the lower level of the house
on the</b>
<br><b>other side, there was also a sewing nook right outside the master
bedroom,</b>
<br><b>which was on the opposite end of the hallway from where my room
was, the one</b>
<br><b>I shared with elder brother at the time.</b>
<br><b>Now, I have to point out, that at this time, we lived in the Caribbean,
the</b>
<br><b>reason I believe this is valid to the story, is because, in the
caribbean,</b>
<br><b>especially the island we lived on, many of the upper to upper middle
class</b>
<br><b>homes were built on plantation land, in many cases, the plantation
house</b>
<br><b>itself was still around and lived in, the thing is, I believe in
many cases,</b>
<br><b>one was never sure if one's home was actually built over some slave
cemetary</b>
<br><b>or in the spot where something traumatic might have happened in
the past.</b>
<br><b>Many times I would wake in the middle of the night and see shapes
and things</b>
<br><b>hovering and floating around my room. My brother slept in the top
bunk, and</b>
<br><b>because I had a tendancy to roll out of bed, I had the lower bunk.
One night</b>
<br><b>in particular, I woke up, and distinctly saw several pairs of eyes,
glowing</b>
<br><b>in the dark, floating around my room, I was terrified, and hid my
face deep</b>
<br><b>in my covers, extremely frozen in fear and hating the fact I slept
on the</b>
<br><b>bottom bunk.</b>
<br><b>Other times, I would wake, and because my family slept with our
bedroom</b>
<br><b>doors open due to the warm climate, I would glance down the dark
hallway to</b>
<br><b>my parents' room, and would&nbsp; view dark shadowy humanoid shapes,
darting</b>
<br><b>around in the hallway..never actually coming in my room, but for
some reason</b>
<br><b>I knew they knew I was awake and I saw them…and it was as if they
enjoyed</b>
<br><b>scaring me stiff in my bed, I would be terrified to go to the bathroom..many</b>
<br><b>times I wet my bed as a cause of these things.</b>
<br><b>Because of all of these things I saw, I would sometimes close my
eyes really</b>
<br><b>tight, and make a mad dash down the hallway right into my parents'
room and</b>
<br><b>jump right on their bed between them..I figured , if I kept my eyes
closed,</b>
<br><b>these spirit could not touch me, and I would never have to see them
up</b>
<br><b>close, amazingly, I always made it to my parents' bed without bumping
into</b>
<br><b>anything..seeing my eyes were closed the entire time I was running.</b>
<br><b>This went on for years, then when I was 9 yrs old, I woke again
one night,</b>
<br><b>and at this time I was sharing the room with my younger brother,
my elder</b>
<br><b>brother had moved into his own room, and my bed was&nbsp; placed
in such a way,</b>
<br><b>that I could see down the stairwell to the big wrought iron gate
that</b>
<br><b>separated the upstairs from the downstairs and was kept locked at</b>
<br><b>night.There ,holding on to the gate, peering up at me from the lower
level</b>
<br><b>of the house on the other side of the gate, was this skeletal figure,
to</b>
<br><b>this day, it is still extremely vivid,he was grinning up at me,
I recall him</b>
<br><b>wearing a top hat with a feather and he was trying to reach through
the bars</b>
<br><b>and beckon to me to open the gate. I&nbsp; felt my heart&nbsp; in
my through, that was</b>
<br><b>one of the most singular frightening experiences in my life and
I still can</b>
<br><b>see it clearly to this day. I remember running to my door and shutting
it,</b>
<br><b>all the while , keeping my eyes off the figure at the bottom of
the stairs.</b>
<br><b>Things tapered off for a while, until I was about 13, I woke again
in the</b>
<br><b>middle of the night to see this&nbsp; old lady with long hair float
by my bedroom</b>
<br><b>door and go into the bathroom..she never looked at me..but needless
to say,</b>
<br><b>I was startled out of my wits.</b>
<br><b>When I was 14, my Maternal grandmother died, I was very close to
her, and</b>
<br><b>when we flew over to her country for the funeral, I was asleep in
the parlor</b>
<br><b>of her home one night, when she came to me with my grandfather who
was</b>
<br><b>already dead&nbsp; and in her arms she held a baby, and she called
me by her pet</b>
<br><b>name for me and told me she was happy now, don’t cry. When I woke
, I told</b>
<br><b>my aunts and my mother, of course, there was some skepticism, until
I</b>
<br><b>mentioned the baby..apparently, my grandmother had a baby who died
at</b>
<br><b>childbirth..which only her children knew about, her grandchildren
were never</b>
<br><b>privy to this information.</b>
<br><b>I believe my grandmother is very happy right now..although, honestly,
I cant</b>
<br><b>be too certain she is happy I am writing this, because all of a
sudden there</b>
<br><b>are strong gusts of wind blowing through my room , granted they
are coming</b>
<br><b>from my bedroom window, but things were relatively still until I
mentioned</b>
<br><b>her and her baby.</b>
<br><b>I live in North America now, for a while, I lived in a major city,
with&nbsp; my</b>
<br><b>best friend, who is native american and another good friend, who
was from</b>
<br><b>Croatia. My best friend was once in training to be a shaman, thing
is, he</b>
<br><b>spooks easily , and had seen too many things during his training
to want to</b>
<br><b>continue in that vein, our other friend, claimed she was from a
long line of</b>
<br><b>witches and we would&nbsp; humour her..but never believed her, until
one boring</b>
<br><b>winter night, we decided to have a s&eacute;ance, my best friend
was very</b>
<br><b>apprehensive about this, but I wasn’t, I was very excited and so
was witch</b>
<br><b>woman.</b>
<br><b>We constructed our own ouija board on the floor, with the over turned
cup</b>
<br><b>and the circular pattern of letters and numbers, with yes and no
in the</b>
<br><b>middle.</b>
<br><b>As we got into things, R, (my best friend), would start to jump
all the</b>
<br><b>time, because he would see spirits,and S (witch wannabe) would actually
see</b>
<br><b>nothing, but would do the questioning..and she wasn’t too polite
about it</b>
<br><b>either, which pissed us off..the thing is, is that this is when
I realised I</b>
<br><b>was a channeler, a medium of sorts…I'd spoken with a few of my old
childhood</b>
<br><b>friends whom had passed on, and were validated by R because, without
ever</b>
<br><b>knowing about them, he would describe how they looked as the stood
by our</b>
<br><b>circle and spoke through me, suddenly my body was taken over by
this …thing,</b>
<br><b>all I could remember that I was crying and I could not control my
speech or</b>
<br><b>my body..something was talking through me and it felt slimy and
evil..and it</b>
<br><b>hated S with a passion. It told her, that if feared her mother's
next</b>
<br><b>child,which would be a boy and her mother was only 2 month pregnant…R
ran</b>
<br><b>out of the room and broke the circle, because he actually saw this
thing, it</b>
<br><b>was standing behind me, he described it as&nbsp; humanlike ,but
without the</b>
<br><b>benefit of skin and it was glaring at S over my shoulder.</b>
<br><b>After a while, from all I can actually remember, R cleared the circle
and</b>
<br><b>cleansed the apartment with sage and several other herbs in the
manner he</b>
<br><b>was trained to do, I remember it taking me a while to get over the
chills</b>
<br><b>and fear inside me, and it took us a while to get the thing out
of the</b>
<br><b>apartment.</b>
<br><b>Apparently, it was one of those demons controlled by S's long line
of&nbsp; witch</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; ancestors and saw our s&eacute;ance as an opportunity to
make itself known to</b>
<br><b>her..who knows..all I do know, is that her mother did have a baby
boy 7</b>
<br><b>months later.</b>
<br><b>Since then, I've gone out of my way to desensitize myself from the
spirit</b>
<br><b>world, I drink, I do drugs and&nbsp; basically pollute my body to
the border</b>
<br><b>point, where I am still in control, but I don’t have to see things
anymore,</b>
<br><b>I know this is a drastic way to deal with these things..and some
of you out</b>
<br><b>there would love to have this gift…I for one, don’t want it.</b>
<br><b>I still feel things though..I can tell what a person is all about
by just</b>
<br><b>looking at them, I also feel presences, I can walk into a home,
or room and</b>
<br><b>tell you if spirits abound..I can feel evil and I can feel good…and
worst of</b>
<br><b>all…I know that I am a catalyst for something spiritual and supernatural
and</b>
<br><b>I am scared to find out what my role will be, it's like I am hiding
from my</b>
<br><b>destiny……</b><b></b>

<br><b>My Crazy House</b><b></b>

<br><b>MANY STRANGE THINGS HAPPENED WHILE WE WERE THERE.&nbsp; THE ODD
THING IS, THE</b>
<br><b>STRANGE THINGS ONLY HAPPENED TO ME.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE FIRST EVENT I CAN REMEMBER OCCURED WITHIN
OUR FIRST WEEK IN THE</b>
<br><b>APARTMENT.&nbsp; I REMEMBER THIS DISTINCTLY BECAUSE SEARS DELIVERED
OUR FLOOR</b>
<br><b>MODEL TELEVISION ON THE DAY AFTER OUR FURNITURE CAME.&nbsp; MY MOTHER
WORKED THE</b>
<br><b>11-7 SHIFT AT THE PHONE COMPANY SO HER BABY SISTER WATCHED ME THAT
NIGHT.&nbsp; WE</b>
<br><b>ATE AND SHE BATHED ME BEFORE WE SETTLED DOWN TO WATCH T.V.&nbsp;
BEFORE LONG WE</b>
<br><b>WERE ASLEEP.&nbsp; I WAS AWAKENED IN THE WEE HOURS OF THE MORNING
BY MY BLADDER</b>
<br><b>AND SAT UP TO GO TO THE BATHROOM. NOW, MY AUNT AND I WERE LYING
ON THE FLOOR</b>
<br><b>IN FRONT OF A WINDOW THAT LOOKED OUT ONTO THE STREET.&nbsp; AS I
ATTEMPTED TO</b>
<br><b>STAND,&nbsp; SAW A SMALL FIGURE STANDING BY THE WINDOW WITH ITS
HANDS RESTING ON</b>
<br><b>THE RADIATOR THAT WAS DIRECTLY BELOW THE WINDOW.&nbsp; IT APPEARED
TO BE MALE, THE</b>
<br><b>SKIN WAS RUDDY AS IF IT WERE REGULARLY EXPOSED TO SUN AND WIND AND
IT WAS</b>
<br><b>DRESSED IN SOME SORT OF DARK CLOAK.&nbsp; THE CLOAK WAS HOODED AND
LOOKED LIKE THE</b>
<br><b>GARB OF A PERSON WHO WAS AROUND TO HAVE SEEN JESUS WALK.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I TRIED TO SCREAM AND I COULD FEEL THE PRESSURE
BUILDING UP IN MY HEAD, I</b>
<br><b>COULD FEEL THE TENSION IN MY JAWS BUT NO SOUND CAME FROM MY MOUTH.
I SHOOK MY</b>
<br><b>AUNT TO NO AVAIL. I EVENTUALLY STOPPED TRYING TO SCREAM AND LAID
BACK DOWN</b>
<br><b>WITH MY AUNT. I BURIED MY FACE IN HER CHEST AND WOULD PERIODICALLY
LOOK TO</b>
<br><b>SEE IF THE BEING WAS STILL THERE.&nbsp; IT ALWAYS WAS, JUST STARING
OUT OF THE</b>
<br><b>WINDOW. THIS WENT ON UNTIL IT BEGAN TO GET LIGHT. JUST AS I HEARD
MY MOTHER'S</b>
<br><b>FOOTSTEPS ON THE PORCH, THE BEING TURNED TO ME AND SMILED.&nbsp;
AS SHE PUSHED</b>
<br><b>OPEN THE DOOR IT DISAPPEARED.&nbsp; THIS EVENT AND THE OTHERS I
WILL LIST ALL</b>
<br><b>OCCURRED WHEN I WAS ABOUT 5 OR 6, I AM NOW 27. LOOKING BACK, IT
SEEMS AS IF</b>
<br><b>THE BEING WAS JUST WATCHING OVER ME UNTIL MY MOTHER GOT HOME. I
WAS MERELY</b>
<br><b>AFRAID OF IT'S PRESENCE, IT NEVER DID A THING TO HARM ME.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; THE NEXT THING HAPPENED IN THE SPRING OF THE
SAME YEAR. THE ROOM I</b>
<br><b>OCCUPIED WAS ON THE COMPLETE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THIS GROUND FLOOR
APARTMENT. I</b>
<br><b>NEVER LIKED TO SLEEP IN THERE BECAUSE IT WAS TOO FAR AWAY FROM MY

<br><b>SLEPT WITH HER NORMALLY.&nbsp; EXCEPT FOR THE TIMES MY FATHER WOULD
VISIT FROM</b>
<br><b>COLLEGE, THIS EVENT HAPPENED DURING ONE SUCH VISIT.&nbsp; WE HAD
ALL SPENT A DAY</b>
<br><b>OUT DOING WHAT I DONT REMEMBER, BUT WHEN IT CAME TIME TO GO TO BED
MY FATHER</b>
<br><b>SLEPT IN MY MOTHER'S ROOM.&nbsp; I REFUSED TO GO TO MY BEDROOM AND
SLEPT ON THE</b>
<br><b>COUCH IN THE LIVING ROOM.&nbsp; AFTER HAVING BEEN ASLEEP FOR A FEW
HOURS I</b>
<br><b>AWAKENED TO BEING CARRIED DOWN THE STEPS TO THE LAUNDRY ROOM.&nbsp;
I RUBBED MY</b>

<br><b>FINALLY SHE SNATCHED THE BLANKET OFF OF ME, THINKING I WAS PLAYING

<br><b>Street".&nbsp; It happened in Fall 1984 in an apartment in a large
apartment</b>
<br><b>complex located just outside of the back gate at Fort Benjamin Harrison,</b>
<br><b>Indiana.&nbsp; I moved there in September with my husband and 15
year old</b>
<br><b>son, as well as our completely unauthorized cat Eddie.&nbsp; Eddie
managed to</b>
<br><b>live there for four weeks before he was discovered and had to be
flown</b>
<br><b>back to my parents in Albuquerque, NM.&nbsp; This may have been
important</b>
<br><b>because nothing happened until he was gone.&nbsp; Our apartment
had 3</b>
<br><b>bedrooms, and was large and well designed.&nbsp; We loved it.&nbsp;
However, I</b>
<br><b>noticed that I felt uncomfortable in the hall outside the first
bedroom</b>
<br><b>which we used as a media room, that room was cold.&nbsp; So, I kept
the door</b>
<br><b>closed when it wasn't in use.&nbsp; However, I never mentioned my
feelings to</b>
<br><b>my husband or son.&nbsp; About one month after the cat departed,
I woke up</b>
<br><b>one night feeling my face pressing into the pillow, due to the bed</b>
<br><b>shaking.&nbsp; Having just moved from a three year tour in Japan,
land of</b>
<br><b>really good earthquakes, I thought it was an earthquake.&nbsp; However,
I</b>
<br><b>found that I couldn't move!&nbsp; I was sleeping on my stomach with
my head</b>
<br><b>turned to my left, and I couldn't lift my face out of the pillow.&nbsp;
At</b>
<br><b>this point I was really scared.&nbsp; I could slide my eyes to the
left, and</b>
<br><b>I managed to turn my face just enough that I could breath, but something</b>
<br><b>was pressing my head down, and holding my left arm down by the wrist.</b>
<br><b>By this time I was getting desperate.&nbsp; I slid my eyes up while</b>
<br><b>struggling to lift myself up and I saw two glowing red "eyes"?&nbsp;
At that</b>
<br><b>point I really began to put everything I had into the business of</b>
<br><b>breaking loose.&nbsp; Whatever it was just left.&nbsp; I was not,
and am not a</b>
<br><b>nervous person.&nbsp; This, however, was unsettling to say the least.&nbsp;
I was</b>
<br><b>36 years old and a Captain in the Army at the time.&nbsp; I was
not</b>
<br><b>particularly imaginative or impressionable. Aside from the inhospitable</b>
<br><b>media room, which stayed cold, there were no further incidents.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Horse Ghost Story</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Feather@horsecom.net</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp; Hi my name is sarah. I've been riding horses for several years
now and</b>
<br><b>i just thought i'd share this story with you about my first horse.</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>I got my first horse in 1993. i was about 7. It was a Small white
mare.</b>
<br><b>She was adorable. her name was Spirit. (what a coincidence...)&nbsp;
She was</b>
<br><b>about 10 when i got her. i rode her for a few years and we went
to horse</b>
<br><b>shows and beat everyone. we were a perfect pair. eventually the
enevitable</b>
<br><b>happens and i grew out of her. i got another horse. a Huge Black
mare Named</b>
<br><b>Raven. i still kept my little Spirit pony. last year she was diagnosed
with</b>
<br><b>Laminitis. which meant that she wouldnt' be able to be ridden any
more.</b>
<br><b>( i let my sisters ride her) it also meant that she wouldn't have
long to</b>
<br><b>live. She was also diagnosed with Equine Encephalitus. our whole
barn had</b>
<br><b>to go under quarantine for the disease is very spreadable and is
Fatal.</b>
<br><b>When Spirit was diagnosed, it was a terrible time. the State came
out to</b>
<br><b>our stable and said that we had to put her down. my dad dug a huge
hole</b>
<br><b>in the back of her pasture under her favorite tree ( we would go
out in</b>
<br><b>the summer and find her laying under this tree in the shade ). we
lead her</b>
<br><b>(limping) into the hole and i sat with her. the Vet injected her
with the</b>
<br><b>stuff to put her to sleep and her knees buckled. she fell down and
her head</b>
<br><b>landed in my lap. i began to cry. she looked me in the eye and her
eye closed</b>
<br><b>slowly. she died. i was heart broken. my first horse was dead. i
went to</b>
<br><b>school a few days later and i couldnt' concentrate on anything.
i couldnt'</b>
<br><b>do anything at all. I couldnt' do anything with Raven either. everytime</b>
<br><b>i looked at her i saw Spirit. it was horrible.&nbsp; WEll one day
i was standing</b>
<br><b>in my barn looking out towards the pasture where Spirit was burried.
for</b>
<br><b>some reason i felt a strong pull towards it. i walked to the fence
and peered</b>
<br><b>out. suddenly there was a loud Whinny. i looked down to the tree
where she</b>
<br><b>was burried and i saw Spirit STANDING next to the tree. She reared
up in</b>
<br><b>the air and took off running. She looked so free!! She was glowing...
there</b>
<br><b>was an auora around her. she was beatiful. she ran and ran and bucked
and</b>
<br><b>was having a wonderful time. by the time she got past me she whinnied
again.</b>
<br><b>there were tears running down my cheeks. she fanished after she
got past</b>
<br><b>the trees at the top of the field. she had come to say good bye.
i went</b>
<br><b>down to her grave the next day and i found a fresh hoof print next
to the</b>
<br><b>cross with her name on it. i was astounded. we didnt' have any other
horses</b>
<br><b>in that field. she must have left her mark. i was relieved. i knew
she was</b>
<br><b>in good hands and i knew she felt good. especially watching her
out in the</b>
<br><b>paddock.</b>

<br><b>Ghost Travelling.</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: martin.welsh@arcom.com.au</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hello!</b><b></b>
<p><b>My name is Martin and I live in Adelaide, South Australia. Last year,
two very close friends of mine went to London to live, and have just returned
briefly after a year. They told me tonight at a party that they have a
ghost in the house in London, where they live with two other Aussies. The
other couple have had no experiences with the ghost at all. My friends;
lets call them Frank and Alice; are affected very closely, especially Alice.</b>
<br><b>She's quite comfortable with the Ghost now, and calls him Kevin,
as she has no way of knowing his name. Kevin likes her, but doesn't like
Frank. He switches the light off when frank is in the shower, and stuff
like that. He sleeps in the bed, but Frank doesn't feel him there. Frank
is unsure what to believe, but he can see how Alice is about the whole
matter, and trusts her, but at first, really did believe it was her switching
the light off.</b>
<br><b>Anyway, Kevin doesn't do any harm, really. He seems to be kind.
He isn't noisy or destructive, but he does snore! Alice walked around the
bedroom one night trying to work out where the noise was coming from. Couldn't,
and went back to bed, to find it was right there in the bed! She says it
is actually a good feeling having him there. She includes him in her life,
talks to him etc, and just treats him in a natural way. I think it's cool.</b>
<br><b>The bit that freaked me, though, is that he's come back here to
Australia with her! I didn't know ghosts would do that. Alice's mother
has heard him in the house and she's scared. two weeks ago, she was a non
believer. She was at the same party tonight and I got to hear her story
too. I suppose she's mostly worried that kevin might stay when Frank and
Alice go back next week. I think it unlikely, as the connection seems to
be Alice.</b>
<br><b>I'm really interested in this.</b><b></b>

<br><b>First Experience</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: frozendragon@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Tonight I encountered the Pink Lady of Asheville, NC.&nbsp; I had
never heard of</b>
<br><b>the haunting of The Grove Park Inn until a friend and I were looking
down</b>
<br><b>toward the Palm Court Atrium floor from the lobby level three stories
up.</b>
<br><b>He told me the legend as he knew it.&nbsp; I assume that it is a
popular story</b>
<br><b>but if you need the details i can mail more.&nbsp; In effort to
try not waste too</b>
<br><b>much of your time, my expierience was this:</b>
<br><b>We rode the elevator to the atrium floor because I had heard running
water</b>
<br><b>and wanted to see the fountain hidden from view at the top.&nbsp;
We stood in</b>
<br><b>front of the fountain and I suddenly felt a cold pressure on the
back of my</b>
<br><b>neck that seemed to "get inside" and travel up through the back
of my head.</b>
<br><b>I nearly lost my balance.&nbsp; I had to go to the bathroom so we
went back to</b>
<br><b>the elevator and on the way up we stopped at both the floors that
were</b>
<br><b>inbetween the lobby and the "N" levels and just looked out the elevator</b>
<br><b>doors so not to miss anything.&nbsp; Level 7 had a display of gingerbread
houses,</b>
<br><b>level 8 was nothing special that I could see.&nbsp; We decided to
return to look</b>
<br><b>at the gingerbread houses on level 7, but when we went to the 7th
level it</b>
<br><b>was the empty room that I had seen on level eight.&nbsp; I figured
we could at</b>
<br><b>least look around.&nbsp; So we did and we went back up a set of
stairs from that</b>
<br><b>level to the lobby level.&nbsp; On our way back to the elevator
we saw a sign</b>
<br><b>about the gingerbread houses on level 7.&nbsp; I thought the sign
was misprinted</b>
<br><b>because we had just come from level "7" and it was the empty floor.&nbsp;
We rode</b>
<br><b>the elevator to level 8 and just as i said "wouldn't it be strange
if we</b>
<br><b>wound up on the empty level again?" the doors opened to that very
level.&nbsp; I</b>
<br><b>felt extremely compelled to explore the level some more but i needed
to see</b>
<br><b>level 7 again to ease my mind so we stayed in the elevator and finally
got</b>
<br><b>to the gingerbread display.&nbsp; She communicated with me one last
time as we</b>
<br><b>were leaving through the parking garage.&nbsp; We got in to another
elevator (at</b>
<br><b>the other end of the hotel) and I watched the level indicator.&nbsp;
There is not</b>
<br><b>a level 8 going to the garage, we only went one floor down, but
the only</b>
<br><b>number that ever showed on that indicator was a red number eight
and it came</b>
<br><b>on when were in between the floors. When i got home (after trying
to figure</b>
<br><b>out what the three eights could mean) my original theroy was proven
correct</b>
<br><b>by a web page on the ghost.&nbsp; Aparently the most activity comes
from two</b>
<br><b>floors above the atrium floor (level 8) in room 545.&nbsp; To my
knowledge no one</b>
<br><b>has tried to find out what it is about that room that's so important.&nbsp;
I</b>
<br><b>will be researching that at the library tomorrow to make sure, but
so far it</b>
<br><b>seems very little is known about this girl.</b>
<br><b>Here's my point.&nbsp; I have, in the past, been able to sense positive
and</b>
<br><b>negative energies in certain places.&nbsp; I have felt the presense
of my great</b>
<br><b>grandfather's ghost in our summer home.&nbsp; But my experience
with the pink</b>
<br><b>lady was far beyond positive or negative, I feel as though she was</b>
<br><b>specifically trying to guide me somewhere on that 8th level.&nbsp;
Possibly to</b>
<br><b>room 545.&nbsp; I cant explain the emmense empathetic feelings that
I recieved</b>
<br><b>while on that level and it's unnerving me because I feel responsible
to that</b>
<br><b>empathy somehow.&nbsp; My friend wants to return in a couple days
with his friend</b>
<br><b>who is apparently experienced in talking to spirits to try to see
and</b>
<br><b>communicate with her.&nbsp; I know that the form of communication
she was using</b>
<br><b>was because i have never seen a ghost, and I don't know why i know,
but she</b>
<br><b>seemed just as comfortable with that form as I am.&nbsp; Otherwise
she would have</b>
<br><b>appeared like she has in the past. I found your website and it was
the only</b>
<br><b>one i felt i might be able to learn from.&nbsp; If you have any
suggestions on</b>
<br><b>what I should do next please share them with me.&nbsp; I feel the
need to go back</b>
<br><b>but I don't want to make any mistakes.&nbsp; Thank you so much for
reading this,</b>
<br><b>I apologize that it is so lengthy.</b>
