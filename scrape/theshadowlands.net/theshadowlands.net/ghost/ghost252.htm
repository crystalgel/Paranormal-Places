<P><B>My Best Friends House</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: CalicoRose2112@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>My best friend Shari's house is a fairly new pre-fab house that sets
on a couple of acres of land in Fairview Idaho, just over the Utah Idaho
border. From the day she and her husband and then two children, she has
five now, moved into their house she knew that something or someone else
was in their house. Her husband has never experienced anything, not that
he will admit to, but she and her kids have!! Let me give you a layout
of the house. When you come in the front door you walk into a large living
room. Stairs that lead down to the partially finished basment are immediately
to your right. Straight a head of you is the kitchen and dining room. When
you walk into the kitchen, to your left is the laundry room and a bathroom
and the back door which goes out to the drive way. If you turn right in
the kitchen you have a hallway, another bathroom and two bedrooms. It is
in this hallway, bathroom and two bedrooms the most of the activity has
occured. When Shari first moved into the house she felt that something
or someone was in the back bedroom, next to hers and she kept the door
to that room shut, thinking whatever was in there would stay in there if
the door was shut. To this day they rarely use that room. The kids spend
little if any time in there preferring to play elsewhere in the house.
When you walk back into that room you feel very uncomfortable and you get
the feeling your being watched. One night her little boy who was in the
middle of potty training was in the bathroom, alone doing his thing. Shari
was in the kitchen and her husband was watching t.v. in the living room
when all of a sudden her little boy came running out of the bathroom faster
than she had ever seen him in run before with a look of pure terror on
his face. He didn't stop running until he reached the safety of his daddy's
lap. Shari went and looked in the bathroom to see what had scared him and
found nothing. She wishes she knew what he saw. One night Shari was woken
up by music coming from the other bedroom. When she got up to investigate
she found her sons toy car, which has to be pushed across the floor to
make it play its music and flash its lights, sitting on the shelf playing
music and flashing its lights. When she picked it up it stopped. All the
kids were sound asleep and she didn't know what to make of it. She and
her kids have all see the caps on the milk jugs suddenly pop off for no
reason at all. Mind you these caps screw on!! She and her children have
woken up in the night unable to move, filled with terror, barely able to
speak. Shari said she knew someone or something ws standing in her doorway
and the darkness in the door was darker than any darkness she had ever
seen. Only when she prayed for help did the darkness go and the paralysis
leave. She and her kids often smell cigarette smoke in the house even though
nobody smokes. Shari says she often hears someone walking up and down the
basement stairs and strongly senses that someone is there, even though
she has never seen anything. There is a spot in her kitchen near the sink
where she has felt cool breeze coming up from the floor and she says she
has felt it go right through her. One night when her daughters whose bedroom
is downstairs had a sleep over with a few of their friends they all woke
up and saw a girl standing in their room. She was wearing white and long
blonde hair that seemed to be blowing in the wind even though there was
no wind in the room. Then just a few weeks her other daughter woke up in
the middle of the night and saw someone standing next to her bed. Thinking
it was her younger sister, she hollered at her to go back to bed. When
the girl turned around she realized it wasn't her sister at all. It was
a young girl about ten years old, dressed in white with long brown hair
and brown eyes. The girl smiled at her and walked over to the book shelf
and started playing with the toys that were there until she dissapeared.
When Shari took some pictures of her little boy playing in a card board
box in her bedroom she caught some unusual things. Inexplicably the pictures
of her little boy are splashed with bright red and yellows and a vortex
can be seen in one of the pictures. The rest of the pictures taken in other
parts of the house came out just fine. Only the pictures in the hallway
and bedrooms had these unusual colors and vortexes. Shari doesn't know
the history of the house and doesn't think anybody has died in it. But
she and the kids have no doubt they are living in a house haunted by someone
or something that she would love to leave behind once and for all.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>My Dorm Experience</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: BlackShirtDfenz@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I was just sitting in my dorm room here at Kansas Wesleyan in Salina
Kasas.&nbsp; I was sitting at my desk talking to someone over the internet.
I had the window open becuse it was hot in the dorm room. There was a little
breeze coming through the window.&nbsp; All of the sudden I got this feeling
like there was something terribly wrong somewhere.&nbsp; it was really
quite all over the dorm.&nbsp; way quitier then usuall.&nbsp; it was almost
just still like there was no life at all.&nbsp; this went on for about
ten minutes when the breeze was still coming through the window but the
shades were not moving. I looked around the room becuase i knew something
was wrong.&nbsp; it looked as if i was looking through someone elses eyes.&nbsp;
the room did not seem the same.&nbsp; while all of this was happening i
was still talking over the internet.&nbsp; i felt like there was some kind
of disturbance in the room, some kind of something that i cannot describe.&nbsp;
I was typing away trying to describe what i was feeling to the person i
was talking too.&nbsp; when i felt the energy or disturbance move.&nbsp;
it was moving very slowly.&nbsp; i felt it move from the center of the
room to.....wait it is here again, it is right behind me again it feels
as if it has hold of my heart and it is leaning on my shoulder it is moving
away again but it is still here in the room my whole body is stiff, it
feels as if it is just standing behind me, im a very hot andsweting. the
feeling isnt as tense as it was the first time as if it i trying to tell
me it will not hurt me.&nbsp; it left again and my whole body relaxed.
the whole time it was standing behind me, i could not turn my head as if
it did not want me to see it but i felt a sense of it touching the top
of my head and wrapping its arms around me as if hugging me. i have never
felt anything like that before in my whole entire life, the feeling was
so intense but yet i could not turn to see who it was. this is my story.&nbsp;
i would like to look into this some more to see what is really happening
here in the dorms at Kansas Wesleyan Unviersity.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>My Evil Me</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: OOArtemis@yahoo.com</B>
<BR><B>Since I was a little girl, my sisters and I have had frightening
experiences with spirits.&nbsp; When I was 6, my family and I moved to
a fairly new house (only 8 years old at the time) in West Texas.&nbsp;
As far back as I can remember we had strange things going on in that house.&nbsp;
First off, at night if you were to go through the hallway to get to my
parents room, you would always hear what sounded like a TV.&nbsp; You could
hear voices and sometimes music.&nbsp; Most of the time, my parents TV
was off.&nbsp; If you left the room and stood in the hallway again the
sounds would be gone.&nbsp; Secondly, when I would try to go to sleep at
night I would always have that classic someone's-watching-me feeling.&nbsp;
I always blamed it on me being a young child.&nbsp; The house was a scary
place to be at night.&nbsp; Where ever you went someone was watching you.&nbsp;
Friends who have spent the night rarely stayed twice.&nbsp; The areas of
the house that scared everyone the worst were the hallway to my parents
room and my older sister's closet.&nbsp; The closet always had a feeling
of hate radiating from it.&nbsp; I tried to spend a night in there with
my scared sister and didn't last.&nbsp; I was sleeping on the floor with
my head next to the closet and that just wasn't a good feeling.&nbsp; I
went back to my room after she fell asleep.&nbsp; A couple years after
we moved in, my younger sister had a frightening experience.&nbsp; Her
and I shared a bedroom with our beds parallel to each other with a nightstand
in between us.&nbsp; We were about 3 feet apart.&nbsp; One night I woke
up to her screaming my name.&nbsp; I woke up and asked what was wrong.&nbsp;
She told me that, for no reason at all, she woke up and looked over at
my bed.&nbsp; Laying at the foot of my bed she saw a light blue, glowing
figure of a woman.&nbsp; Her eyes were gone and her mouth hung open.&nbsp;
My sister described her as looking dead.&nbsp; My sister also added that
she couldn't see me anywhere on the bed.&nbsp; So she started screaming
my name and closed her eyes.&nbsp; When she opened them I was awake asking
her what was wrong.&nbsp; She told me and I looked down at the foot of
my bed and my huge stuffed animal that I had there every night was sparking
like it had really bad static electricity.&nbsp; I took it off my bed and
threw it in my bathroom sink and ran water over it (being young I thought
it would help).&nbsp; Years later my family and I moved to southern Louisiana
and moved into a gated subdivision.&nbsp; One night my two sisters were
mad at me and left the house to go on a walk.&nbsp; I followed them without
them knowing.&nbsp; I followed them up to the front gate of the subdivision
and talked to them for a minute.&nbsp; They quickly left in a huff, being
that they were still angry with me.&nbsp; (for what I don't remember now)&nbsp;
I stayed by the gate for a couple of minutes afterwards and then decided
to run to the end of the main street and hide behind some bushes that faced
the gate.&nbsp; I waited for my sisters to walk by and when they did (unaware
where I was hiding) stopped remotely in front of the bushes.&nbsp; I heard
my younger sister say, "What is Jenny (me) doing sitting on top that stop
sign?"&nbsp; (the stop sign is located next to the gate).&nbsp; After that
they walked on.&nbsp; I was a bit confused and was about to chase after
them but then, through the leaves, I saw a shadow of someone running past
the bushes I was behind.&nbsp; I could also hear the sound of footsteps.&nbsp;
I stood up quickly to see who was there.&nbsp; No one was in sight.&nbsp;
After this I ran to my sisters and told them what I had seen.&nbsp; They
then told me that they saw me, or what looked liked me, sitting on top
of the stop sign.&nbsp; They said I had a very angry, disfiguring grin.&nbsp;
After we traded stories, we ran home quickly.&nbsp; Later, my younger sister
told me that the ghost she saw on my bed and the ghost she saw on the sign
both looked exactly like me.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>My Experience(s)</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Sean S. From MA</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>Hello, I've just got to say I really enjoy your site. I visit this
ghost section whenever I can and whenever theirs an update, I always read
what other experiences people have gone through. I actually have a few
of my own as well.</B>
<BR><B>Here's my First:</B>
<BR><B>When I was young and I lived at my grandma's house with my Grandma,
grandpa, Mom, and brother I was always scared of the basement. Whenever
I went down their I just didn't like it. If someone else ever went down
their with me then I was fine but, when I always went down their alone
I was scared as hell. Whenever I had to go back upstairs I always felt
as if someone was chasing me back up the stairs in which made ME run Quickly
up the stairs.</B>
<BR><B>Here's my Second:</B>
<BR><B>I have a Collection of Wrestling Figures that stand up on my dresser
and also on a Shelf next to it. One time I was just laying down watching
t.v in my room when suddenly, everything that was on my dresser and shelf
fell over! And not like Domino's falling everything fell at the exact same
time.</B>
<BR><B>Here's my Third:</B>
<BR><B>One nigh when it started to get really cold out I decided to take
my fan out of my window. I took it out and leaned it up against the wall
so that it wouldn't fall over. I then closed the two windows in my room.
All the windows in the house were closed but my room still seemed to be
freezing. So, later on that night I was Watching T.V in my room when suddenly
my Fan fell over as if it was pushed AWAY from the wall. Now that scared
the crap outta' me!</B><B></B>

<BR><B>MY EXPERIENCES</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: wozniack_@excite.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>It all began around the first of June, this very year.&nbsp; This
incident took</B>
<BR><B>place in my grandmother and grandfather's home.&nbsp; My grandfather
had been</B>
<BR><B>diagnosed with cancer.&nbsp; In the summer of 1998, I didn't know
that, that</B>
<BR><B>those last few months would be the last time I would ever see him
alive.</B>
<BR><B>During that period of time, I had spent a whole lot of time with
my</B>
<BR><B>grandparents.&nbsp; And, had felt like I had actually gotten a little
closer to</B>
<BR><B>them both, but particularly my grandfather.&nbsp; At the end of
the summer I</B>
<BR><B>left, and went back home.&nbsp; Subsequently, about five months
later our family</B>
<BR><B>received a disturbing phone call; it was from my grandmother, informing
us</B>
<BR><B>about the passing of our grandfather.&nbsp; He had passed away in
the hospital.</B>
<BR><B>We went back to our grandmothers' home (which was the very last
place that</B>
<BR><B>our grandfather lived in before his passing).&nbsp; A month, and
a half after we</B>
<BR><B>had been staying there I noticed that something did just not feel
right; the</B>
<BR><B>whole atmosphere had changed.&nbsp; I decided to take the guest
room.&nbsp; For some</B>
<BR><B>reason, I always got the feeling that I was being watched in the
guestroom.</B>
<BR><B>Then, other little occurences started to evolve... The very first
was, I</B>
<BR><B>always felt like somebody was standing over my shoulder.&nbsp; I
started to</B>
<BR><B>notice scars on my back after I would awake in the mornings, I would
feel</B>
<BR><B>lite touches on my back, my mom, and brother both complained about
the door</B>
<BR><B>handles being rattled and opening and closing really fast, cabinet
doors</B>
<BR><B>would fly open and the pots &amp; pans would all fall out, my hair
would get</B>
<BR><B>pulled in the night, diminutive objects would fall from mid air
(such as...</B>
<BR><B>paper, hair clips, and coins), and I would hear voices, one of which
said,</B>
<BR><B>"wake up!" very loudly in my ear, I would see mists and rays of
light shoot</B>
<BR><B>past me extremely fast... so fast, infact I could feel a woosh of
air, I</B>
<BR><B>would notice some of my belongings missing..&nbsp; such as..&nbsp;
my CDs, jewelry,</B>
<BR><B>money to name a few..&nbsp; usually belongings that I would use
a lot around the</B>
<BR><B>house, I would feel my bed move, as if someone were to bump into
it during</B>
<BR><B>the night, flickering lights, and last, but not least, since animals
can</B>
<BR><B>sometimes see things that humans can not see..&nbsp; my cat would
turn her head</B>
<BR><B>really fast, and just start at something (which I would not be able
to see)</B>
<BR><B>for a significant amount of time.&nbsp; A little while later...&nbsp;
about a month</B>
<BR><B>after being there...&nbsp; I saw the unthinkable.&nbsp; After I
had been sound asleep</B>
<BR><B>for about 7 hrs., or so.&nbsp; I woke up suddenly to a spirit at
the foot of my</B>
<BR><B>bed, and it was my grandfather!&nbsp; I could not believe what I
was seeing, but</B>
<BR><B>I will describe this to you in full detail...&nbsp; there was no
doubt in my mind</B>
<BR><B>that this was an actually spirit.&nbsp; He was shadowy like, but
his clothing was</B>
<BR><B>colored.&nbsp; He would always wave at me, and sure enough he was
waving in my</B>
<BR><B>direction with a smile on his face.&nbsp; It was plain to see that
he was trying</B>
<BR><B>to get my attention.&nbsp; He just wanted to see me.&nbsp; I was
too afraid to move a</B>
<BR><B>muscle, in fear that inspite of everything else that he would approach
me.</B>
<BR><B>I had never seen anything like this before in my entire life.&nbsp;
I didn't want</B>
<BR><B>to tell this to anyone though, I thought that nobody would believe
me, or</B>
<BR><B>listen.&nbsp; About a week later I was in the kitchen with my mom,
and she told</B>
<BR><B>me that the guestroom was where our grandpa had stayed in before
he died,</B>
<BR><B>because he was too ill.&nbsp; That explains the reason why THAT
very room felt</B>
<BR><B>like the most erie room in the house.&nbsp; I almost fainted whenever
I</B>
<BR><B>discovered that, but I knew that a spirit can travel anywhere in
the home,</B>
<BR><B>even outside or in back of the house!&nbsp; But, It wasn't until
a month later</B>
<BR><B>that I decided to come out with the news.&nbsp; I first confided
in my mom, and</B>
<BR><B>brother.&nbsp; And my mother believed me because she said that before
I brought</B>
<BR><B>up anything that I said that... our grandmother had experienced
the exact</B>
<BR><B>same thing!&nbsp; That he was at the foot of the bed watching over
her, and</B>
<BR><B>smiling.&nbsp; I had a phone conversation with her, and I let her
do all the</B>
<BR><B>talking first, and everything that she told me measured up with
my</B>
<BR><B>experience.&nbsp; And, it only happened to my grandmother, and I;
whom, he was</B>
<BR><B>the closest with before he passed away.&nbsp; Everyone was wondering
why I didn't</B>
<BR><B>scream, or attempt to run out of the guest room as soon as I saw
him, but I</B>
<BR><B>was too afraid.&nbsp; Whenever you're that close to something like
that..&nbsp; It</B>
<BR><B>just takes your breath away completely.&nbsp; I was in my own little
qualm.&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>felt very uncomfortable.&nbsp; It wasn't until I started sleeping
on the living</B>
<BR><B>room sofa that I felt appeased.&nbsp; Albeit, this has not been
my first</B>
<BR><B>experience.&nbsp; Ever since I was the age of five; my family and
I started</B>
<BR><B>traveling around a lot, and we would move here, and there... I've
went to 9</B>
<BR><B>different schools total.&nbsp; I'm now 17.&nbsp; In previous homes,
I've experienced a</B>
<BR><B>whole lot... I lived in a haunted house for a total of 3 years.&nbsp;
Not only by</B>
<BR><B>all of the experiences that I have endured, I have been doing many</B>
<BR><B>researches involving the paranormal.&nbsp; I'm really good at picking
up on</B>
<BR><B>things too, which I have found out.&nbsp; There was this one house
that we went</B>
<BR><B>into, that we were thinking about purchasing...&nbsp; but, I felt
like something</B>
<BR><B>was wrong.&nbsp; There were, several rooms in the home that I just
could not stop</B>
<BR><B>venturing off into..&nbsp; the main one's were the master bedroom,
and the study.</B>
<BR><B>After I left the house I told my parents that someone from that
house must</B>
<BR><B>have past away.&nbsp; Someone that used to stay in the master bedroom.&nbsp;
So, my</B>
<BR><B>mom went to go look up the history of the house, and sure enough...&nbsp;
the</B>
<BR><B>owner, and his wife on a trip to Calafornia got killed in a car
wreck; and</B>
<BR><B>they lived in the master bedroom, and the owner spent most of his
time in</B>
<BR><B>the study.&nbsp; After I was enlightened with that information...&nbsp;
I was in</B>
<BR><B>disbelief!&nbsp; I still am to this day too.&nbsp; My mom told me
that it goes back to</B>
<BR><B>her being Jewish/Indian...&nbsp; she said that she can pick up on,
and see things</B>
<BR><B>too.&nbsp; She claims that it's an Indian thing.&nbsp; But, I don't
know.&nbsp; Maybe it</B>
<BR><B>is!&nbsp; Anyways, God Bless everyone &amp; Thank You for your time...&nbsp;
Great web</B>
<BR><B>site by the way!&nbsp; I'm a current visitor!</B><B></B>

<P><B>MY EXPERIENCES</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Flychick845@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>Hello, I have alot of experiences to share. I have been told that
I am</B>
<BR><B>more "in-tune" with the spiritual world, and thats why alot of stuff</B>
<BR><B>happens to me. Anyways I'll just share some that I can remember.
One</B>
<BR><B>night,my friend Amanda was having a sleep-over with 3 other girls,
and</B>
<BR><B>someone brought along a ouija to play. We were playing,and having</B>
<BR><B>fun,because it was spooky. After that,we went to sleep at about
12, and</B>
<BR><B>we slept on a trundle that came out of the couch. We were the only
one's</B>
<BR><B>in the house,because her mom was out. Anyways, I woke up and shook</B>
<BR><B>everyone awake, becauseI had a "bad feeling",and I had heard the
closet</B>
<BR><B>doors slamming all night. It was pitch black,so I told for my friend
to turn</B>
<BR><B>on the light. She did,but it blew out. She tryed it again,but it
blew out once</B>
<BR><B>more. I thought bulbs can only blow out once. We were really scared,
and</B>
<BR><B>we saw this black mass approaching us, and closing in on us . We
jumped</B>
<BR><B>up,and all ran out of the house. We were really spooked,and didn't
go</B>
<BR><B>back inside for like 2hours.One time,when I was about 7 , I had
been</B>
<BR><B>staying at my grandparents house for easter vacation.I had got to
sleep in</B>
<BR><B>this one room, but for some reason,I didn't like it. Well one night,I
woke</B>
<BR><B>up,because I felt someone watching me. (There's a door that leads
to my</B>
<BR><B>room,and and right next to it is a door that leads to the backyard)
I sat up</B>
<BR><B>in bed, and right in front of the back door was this figure about
6 foot who</B>
<BR><B>appeared to have on armor,and held a walking stick. I was</B>
<BR><B>afraid,because I knew it was bad, but I wasn't able to run away,because</B>
<BR><B>the door to get out of the room was right next to where the spirit
was. I</B>
<BR><B>just looked at it,and it wouldn't let me go,finally after like 2
minutes it</B>
<BR><B>faded away,and I ran out of the room and refused to sleep in there
again.</B>
<BR><B>Another time, at my moms house, I was home alone, and I was watching</B>
<BR><B>tv in the living room. I heard the bath water running, and so I
ran to the</B>
<BR><B>bathroom to turn it off. I thought it must have been loose or something,so</B>
<BR><B>I tightened it. I closed the door,and resumed to watching tv again.
It</B>
<BR><B>somehow turned on again,so&nbsp; I tightned it again. This continued
on for</B>
<BR><B>another 4 times,and I still don't know what it was. In my dads house
an</B>
<BR><B>old lady supposivly died here before we moved in. I never sleep
with the</B>
<BR><B>light off,because I like to be able to see who and what is in my
room.</B>
<BR><B>Anyways I always get knocks on my door,even though its open,and
one</B>
<BR><B>night I felt like someone was sitting on my chest while I was sleeping.</B>
<BR><B>My older sister seems to get bugged more. Someone tickles her</B>
<BR><B>feet,pokes the bottom of her mattress while she's sleeping, and
breathes</B>
<BR><B>behind her when she's on the computer. In this same house, in my</B>
<BR><B>bedroom I hung this picture about 6in across,and 3in wide of this
rapper</B>
<BR><B>Dr.Dre on my wall. The next day, there was scratches that had torn
the</B>
<BR><B>picture,although it was still on the wall. This freaked me out,because
I</B>
<BR><B>was the only one visiting my dad that weekend,and he doesn't have
any</B>
<BR><B>pets. I put tape over it, just to cheaply laminate it,and see if
"she" could</B>
<BR><B>or would scratch it again. The morning after that,I was surprised
to find it</B>
<BR><B>scratched again. It freaked me out,but I left the picture there.
I don't</B>
<BR><B>think "she" likes rap very much, and I think "she" and "they" take
and</B>
<BR><B>hide things. These may not sound scary,but when they happen to you,it</B>
<BR><B>is. I have many more,but I can't remember anymore right now. Thanks</B>
<BR><B>for listening,and I'm sorry it was so long.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hello,</B>
<BR><B>a couple years ago i went to Kansas City MO with a friend and her
family. I got the basement bedroom with one of the brothers room down there
too.&nbsp; it was the night before i was leaving, and we all were up late
talking. i had seen the one sister "go" down stairs to the room, probably
b/c we were loud and to go to bed.&nbsp; a few minutes later i had to go
down stairs to get something and it was sooo dark, they had a switch almost
accross the room from where you enter, and as i walked in the room i heard
the light switch clicking and i said to mariah "here let me get it for

<P><B>Degree of ESP</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: anemone000@juno.com]</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>Hello! My name is Annie and I live in southern California, just outside</B>
<BR><B>Los Angeles. I've been reading over&nbsp; the stories posted here
and they</B>
<BR><B>sound a lot like my own story.</B>
<BR><B>First of all, my mom, oldest brother, and myself all have some degree
of</B>
<BR><B>ESP, which I think makes us sensitive to paranormal activity and
might</B>
<BR><B>even attract spirits to us.</B>
<BR><B>I'm sure my house has been haunted ever since I was a baby. And
here's</B>
<BR><B>what happened:&nbsp; in 1979, the year before I was born, my parents
and 2</B>
<BR><B>older brothers moved into a brand new house.&nbsp; My mom said the
2nd day in</B>
<BR><B>that house she knew weird things were going on.&nbsp; Footsteps,
voices, odd</B>
<BR><B>sounds, things like that.&nbsp; All she knew was that our house
and all the</B>
<BR><B>others on the street were built over farmland land.&nbsp; It seemed
that</B>
<BR><B>strange things would happen in our house for a few days and then
would</B>
<BR><B>stop, but then the neighbor would complain of odd things in her
house.</B>
<BR><B>It seemed like the ghost was going up and down the block to all
the</B>
<BR><B>houses.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was born in 1980, and ever since I can remember
I have</B>
<BR><B>noticed strange things myself.&nbsp; I would hear heavy footsteps
downstairs</B>
<BR><B>when everyone was asleep upstairs.&nbsp; Sometimes I would hear
chairs</B>
<BR><B>dragging across the floor, pots and pans banging, things like that.
One</B>
<BR><B>day when I was about 5 years old, I heard a woman's voice call my
name</B>
<BR><B>from the 2nd story window although my mom was making dinner in the</B>
<BR><B>downstairs kitchen.&nbsp; My 2 older brothers would constantly ask
my mom,</B>
<BR><B>"Who was that lady in the white nightgown that was walking in the
hallway</B>
<BR><B>last night?"&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometime later a child spirit came to our
house also.&nbsp; He</B>
<BR><B>liked to go running up the stairs in the middle of the night and</B>
<BR><B>generally cause mischief, like hiding things and moving objects
around.</B>
<BR><B>His footsteps sounded like a toddler scuffing around in a sleeper</B>
<BR><B>jumpsuit.</B>
<BR><B>My mom confronted the lady ghost one time, and all the ghost said
was "I</B>
<BR><B>love your baby."</B>
<BR><B>I only remember seeing the ghost only once, when I was 14, as a
dark</B>
<BR><B>shadowy figure moving down the staircase.&nbsp;&nbsp; My best friend
even witnessed</B>
<BR><B>the curtains in my room swinging back and forth rapidly when the
window</B>
<BR><B>and door were shut tight, and I was woken up one night with my bed</B>
<BR><B>shaking pretty hard.</B>
<BR><B>In 1999 we moved to another house across town, and either the ghost</B>
<BR><B>followed us or there's others spirits here anyways. The first night
here,</B>
<BR><B>I watched a book move itself from the middle of a table and fall
onto the</B>
<BR><B>floor.&nbsp;&nbsp; Every night in my new room, just after I shut
off the lights to</B>
<BR><B>go to bed, my bedroom door would open, I'd hear some footsteps on
the</B>
<BR><B>carpet, my guinea pigs would squeal, and then the entity would leave
my</B>
<BR><B>room and shut the door again. How polite. :) My mom has seen her
many</B>
<BR><B>times, she is an elderly lady named of Helen that often gazes out
the</B>
<BR><B>large window in the den. Some times I've felt cold spots in the
house,</B>
<BR><B>usually in the hallway by the bedrooms.&nbsp; My younger brother,
sister, and</B>
<BR><B>myself all feel like somebody is watching us if we stay up late
at night.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp; My sister says that sometimes the light fixture on the ceiling
in her</B>
<BR><B>room will swing back and forth by itself.&nbsp; Oh, and sometimes
my TV,</B>
<BR><B>stereo, and VCR will flip on and off when nobody is around.</B>
<BR><B>Here's another creepy event: I have a rabbit that lives in the den
and</B>
<BR><B>she begs for food whenever humans walk into the room. A few days
ago I</B>
<BR><B>was watching TV in the den, and the rabbit ran to the edge of the
carpet,</B>
<BR><B>turned around, and stood on her hind legs, begging for food at thin
air.</B>
<BR><B>She ran into the middle of the room and did the same thing again.</B>
<BR><B>Finally she ran to the other side of the room and begged some more,
and</B>
<BR><B>then she sat looking at that part of the room for a while, with
her ears</B>
<BR><B>turned forward in an alert manner. I've heard that dogs and cats
are</B>
<BR><B>sensitive to spirits, and I guess my rabbit is too. By the way,
I've had</B>
<BR><B>several dogs in my house that I've watched for neighbors and family
for a</B>
<BR><B>few days at a time, and each one has done that "stare at the empty
corner</B>
<BR><B>and bark" thing.</B>
<BR><B>Since my schedule is usually different than everyone else's here,
I often</B>
<BR><B>get home very late at night when everyone else is asleep.&nbsp;
There is</B>
<BR><B>always a light on in the front room of the house, and when I come
home I</B>
<BR><B>always see a dark outline or figure of Helen standing in the window,
as</B>
<BR><B>if our friendly spirit is waiting up for me.&nbsp; So when I walk
in the door</B>
<BR><B>I say, "I'm home, thanks for waiting for me" and then I get the
feeling</B>
<BR><B>around me that all is well.</B>
<BR><B>Sometimes our spirit plays pranks on us, such as hiding my makeup,
and</B>
<BR><B>I'll find my lipstick a week later perhaps under the sink or in
my mom's</B>
<BR><B>china hutch.&nbsp; Or a few times she come up behind me and tugged
on my</B>
<BR><B>ponytail, and when I turn around nobody is there.&nbsp;&nbsp; I
often feel</B>
<BR><B>something touching my hair too, it feels like the way a little girl
plays</B>
<BR><B>with her friend's hair.</B>
<BR><B>We also get other spirits passing through, such as the male ghost
dressed</B>
<BR><B>like a lumberjack that my mom saw only once in the backyard, or
another</B>
<BR><B>entity with heavy footsteps that whistles in the kitchen once in
a while.</B>
<BR><B>Right now I don't mind living with a friendly spirit or two. I think
it's</B>
<BR><B>kind of nice to know that somebody is waiting for me every night.&nbsp;
Helen</B>
<BR><B>has never caused us any problems besides the occasional uneasy</B>
<BR><B>being-watched feeling, a few pranks, a flowery perfume scent that's
in</B>
<BR><B>the house some days, and the usual disembodied voice calling from
another</B>
<BR><B>room. I've never felt threatened or senses evil. So she is welcome
to</B>
<BR><B>stay.</B>
<BR><B>If anyone else has a friendly spirit around, feel free to email
me.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Ghostly Experiences</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: akane2299@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've had a few "ghostly" experiences in my life
so</B>
<BR><B>far. Most are probably my overactive imagination, the</B>
<BR><B>incident I experience in Columbus,Ohio was as real as</B>
<BR><B>it can get!</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I went to college at Columbus College of
Art and</B>
<BR><B>Design in Columbus, Ohio. There were plenty of stories</B>
<BR><B>going around that the freshman dorms were haunted.</B>
<BR><B>CCAD is known as being a very fast-paced,</B>
<BR><B>highly-stressed school and that many of the "ghost"</B>
<BR><B>are past students who killed themselves because their</B>
<BR><B>already sensitive dispositions couldn't handle the</B>
<BR><B>pressure. I never really gave any credence to these</B>
<BR><B>stories until I experienced something that I still</B>
<BR><B>can't explain.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I lived on the third floor of the dorms and shared</B>
<BR><B>my room with 3 other girls. 2 girls slept on one side</B>
<BR><B>of the room and I shared my room with Rose on the</B>
<BR><B>other side. A kitchenette/dining area w/ the main door</B>
<BR><B>leading to the hall seperated the two.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One night I was sleeping and my roomate,Rose,
left</B>
<BR><B>to go visit her boyfriend in his room (it's co-ed</B>
<BR><B>dorms). I slept without incident until sometime around</B>
<BR><B>9:30pm. I awoke to the sound of someone entering our</B>
<BR><B>room through the main door, coming into the bedroom</B>
<BR><B>and riffiling through papers and things by Rose's side</B>
<BR><B>of the room. Thinking that Rose had come back to get</B>
<BR><B>something I said"Hi Rose, forget something?" But got</B>
<BR><B>no answer. The moving of papers continued and I called</B>
<BR><B>out another greeting to Rose and still got no</B>
<BR><B>response. Finally, I turned my head to look at her and</B>
<BR><B>ask her what her problem was (I thought she wasn't</B>
<BR><B>answering me on purpose) but no one was there. Plus,</B>
<BR><B>the shifting of papers stopped and everything fell off</B>
<BR><B>of Rose's desk and onto the floor. I got up and ran</B>
<BR><B>out into the commons area to ask anyone if they had</B>
<BR><B>seen someone come in or out of the room-no one had.</B>
<BR><B>Then I went down to Roses boyfriend's room and asked</B>
<BR><B>Rose if she had come upstairs. She swore to me that</B>
<BR><B>she had been in her man's room ever since she had left</B>
<BR><B>upstairs.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can't remember which room number
it was, but</B>
<BR><B>if you're on the 3rd floor facing the elevator-the</B>
<BR><B>room is the second room on your right-hand side. Once</B>
<BR><B>you're IN the room-It's the bedroom to your left.</B>
<BR><B>** Another quick incident-Not long after that, I was</B>
<BR><B>taking another nap by myself in the room. Just as I</B>
<BR><B>was falling asleep someone pushed me out of bed. Most</B>
<BR><B>people that I told about this just said I fell out of</B>
<BR><B>bed. But I swear that I felt someone push me on my</B>
<BR><B>back and I hit the floor a decent distance away from</B>
<BR><B>the side of my bed**</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since then, It's been 5 years since I lived in</B>
<BR><B>those dorms and have not had any paranorml incidence</B>
<BR><B>since.</B>

<BR><B>My Ghost Story</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: jhenwa@yahoo.com</B>
<BR><B>I had quite an experience with a ghost (or a pair of</B>
<BR><B>ghosts) just last night!! It was about 9:30, I was</B>
<BR><B>settling into bed.&nbsp; As I started to drift into a state</B>
<BR><B>of subconsciousness, I began to hear a woman hum a</B>
<BR><B>song. I found this odd since both my parents had</B>
<BR><B>fallen asleep prior to my adjourn to my bedroom.&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>then heard a child repeat the word "boy" from just</B>
<BR><B>outside the first window across from my bed.&nbsp; I turned</B>
<BR><B>on my ceiling light, too scared to turn it off again.</B>
<BR><B>I even fell asleep with it on.&nbsp; It scared me to death!</B>

<P><B>Almost a half year ago I experienced my first paranormal experience.</B>
<BR><B>It was the most coolest moment, but a little scary ,of my entire
life.</B>
<BR><B>My brother and I were were fighting in the livingroom, after a while
I</B>
<BR><B>ran to my room and rested for 2 minutes my brother ran into my room
roaring. We started laughing&nbsp; for&nbsp; about&nbsp; 30 seconds. And&nbsp;
then i picked up my hands and said ooooooo IIIIIImmmm&nbsp; scarded&nbsp;
and sudenly&nbsp; a big picture frame&nbsp; that was laying on a closet
behind my brother started shaking&nbsp; violently for about 3 seconds before
it jumped of the shelf. My brother was lucky enough to have reacted fast
enough and slid to my right and cought the picture . The closet is about
6 feet long and 3 feet wideand 6 feet tall. Since then similar events have
taken place and still occur to this day. That occurence did not change
me much because I always was into and believed in the paranormal and parapsychology
and I want to be a paranormalist.</B>

<BR><B>My Grandfather</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: pakers1@triad.rr.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>My encounter is with my grandfather who died in 1981. Last year when
my grandmother layed dying at her home I was standing at the foot of her
bed. being a nurse for 10 years I have been with many patients when they
take their last breath and I have never had anything like tis happen before.
While we were standing there my mom and dad brothers and sisters with aunts
uncles and cousins there also I felt the hairs on my neck and arms start
to rais up only when I was standing at a certian spot at the foot of my
grandmothers bed. I looked at my mother and asked her if she could feel
that she also told me yes. Now let me explain something My Grandmother
loved my grandfather very much. he was her whole world and when he died
we all thought that she would grieve herself to death but she didn't. The
only thing I can come up with to explain this happening is that my grandmothers
bed was sitting in the exact same spot as my grandfathers bed was when
he died and that he had come back to make sure that my Grandmother didn't
have to make the crossing alone.</B>

<P><B>My House is by the Cemetery</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: drutjens@lincbolt.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>When I was about 13 years old I had a friend spend the night at my
house. My room, which was in the basement, has swinging doors with about
1 &frac12; - 2 ft clearance on both the top and the bottom. We were lying
in bed, still awake at 2 am and heard footsteps coming down the stairs.
Then the living room light came on. We both got out of bed and looked under
the door to see if it was my mom coming to tell us to be quiet. You can
see the only light switch that turns that light on from where we were;
my mom wasn’t there. So I said "Mom" and the light went off. Neither of
us saw anything turn it off. We turned the light on in my bedroom and crawled
back into bed, terrified. We were laying there wide eyed when a stuffed
animal I had hanging from a hook on my ceiling started spinning in circles,
it started slow and then got extremely fast. Frightened we put our heads
under the cover and started singing "Jesus Loves Me". When we got enough
courage back to look back from under the covers the stuffed animal had
stopped spinning. I always had a feeling of a presence before this and
this just kind of justified it. Did I mention that my house was built 100
feet from a cemetery?</B>

<P><B>My House is Haunted</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: ShadowChaser46@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>In 1992 we moved from our home in St. Louis Missouri to a small
town in indiana.&nbsp; We rented a home for 31/2 years.&nbsp; We finally
had enough money to purchase a home of our own.&nbsp; We looked and looked
going to all the open houses and checking the real estate books when ever
they came out.&nbsp; Well we finally found the home of our dreams.&nbsp;
A very large two story home shaped like a barn .&nbsp; We seen this home
and knew it was the one we wanted.&nbsp; We came back several times just
to look at it from the outside it was ours Im sure of it I told my husband.&nbsp;
Well we did buy it and moved in the first night I was woke by the door
bell at about 3am&nbsp; I jokeingly said I&nbsp; think this place is haunted.&nbsp;
Little did I know this was not a joke.&nbsp; Three years fter we moved
here I seen a child that I thought was my daughter, I followed her to the
baasement to be meet with nobody around.&nbsp; This child was solid I could
not see her face but her clothes where very distinct.&nbsp; long sleeve
blue shirt and baggy pants like the kids where wearing .&nbsp; It was after
this that I started looking into the background of the house I was in awe
that the house had such a colorfull history.&nbsp; I serched the records
and found that the home was built on the property of the Bowens was that
a coincidence.&nbsp; Our last name was the same.&nbsp; I started hearing
children running on the front porch, and knocking on the doors in the middle
of the night I would always find no one in the area.&nbsp; I would awaken
to loud running like several children were playing downstairs but evrytime
I got up they would be gone.&nbsp; My husband thought I was going crazy
he said I watched to many movies.&nbsp; I tried to let it go and ignor
it but I would always come up with a new question.&nbsp; I finally thought
I would like to know who was here.&nbsp; I ask if they would leave me a
sign that everyone would see and that is when it started to get crazy.&nbsp;
I got up the next morning to find a very small hand print in the cat litter
box.&nbsp; The hand print was about the size of a two or three year old
my children were much bigger and they would never stick there hands in
a cat litter box.&nbsp; I realized at this point that the house was occupied
by more than one spirit.&nbsp; The hand print was to small to belong to
the child I had seeen.&nbsp; I began to here whispers and see things out
of the corner of my eye when I was alone.&nbsp; I could since that someone
was watching me.&nbsp; Then one day I took a picture of my daughter by
the xmas tree this is when they decided to make there presence known.&nbsp;
The picture had two dogs and a man in it the only one in the house at the
time was me and my daughter I was shocked to find the man and dogs as I
had been hearing a dog bark around the house and blew it off as a neighbors
dog although I had never seen the dogs.&nbsp; I started asking about the
house in the neighbor hood and was told everyone knew the place was haunted
that it had been haunted since the house was built.&nbsp; I callled the
man whoes father and grandfather had built the house and he was shocked
he came to my house and showed me pictures of the old house that stood
where mine now stood an old shack like in the little house on the prairie
,&nbsp; They built this house and from the begining they had heard strange
noises and children the children said that the chair would move by itself
and they would hear there names being called but nobody was there.&nbsp;
I had an idea that the original owneres never left so I looked up the cementary
records and I found some of the names of our ghost.&nbsp; I had a close
encounter with a young blonde woman in my pantry.&nbsp; I was puting my
grocerys up when I stuck my arm through her it felt as if I was charged
with electricity.&nbsp; I turned to look right at a beautifull girl with
bright blue eyes but she was transparent.&nbsp; I was scared I dont mind
tellling you but I have to live here and I was not going to let her scare
me off.&nbsp; I could hear her telling me her name waas Sarah with a H.&nbsp;
I went to the cementary and low and behold I found her grave she was 17,&nbsp;
I also found the grave of Silas Mitchell he was a civil war soldier. He
was the one in my picture.&nbsp; I have since seen about 6 spirits I somehow
think they are here to watch over us.&nbsp; We had a house fire and it
was 3 am my son was woke by a woman telling him to get out the house was
on fire.&nbsp; The smoke detectors haden't yet gone off.&nbsp; We got out
and saved ourselves but lost our dog, and our bird&nbsp; I thilnk they
are still here if the family is still here they must be too.&nbsp; Well
I hqave more stories but will have to get to them at another time .</B><B></B>

<BR><B>My Paranormal Activity... The Dark Men, and The Indians</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: DuGiNPiMp101@aol.com</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>Oh God, where do I start.&nbsp; I have always been afraid of the
paranormal.&nbsp; I always believed that me seeing or experiencing the
other side would be the end of me.&nbsp; I can now say that it has only
made me stronger, and braver.&nbsp; All my life, I have lived with Jesus
in my heart, being a Born-Again Christian.&nbsp; Whenever i felt alone,
or "not alone" i would say a prayer and feel alright.&nbsp; I have a few
stories with ghosts, or lets just say the paranormal. Keep in mind that
I am 16 years old...</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;One year ago, there was a spot in my town where a bunch of
woods and a giant field was cleared out, and made many wealthy homes.&nbsp;
It was in a historical area, where there is alot of Native American memorabilia
and such.&nbsp; Anyway, One of my friends had just moved into one of the
homes, and he had a few of us sleep over.&nbsp; So we were in his [finished]
basement playing with a Oija board and listening to the radio.&nbsp; It
was pretty corney, and nothing happened. So we put it away.&nbsp; We got
all freaked out, even though we were all sports jocks, and threw it in
a little patch of woods he had in his backyard. So we went back in his
house, just haning out, wiht our sleeping bags all set up on the floor.&nbsp;
We finally shut the radio off, it now being about 11pm.&nbsp; It was late
enough to do some damge, so we got eggs, and toilet paper, and went into
the new neighborhood and wrecked the houses and cars.&nbsp; We got back
at about 12:30am, and decided to go to bed.&nbsp; We turned out the lights,
(the radio was already off) and went to sleep.The radio turned on, playing
the station that we were listening to previously.&nbsp; It then changed
to someone singing, "Ring around the rosey, pockets full of Poseys" We
got so freaked out, because it was definetly NOT the radio.&nbsp; It sounded
like a little girl.&nbsp; Then the radio shut off, and we heard a nasty
sound, it sounded like a&nbsp; distorted, whirring and humming noise.&nbsp;
The radio started blasting, adn the lights began turning on and off, flashing
really quickly.&nbsp; We were so scared, not one of us moved, or said a
word.&nbsp; When the lights were flashing,&nbsp; I saw in the corner of
my eye a tall dark colored man.&nbsp; There was no shadow when the lights
turned on, and he almost looked transparent.&nbsp; I know this because
after I saw it in the corner of my eye, i looked striaght at it, but the
next time the light went out, then back on, it moved to a different part
of the room.&nbsp; It looked like an indian, but at that time, I was not
sure.</B>
<BR><B>The next morning, after NO sleep, we found ourselves in the living
room on the main floor.&nbsp; We told my friends parents all about it,
and they said they haddn't heard a think.&nbsp; When we went outside, not
a single drop of egg or toilet paper was on any of the surrounding houses
, except for my friends.&nbsp; I am NOT LYING. THIS IS 100%TRUE that it
was on the local news.&nbsp; My friends parents had the Warrens' look at
his house. (The Warrens are famous ghost hunters who live in Connecticut.)&nbsp;
They came to the conclusion that the house was indeed haunted, and that
it was built over an ancient Indian burial ground.&nbsp; We went to the
library, and checked the records, and that was true.&nbsp; I never slept
over his house again.&nbsp; Two other houses, on either side of his, reported
hauntings and strange things as well.</B>
<BR><B>Another time, I was at my friends house, and was running down her
hallway in her basement.&nbsp; I was stopped dead in my tracks by some
force.&nbsp; I stopped so suddenly, when i was running so fast, that my
body jerked itself backwards.&nbsp; About three inches infront of my eyes,
i say this white smokey thing fluttering up and down in one movment.&nbsp;
It is so hard to put in words, and the feeling I got was very peaceful.</B>
<BR><B>Another experience of mine, was at my cousins house in Waterbury
(Connecticut)&nbsp; She lives on a private drive that consists of only
five houses including hers.&nbsp; When i slept over, I always had a bad
feeling. I have seen dark men walking down into her basement, and seen
white people going the opposite way. Her remote control was missing for
about three weeks, they searched high and low, everywhere for it.&nbsp;
Couldn't find it ANYWHERE.&nbsp; one day my uncle was taking a nap on the
couch, and when he closed his eyes, he heard something drop on the kitchen
table... he opened his eyes, and the remote was tehre.&nbsp; He was the
only one in the house at the time.</B>
<BR><B>One thing that I understand, is NOT to mess with the paranormal,
many people say taht they cannot hurt you, but I do not believe that to
be true.&nbsp; Not all of ghosts are angels, VERY many of them are demonic.
My word of advice is to pray to God whenever you feel unconfortable in
a room, or when u get a bad vibe.&nbsp; Dont mess with anything unless
you know what you are doing.&nbsp; and dont EVER play with a Oija board.
Thats a definately NO.No!</B><B></B>

<BR><B>My Personal Experiences</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: wendyk90@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hello, I would like to share with you some incidents that has happened
to</B>
<BR><B>me.In November of 2000 my family and I purchased a wonderful old
house that</B>
<BR><B>was built back in the 1860's, well anyway my first thought of the
house was</B>
<BR><B>that it is haunted and now that I have lived there almost a year
now I think</B>
<BR><B>that my thoughts have been confirmed.Incident number 1:A friend
and I were</B>
<BR><B>up late one night sitting in the bedroom off the living room and
we had the</B>
<BR><B>door open so that we could see directly into the living room and
my 2 year</B>
<BR><B>olds Rock &amp; Roll Elmo Doll started going nutts repeating over
and over</B>
<BR><B>again, " ELMO ELMO" and after a few minutes of that it finally started</B>
<BR><B>singing the tune it was suppose to play.Keep in mind that her and
I were the</B>
<BR><B>only people there and we seen nothing by the doll that would cause
it to do</B>
<BR><B>that and the batteries were brand new.Incident #2 While my family
and I were</B>
<BR><B>sitting in the living room watching tv one night I heard some strange
music</B>
<BR><B>comming from the fire place room and when I got up to investigate
the music</B>
<BR><B>was comming from my locked curio box,it was my daughters wind up
music box</B>
<BR><B>playing and it played the entire song.Keep in mind that this music
box has</B>
<BR><B>been locked in this curio cabinet for about 5 years we did not even
take it</B>
<BR><B>out when we moved.Incident number 3:I was in the bathroom one evening</B>
<BR><B>picking up and looked over just on time to see the whole roll of
toilet</B>
<BR><B>paper fly off the spindle and it has happened more times since then.Incident</B>
<BR><B>number 4: I got up late one night to get a bottle for my new born
baby and</B>
<BR><B>alls that we had on that night was a night light just bright enough
so that</B>
<BR><B>you could see around the kitchen,anyway I get all done making her
bottle and</B>
<BR><B>start back to go up stairs and look over my shoulder to see the
reflection</B>
<BR><B>of a man sitting at my kitchen table in my glass sliding doors.Needless
to</B>
<BR><B>say I ran up the stairs and was scared out of my gord!My last story
is the</B>
<BR><B>one that kind of spooks me the most, I was about 8 months pregnant
with my</B>
<BR><B>last child when we moved in the house and I had her name picked
out "</B>
<BR><B>Pierson Michelle" was gonna be her name and then one night just
out of the</B>
<BR><B>blue I decided to name her "Pierson Amelia" my husband asked me
why I had</B>
<BR><B>made such a sudden change and had no good explanation to give him
for it I</B>
<BR><B>just said I don't know I guess it just sounds good.Well about a
month after</B>
<BR><B>she was born my mom called me up to tell me that she had done some
history</B>
<BR><B>researching on the house and to all of our amazement the very original
owner</B>
<BR><B>of the home was named " Amelia Poole".I to this day do not know
if it was</B>
<BR><B>just a qouincidence or maybe she had something to do with it.Well
i could go</B>
<BR><B>on even longer about my experiences but these were some of the one's
that</B>
<BR><B>stick in my mind.Thankyou for taking time to read them.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>My Personal Ghost</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Chicy69@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>I live in Woodstock IL with my mother step-father and three older
step-brothers.Right now I am 15 years old. When I was about 5 or 6. We
moved into our new home and got settled in.Now I know for being so young
I shouldnt remember stuff but in this instance I did. I lived in the house
till I was about 8 or 9 years old and to this day every time I pass it
I get a very uneasy feeling. The storie as I heard it from my older brother
is that our house was built by a preacher. He had it built for his wife.But
according to the story the preacher's wife left him for another man. The
preacher stopped going to his church and stopped just plain out living.
He ended up dieing in that house all alone. He always wanted kids though.
But to me there seems to be something else. Let me elaborate. Any married
couple that lived in that house (including my step-dad and his ex-wife)
always seperated. The pressence of the preacher was always there. He was
also very kind to children. At one point I was running up our stairs with
our dog a pit named Serena and she knocked me down. I almost fell but felt
myself being "caught" and pushed the other way so I fell onto the stairs
and able to catch myself. I used to try and tell myself how lucky I was
to have caught my balance. That fall could have killed me. I now know that
it isnt my luck at all it was a nice man who helped me live. But there
was something else. Something dark in that house. Everyone who lives there
feels it. Fights used to break out between memebers of my family for no
apparent reason. We could be all perfectly happy at one point then suddenly
on a whim we all felt angry and pissed off. It was a curse on the house
I think. I pass by that house on my way home from school now. Still I shudder
and have to turn away. There are two boards on the front of the house.
We put them up to fix the house. Those boards have been the same color
since we put them up no matter how much you paint them. No matter how much
we tried to fix something it refused. It would fix for about a day then
break or get trashed just a quick. While I remember the nice preacher who
once saved my life and many occasions I am sure watched over me I will
never forget the deep dark pressence that would scare the hell out of me
whenever I was alone.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>I Can Never Forget This</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: tarastar_21@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>This happened when&nbsp; I was about 10 years old or so but to this
day I can never forget it. It was summer-time (And summer's in India are
so hot) my cousins had come to spend the holidays with me. I was wearing
a short top with a pair of shorts and I was still feeling incredibly warm.</B>
<BR><B>Since my bedroom was not big enough for all my cousins (9 OF US)
we spread mattresses in the living room next to the kitchen ,and slept
there.</B>
<BR><B>I could not get to sleep at all even though I usually am not a late
sleeper. My parents had also decided to call it a night&nbsp; and were
in their room. There was absolute silence in the house. Suddenly almost
out of nowhere on that hot night, A&nbsp; ice cold jet of air rushed past
me making me throw my blankets on, but within seconds it was gone.</B>
<BR><B>I forgot about it and went back to trying to go to sleep but I was
disturbed by sounds from the kitchen.</B>
<BR><B>They were the most odd sounds to hear at night. The clatter of vessels
and pouring of water or juice. It sounded almost as if someone&nbsp; was
cooking a meal right in our kitchen.</B>
<BR><B>It then occurred to me that if a meal was being cooked,then who
was cooking it ??? I could not understand this and since I was afraid to
go in the kitchen, I called out to my mother.</B>
<BR><B>The reaction to this was amazing. I heard the sound of vessels being
dropped and the cold jet of air passed by once again. Within seconds it
was gone.</B>
<BR><B>I could not sleep that night an for many nights after that though
I never heard anything after that night.</B>
<BR><B>To this day, I have not told anyone about it and have never clearly
explained it to myself .</B>

<P><B>Playing Next Door</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:bob_dunham@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>When I was younger we always used to play next door to my parents
house.</B>
<BR><B>The neighboors never cared cause I used to play with their son.&nbsp;
Their home</B>
<BR><B>used to be a funeral parlor, and their barn was used to store and
make</B>
<BR><B>caskets back in the early 1900's.&nbsp; There were still some caskets
up in the</B>
<BR><B>barn where we used to play.&nbsp; To make a long story short, a
bunch of us were</B>
<BR><B>playing up there one night, and we thought we heard a noise.&nbsp;
It was no big</B>
<BR><B>deal, but cause we were kidds, once one of us started to run, we
would all</B>
<BR><B>panic, and run really fast.&nbsp; So, I was the first down the long
narrow</B>
<BR><B>stairs, this barn was big, and shaped somwhat like a regular building.&nbsp;
So</B>
<BR><B>we all darted towards the stairs, and one of the guys was moving
faster than</B>
<BR><B>the kiddin front, and ended up pushing him down the stairs right
behind me.</B>
<BR><B>Then they just ran over him. We all got out if there, but we were
too scared</B>
<BR><B>to go back for him.&nbsp; We went inside, and then when he didnt
join us 5 minuts</B>
<BR><B>later, we went back.&nbsp; He wasnt moving, they called an ambulance
but he died</B>
<BR><B>with a broken neck.&nbsp; We were in shock, it seemed so harmless,
but he was</B>
<BR><B>really dead.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; I never went back there for months.&nbsp; But one night
the light in the barn</B>
<BR><B>was on.&nbsp; Ok, I thought, no big deal.&nbsp; But my dad thought
I had been playing</B>
<BR><B>over there, so he said I had to go and turn it off.&nbsp; It can
only be turned</B>
<BR><B>off upstairs, so once I turn it off, Im stuck in the dark.&nbsp;
I pleaded that I</B>
<BR><B>hadnt turned on the light, be he didnt believe me!</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp; So, I reluctantly went over there, all the while I
felt the barn could</B>
<BR><B>see me coming, its hard to explain.&nbsp; I hadnt been back ther
since the</B>
<BR><B>incident.&nbsp; I approached the stairs, there was still a blood
stain!&nbsp; I</B>
<BR><B>couldnt belive this.&nbsp; It was so weird, I felt like I had to
appologize to my</B>
<BR><B>friend for leaving him there that night.&nbsp; I went up the stairs
slowly, there</B>
<BR><B>was just one light bulb, but there were shadows moving on the walls.&nbsp;
All</B>
<BR><B>the caskets were propped up against the walls, for some reason this
scared</B>
<BR><B>me.&nbsp; So I turned off the light, and just then a casket fell
in front of me,</B>
<BR><B>but I couldnt see for sure.&nbsp; I barely knew where the stairs
were, and I</B>
<BR><B>tripped as I approached the steps.&nbsp; As I slowly made my way
down, I heard a</B>
<BR><B>creaping noise, and then a voice "Dont fall" it said, as if to hope
that I</B>
<BR><B>did!! I was freaked but couldnt run cause it was too dark to find
my way.</B>
<BR><B>But I made it out, obviously scared as heck.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then......the
next night, the</B>
<BR><B>light was on again!&nbsp; Once again, I was forced to go back, needless
to say</B>
<BR><B>many crazy things occured from this moment on.&nbsp; Fortunatly
this time I found</B>
<BR><B>the old circut breaker and cut the power to the barn from down below......</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Dustin</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: hilljack199@msn.com.</B><B></B>

<P><B>I have been reading some experiences from other people and it inspired
me to</B>
<BR><B>tell a little story of my own...</B>
<BR><B>I was about 17 at the time that my friend brought a Oujia board
to my house.</B>
<BR><B>A group of us girls sat around it and preceded to "raise the dead"
....little</B>
<BR><B>did we know that we were messing with a seriously messed up spirit.
He calls</B>
<BR><B>himself Dustin and took over my body. I don't remember much about
it but my</B>
<BR><B>friend's say that when I blacked out I began to holler about blood
and</B>
<BR><B>sirens...bright lights, rain and a women. I came back too and looked
around</B>
<BR><B>and saw an expression of disbelief on my friend's faces. My face
was soaked</B>
<BR><B>with tears.</B>
<BR><B>That is what started my...episodes...if you will. A year after that,
I was</B>
<BR><B>sitting at a my friend Will's house when he pulled out a Oujia board....I
had</B>
<BR><B>vowed to myself that I would never EVER touch one again...but I
did!!! About</B>
<BR><B>half an hour into our little session...Dustin popped up. This was
really</B>
<BR><B>strange since I hadn't really thought about him for quite a bit
of time. The</B>
<BR><B>ironic thing was I had only known Will for about a month...I had
never told</B>
<BR><B>him about Dustin.</B>
<BR><B>Dustin was evil. He would put pressure on my shoulder's sometimes...he
made</B>
<BR><B>it unable for me to walk...I would end up crouched over in a chair
until he</B>
<BR><B>left. One time he took over my car...the car started to speed up,
the radio</B>
<BR><B>began to blare and switch stations...the windshield wipers started.</B>
<BR><B>This was when I had enough. I decided to go to a church and be prayed
over</B>
<BR><B>because my prayers were never strong enough. When I entered the
church I</B>
<BR><B>began having trouble walking. When I entered the Sanctuary...I passed
out....</B>
<BR><B>The Church couldn't help me. Dustin became worse and more persistant.
I began</B>
<BR><B>to see visions. I saw my brother being chased down a road, over
a bridge and</B>
<BR><B>through smoke. I saw my brother that night...he told me that story
that I had</B>
<BR><B>visualized...bit by bit....he didn't know that I had "been" there.
There were</B>
<BR><B>other events also....if anyone cares to hear or talk about experiences</B>
<BR><B>similar to mine...please email me...I would greatly apprieciate
feedback.</B>
<BR><B>FYI...Dustin has left me be for about a year now...but he might
come back. He</B>
<BR><B>does that sometimes....If anybody has any ideas of maybe getting
rid of him</B>
<BR><B>permentatly...please advise me how.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Scared Me</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Angel51481@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>hi my name is Kathy. I first saw a ghost when I was just 5 years
old, but the most recent one that scared me was at a friend's house. One
night my friend, Charlene and I were just sitting on the sofa watching
TV when we got that feeling that someone was watching us. We knew that
no one was home, but the feeling just got stronger. I have known that I
have had a gift for a long time. I looked around and saw the shadowy figure
of a man standing above us on the balcony. He looked evil with a dark black
aura. I just felt as though that was just one spirit that you don't ignore.
Charlene and I both went outside where we felt safe to decide what to do.
Being witches we decided to put a protection spell on the house. As we
preformed the ritual the spirit got angry. the lights started flikering,
and doors upstairs started slaming over and over again. It was almost like
something out of a horror film, but real. We were so scared, but ever since
that night we have never had a problem with him again. Thanks for your
time. Hope you enjoyed my experience.</B><B></B>

<P><B>By:bsanders04@home.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>when i was a very little girl i always had a feeling that i was not
alone.&nbsp; My first experiance was when i was about six years old. My
mother had come in to check on me during the night because she thought
she heard talking.&nbsp; When she walked in the room i ran into her arms
crying histaracally.&nbsp; She asked me what was the matter i told her
that i had seen i woman in my closet.&nbsp; She thought that i was making
this up so she just put me back it bed and left.&nbsp; She finally relized
that this was not a trick but something was going on.&nbsp; So she asked
me what the lady looked like and i told her that she smiled alot and called
my her angel.&nbsp; I also looked over at the picture of my mother's mother
and said that's the lady right there mommy.&nbsp; she then got real pale
and i asked if i was sure and i said yes.&nbsp; my grandmother died right
after i was born so i never knew what she looked like.&nbsp; My second
and third ghost are not so friendly the were murdered in the the house
that we used to live in and at night they would pinch me or sometimes they
would push me down on the ground they made things move around the house.&nbsp;
And even now i think they moved with us into the new house because every
now and then things will come up missing only to be found in the most obvious
of places!!!!</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Nancy, the Ghost Who Likes Coffee</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: ACB181@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>Well, I'm from Northern New Jersey and the story I'm going to tell
you about takes place in our apartment in a 2 family home. (We live on
the second floor.) I've lived in this house since I was 11. I am now 20
and strange occurences have been happening since day 1. Although, they
come and go in spurt, the appear to me more frequent in the past year or
2. I am now 20. Anyway, when we first moved into this house, I had just
started 6th grade. Starting middle school was a big enough deal as it is!
Nevermind all the kids letting me know that I was moving into the "haunted
house". No one ever passed up a chance to remind me that I was moving into
really haunted house! It scared the crap out of me but it was also kinda
cool that I was the center of attention. My landlords wife even told my
mother that she swore this place was haunted. She mentioned something to
my mom about smelling the strong scent of coffee when no one was making
anyway at weird hours of the night...and other incidents with candles.
In the first few years of living here, my cousin was sleeping over one
night, and she was in the room with my sister sleeping in our bunkbeds
and I was sleeping in the living room. She said that when they went to
bed that she saw someone walk in and out of the room as though they were
looking for something. She came in the living room to tell me that they
were still up and that I could turn the lights on if I needed to. I had
never been in the room. Wasn't me! We never really figured out who that
was. My sister has seen the shadows of figures walking in our hallway.
My mom said that when we first moved here she saw a figure of man walk
into her room at night and stand at the foot of her bed and just stare
at her. She never mentioned this to us until recently because we were younger
at the time and didn't want to scare us. Okay so things seem cool for a
couple years. No one notices anything out of the ordinary besides little
things that were kind of strange but easy enough to shrug off. Okay...now
it's about 99-00. I'm 18, 19 at the time. Little things start happening...to
only me. Like I said before, they come and go in spurts. Anyway, I'll get
to the point. I feel like whatever this "spirit" is taunting me. Such I'll
walk in and out of the living room and the curtains will be shut after
I just opened them, I hear women talking when I'm home alone, nothing I
can understand, the T.V. changes channels on it's own, the radio shuts
off and on, I'll walk into the kitchen and the frig door will be wide open,
lights turn on and off. Now, earlier this year I had a dream in which I
felt that the girl talking to me in the dream was this presence. I couldn't
see her face at all but I was sitting across from her at a table and she
shoved a piece of paper to me with the name "Nancy" on it. Now, In the
past month, thigns have been going crazy. The creepiest thing to me, is
the fact that when I know I'm home alone and even the woman downstairs
is at work, I'll smell the aroma of coffee so strong I almost gag. It will
be 3 in the morning, I'll smell coffee out of nowhere. Just last night,
4:23...the scent of coffee start eminating from the middle of my living
room as though there was an invisible coffee pot there!! The weird thing
is, my family doesn't even own a coffee pot. We hate it! So go figure...it
could be the people downstairs. But at 3 in the morning? And so strong?
Why did the lady who lived here before say the same thing and she lived
here when it was a 1 family home? I don't know. I wouldn't be scared if
it weren't for the fact that recently my diabetic supplies keep dissappearing
right when I'm about to take my shot or test my blood. And then they show
up behind the couch, in my closet, in my dresser, etc. I don't know the
history of this house at all, but I plan on trying to come to some sort
of conclusion. I just wish I knew what "Nancy" was trying to tell me? Maybe
she just misses coffee in the afterlife. Who knows?</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Odd Night in Cornwall</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: LeonardoFink@aol.com</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;</B>
<BR><B>I was recently staying at a Youth Hostel, in Cornwall, England.&nbsp;
The manager warned me jovially when I arrived that there were three ghosts
in the hostel, all linked to different area in the building.&nbsp; He added
with a mischevious grin that one of them had a particualr dislike for the
new computer that had been installed, and seemed to keep switching it off.&nbsp;
He chose to tell me this because the reason I was there was to do some
work with that very computer.&nbsp; After an evening of unproductive work
on a computer that obvioulsy wasn't working prorperly, I retired to the
small private room I had been given.&nbsp; I dropped off to sleep fairly
quickly, but woke up after about an hour feeling cold, the reason for which
became clear very quickly.&nbsp; The duvet from my bed was lying in a heap
on the floor around my feet.&nbsp;&nbsp; I picked it up and covered myself,
but then had trouble getting back to sleep, as the couple in the next room
were being very noisy.&nbsp; Eventually they quietened down and I started
to relax, but before I managed to fall asleep again, the duvet began to
slowly slide down the bed as if pulled from the bottom.&nbsp; I let it
move about six inches to see what was happening, then got hold and pulled
back.&nbsp; Whatever was pulling gave up with relative ease, and I was
soon covered again.&nbsp; At this stage I can remember that rather than
being frightened, I felt as if some silly game was going on, and i was
almost giggling about the fact that some impish ghost had chosen me for
an adversary in it's little game.&nbsp; As a result, after half an hour
or so, I had no trouble getting back to sleep.&nbsp; It seemed however
that I hadn't taken things seriously enough, and had managed to cause offense.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The next time I woke up, it was with a start as the duvet began to quickly
slide of the bed, again in the same direction towards my feet.&nbsp; This
time I decided that enough was enough, and started to feal very afraid.&nbsp;
I started to try and grab the duvet (you know what it's like in the dark
at night, a simple duvet can seem to offer so much protection and security,
and the potential lack of it made me feel very vulnerable).&nbsp; I think
I managed to move about an inch before I found myself suddenly unable to
move anymore.&nbsp; I couldn't actually feel any force or weight holding
me, or pressing down on me, but I was totally unable to move my arms or
any part of my upper body except for my head.&nbsp; Infact it felt like
I was suddenly made from lead.&nbsp; I fought and fought and eventually,
managed to get my fingers to move slightly.&nbsp; As soon as I acheived
this one small movement, everything was fine.&nbsp; The inability to move
evaporated completely, and I was left back in full control of my body.&nbsp;
I pulled the duvet back over myself, and surprisingly I only felt any kind
of fear for a few minutes, and was soon relaxing again.&nbsp; Whatever
the game was all about, it seems that I had won, and that my adversary
had admitted defeat fairly gracefully.&nbsp; I slept perfectly well for
the remaining few hours of the night, and woke up perfectly refreshed in
the morning.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Odd Things that make You Wonder</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: johnkyla@jcn.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>Over my 27 years of life I look back at a few past happenings as
being questionable. When I was a child around the years of 5,6 and 7 I
can remember several times of waking up in the middle of the night and
looking out my door into the hallway and seeing people walking past my
door, I did not know any of them, and I was not terrorfied only bogled.
Another incident that happened, was around those same years I remember
waking up one night and seeing my who thought was my dad leaning over me
watching me sleep, I remember I lying there looking up at this man and
he was kind of blurry but yet I could make out facial features, and he
was smiling at me and i smiled back thinking it was my dad, I had even
closed my eyes at one point and opened them back up and he was still there,
I was not scarred at all, and I drifted back to sleep. The nexted morning
I told my parents that I had seen dad last night but my dad had no Idea
what I was talking about. I dont know if the house was haunted, nothing
scarry ever happened that im aware of, but those occurences have always
made me wonder. Some more rescent things that have occured, about 4 years
ago my husband and me and our two small children moved into this split
level home that was about 20 yrs old nothing spooky about it, Nothing major
really happen, but oneday I had walked down to the lower level to do some
laundry, when I noticed that the bookcase that we had down there was lying
face down on the floor, now this bookcase was about 6 ft. tall. I just
figured my husband must have laided that way for some reason, who knows,
so I picked it up and put back. When I asked Him about it he had no idea
what I was talking about, It kind of spooked me but I just shruged it off,
Afew days later my hubby asked me If I had messed with two pictures that
were on the bookcase down stairs, I said not since I put it back up against
the wall, when I placed them back on the bookcase,there were three pics,
He said the one of his father playing football was fase down on the self,
the one of his mother was face down on the floor across the room and other
pic of my friends kids was left alone. We just kind of stared at each other,
and he said maybe his parents were having a knock down drag out with each
other, and that hopefully thay would keep us out of it( both his parents
are passed, and they never got along ). some time after that my son who
was 2 at the time was playing in his room when he came out and asked me
to turn on the light in his room again. I know I had turned it on in there
a moment ago and he was too small to reach the switch, I figured he must
have moved something up to the wall to reach it, when I got in there nothing
was against the wall, I shrugged it off and turn the laight back on, a
few minutes later here come my son again wanting me to turn the light back
on, I asked him who keeps turning it off, He said "the man in the wall"</B>
<BR><B>I said "What?" and sure enough the light was off again. I ask my
son where the man was he point over to a wall and he said he was kind of
sitting. I told my son to tell the man to stop turning off the light. I
guess the man obliged. later I asked my son what the mans name was, he
said jack, Ironically that was my hubbys dads name. my son was never scared
of "jack" and would see him periodically until we moved 2yrs later, I asked
him if he still sees the man in the wall, and he says he has went home
now. Sorry my letter was so long, just wanted to share these occurances
with you to see if they make anyone else wonder.</B>

<P><B>Fort Huachuca</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: Kendlchk@aol.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>My husband is in the army and we live on a base called Fort Huachuca.
From what I understand it is a really old post dating back to Civil War
times. (I am not exactly sure when the post was started.) We live next
door to an MP (military police). The other night my husband was outside
talking to our neighbor and another MP. They told him about an incident
they had had a couple of days ago. He came home and told me and so I thought
I would share it with you.</B>
<BR><B>At about 2 or 3 in the morning the MPs got a call complaining that
kids were playing in the cemetery. This cemetery is as old as the post.
Well, when the MPs got out there they looked around and could not find
a single person. All they noticed that was kind of odd was that at the
beginning of the cemetery there are a bunch of graves for little kids.
It's enough to make you wonder how so many kids died on this post. So after
looking around and finding no one, they got back in there Jeep and tried
to leave. They got stuck in the mud. After about 15mins they finally got
the Jeep out. The Jeep was covered in mud. They drove down the road to
the fire station where they wash all of the vehicles. When they looked
at the back of the Jeep there was a whole bunch of little kids had prints
in the mud. When my husband told me this story he had chills. He was recently
in the Honor Guard on post. (They do a little ceremony at funerals.)&nbsp;
He has been to the cemetery on Post and has noticed all the childrens graves
at the front of the cemetery. He didn't think anything of it before until
they had told him this story. With Halloween approaching I suggested that
we go to the cemetery. He freaked out and said that he does want to visit
it at night especially on Halloween. Another thing I find kind of odd,
the post has decided that it needs a new cemetery. I have heard many stories
from people here on post. With a post this old, something's are bound to
be haunted.</B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Olive</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: oblivion@alliedcom.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>Here is something that is happening right now.&nbsp; I live in Honolulu.&nbsp;
I</B>
<BR><B>recently broke up with my husband of 9 years, but on amicable terms.&nbsp;
I</B>
<BR><B>moved out and started all over on my own in a little apartment not
too far</B>
<BR><B>from Waikiki (and he lives on the same island).&nbsp; Until this
past summer</B>
<BR><B>there was no sort of ghostly activity, and I've had experience with
spooks</B>
<BR><B>in many places I have lived--my ex is in the Army so we move a lot.&nbsp;
For</B>
<BR><B>example, when we lived in Texas, I saw a yellow orb dart into my
hallway.</B>
<BR><B>At first, I thought it was the brass doorknob to the hallway door
moving in</B>
<BR><B>a breeze, until I realized a few seconds later that the door was
in plain</B>
<BR><B>view, opened the other direction, and stood stationary at the time.&nbsp;
It also</B>
<BR><B>wasn't a child as the one who could walk at the time has dark hair,
not the</B>
<BR><B>golden color I saw, and I checked up on her at the time of the vision
and</B>
<BR><B>found her fast asleep.&nbsp; There are other stories but they aren't
really worth</B>
<BR><B>mention.&nbsp; Anyway, the first clue that there was something else
with me was</B>
<BR><B>when I went to bed, as I put my head on the pillow and lying on
my left</B>
<BR><B>side, I heard a clear, female voice.&nbsp; Now one always hears
chatter going on</B>
<BR><B>in one's head, it's just thoughts rolling about without conscious
direction.</B>
<BR><B>This was not coming from inside my head.&nbsp; This voice spoke
as if the lips</B>
<BR><B>were an inch or so from my LEFT ear, the one pressed into my pillow.&nbsp;
My</B>
<BR><B>mattress and box springs have no frame to rest on; they are on the
floor and</B>
<BR><B>so there could not have been anything under my bed, and I live in
an</B>
<BR><B>apartment that is 4 feet sunken into the ground, so there is no
apartment</B>
<BR><B>beneath me as it is solid earth below my floor.&nbsp; The voice
clearly said,</B>
<BR><B>"What did you dump?"&nbsp; The tone was slightly annoyed, as when
a mother is</B>
<BR><B>trying to discern a problem with a child; and the accent was local,
but not</B>
<BR><B>thick.&nbsp; Needless to say, that startled me wide awake.&nbsp;
I sat up, grabbed my</B>
<BR><B>athame--I'm a practicing witch and an athame is a dagger used symbolically</B>
<BR><B>in ritual, and I was given this one 12 years ago from a beginning
druid</B>
<BR><B>friend who imbued it with a protective quality...so it is very special
and</B>
<BR><B>comforting.&nbsp; When I had calmed down, I told whatever it was
not to do that</B>
<BR><B>again, because it spooked me badly.&nbsp; So far "she" has never
done this again,</B>
<BR><B>but now she's welcome to speak like that because I'm comfortable
with her</B>
<BR><B>presence.&nbsp; Anyway, I call it a "she" because it used a female
voice.&nbsp; I used</B>
<BR><B>a pendulum a few nights later after feeling her hanging about, to
see if I</B>
<BR><B>could get some questions answered.&nbsp; A pendulum uses energy
to swing one way</B>
<BR><B>or another in order to discern things, and one can use it to get
yes/no</B>
<BR><B>answers.&nbsp; I have training in such things so I know the procedures
involved</B>
<BR><B>so as not to open myself to things I don't want around.&nbsp; Indeed,
this ghost</B>
<BR><B>claims to be female, human, and no longer living.&nbsp; I am not
the only person</B>
<BR><B>to have witnessed her.&nbsp; My best friend and fellow coven sister
came by and</B>
<BR><B>asked me to pick up her cousins who were at a mall--they were visiting
from</B>
<BR><B>Australia and could not get around on their own out here.&nbsp;
My friend was</B>
<BR><B>tired, and opted to take a nap while I was out.&nbsp; The spook
would make</B>
<BR><B>whispering sounds by the window, but when my friend looked to see
if anyone</B>
<BR><B>was there, the sounds would cease.&nbsp; My friend finally said,
"Oblivion</B>
<BR><B>[that's my nickname, I'm a goth too] may let you play with her but
I don't</B>
<BR><B>like this so please stop it now."&nbsp; The spook quit making noise.&nbsp;
The next</B>
<BR><B>incident involved "Olive" (so named by me as I walked into my kitchen
and</B>
<BR><B>upon seeing olive oil decided "Olive" was a nice, feminine name)
hiding my</B>
<BR><B>pentacle.&nbsp; I have a pendant of a pentacle, a star point-upward
enclosed in a</B>
<BR><B>circle, fashioned out of silver.&nbsp; I had taken it off its chain
for some</B>
<BR><B>reason or other, and dropped it on the floor by my couch.&nbsp;
No amount of</B>
<BR><B>feeling under my couch would reveal its location, and as I was in
a hurry to</B>
<BR><B>go somewhere, I left it to find at another time.&nbsp; Two days
later I had some</B>
<BR><B>time and pulled the couch away from the wall.&nbsp; I ended up pulling
it so far</B>
<BR><B>away from the wall I could see the whole area of floor it covered
plus a few</B>
<BR><B>inches which are to the front of the couch when it is against the
wall.&nbsp; The</B>
<BR><B>pentacle lay in an area that was not covered by the couch but was
a few</B>
<BR><B>inches in front of the couch when it is against the wall.&nbsp;
It should be</B>
<BR><B>noted that I have dark green, dull tile in my home, so it would
not have</B>
<BR><B>blended away into the color or shine of the floor, and I keep my
silver</B>
<BR><B>items shiny and well-polished.&nbsp; She helped me out one time
by knocking on my</B>
<BR><B>door to wake me up to prevent me from being late to work.&nbsp;
I can see if</B>
<BR><B>someone is by my door within a second of the knock, as my apartment
is very</B>
<BR><B>tiny, and no one was there--I would be able to see if anyone dashed
away.</B>
<BR><B>The next trick she pulled was hiding a cloth I use to clean my sunglasses.</B>
<BR><B>It's a special synthetic cloth that leaves no scratches on lenses,
and it is</B>
<BR><B>also bright orange--hard to miss since most of my things are black.&nbsp;
I keep</B>
<BR><B>it in my purse.&nbsp; One day I wanted to wipe my lenses, and after
digging</B>
<BR><B>through my purse and in fact emptying it out completely, no amount
of</B>
<BR><B>searching revealed it.&nbsp; I thought maybe my daughters had gotten
in my purse</B>
<BR><B>and put the cloth on a barbie doll or something, which meant waiting
until</B>
<BR><B>their next visit to find it.&nbsp; But before the next visit occurred,
I happened</B>
<BR><B>to take my wallet out of my purse and there was the cloth, plain
as the nose</B>
<BR><B>on my face!&nbsp; So far Olive has not dared to hide my keys or
anything else</B>
<BR><B>important, since I have stated to her that it would make me very
cross.&nbsp; But</B>
<BR><B>here is the latest trick of hers:&nbsp; I have had some hard luck
financially,</B>
<BR><B>and I had been complaining to a friend on the internet about it.&nbsp;
A little</B>
<BR><B>later I left my house to take my best friend grocery shopping.&nbsp;
As a habit I</B>
<BR><B>keep my radio on, because my apartment is quite easy to break into
(I have</B>
<BR><B>done so on the occasion of locking myself out, and it is the matter
of using</B>
<BR><B>a flathead screwdriver on a window screen) and the sound of a radio
even in</B>
<BR><B>a dark apartment would give doubt to a would-be burglar as I might
simply be</B>
<BR><B>asleep in the next room.&nbsp; When I came home, I found my radio
turned</B>
<BR><B>off--apparently she had been reading over my shoulder the complaints
about</B>
<BR><B>finances and turned the radio off to conserve electricity!&nbsp;
I have taken</B>
<BR><B>photos when I feel a cold spot, and as this is tropical Hawaii,
it is never</B>
<BR><B>cold, and I have no air conditioning in my place.&nbsp; If any of
them turn out</B>
<BR><B>with something interesting I will scan them and send them to you.&nbsp;
I'll also</B>
<BR><B>keep you posted if Olive commits any additional antics.&nbsp; Thanks
for reading</B>
<BR><B>this and keep up the good work--you've inspired me to begin hunting!</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Our Episodes into the Cemetery</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: tule1@webtv.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>Hello, I have been looking for someone to talk to about some experiences</B>
<BR><B>that my friend and I have had here where we live.</B>
<BR><B>We are both interested in and curious about the paranormal and so
we</B>
<BR><B>decided to go sit up in the cemetary here at night just to see what</B>
<BR><B>would happen.&nbsp; We are both senior citizens in our 70's and
we are living</B>
<BR><B>in a very old tb sanitarium that has been turned into senior housing.</B>
<BR><B>There is a very old peaceful cemetary here up on a hill with a lovely</B>
<BR><B>old oak tree right in the middle. There are many old graves there
and</B>
<BR><B>most from the 1800's with a few recent graves. Anyway, we have sat
up</B>
<BR><B>there and felt 'energy' around us (what we thought felt like energy).</B>
<BR><B>He had a compass and the needle would move.&nbsp;&nbsp; My friend
went up there</B>
<BR><B>alone more often than with me and things always happened.&nbsp;
Once a branch</B>
<BR><B>from the old tree broke and fell beside him when he asked "Is any
one</B>
<BR><B>here".&nbsp; Then once he thought he felt a hand on his wrist and
that same</B>
<BR><B>time his hat kept flying off his head (baseball type cap) 3 times
with</B>
<BR><B>the last time falling several feet away from him.&nbsp; He wouldnt
go up</B>
<BR><B>there alone after that so the last time we went I went with him.&nbsp;
We</B>
<BR><B>would always sit under that old tree when we went there and on that</B>
<BR><B>night he asked again 'Is anyone here".&nbsp; We&nbsp; were sitting
about 3 feet</B>
<BR><B>apart and we both heard a deep voice come out of that tree but we</B>
<BR><B>couldnt understand it. It only said 2 words. We were looking at
each</B>
<BR><B>other in amazment when we heard a lot of words being said from the
back</B>
<BR><B>part of the cemetary but we coudnt understand the words either but
the</B>
<BR><B>voice or whatever it was making that sound had a eerie&nbsp; echoing
ring to</B>
<BR><B>it...it scared us enough to make us leave the cemetary.&nbsp; My
friend fell</B>
<BR><B>going out thru the gate and hurt himself badly.&nbsp; I am afraid
to go back</B>
<BR><B>there now yet we are both intrigued by what happened. I know it
was not</B>
<BR><B>our imagination as we are both pretty level headed. We cannot discuss</B>
<BR><B>this with anyone here either or we will be ridiculed. Can you give
us</B>
<BR><B>any insight as to what it might be?&nbsp; This is a very old</B>
<BR><B>hospital/sanitarium and we think there are what we refer to as 'ghosts'</B>
<BR><B>here. We have both heard noises in our apartments that cannot be</B>
<BR><B>explained and his occurs often while mine only twice.&nbsp; Thank
you for</B>
<BR><B>readng this and any information you send would be appreciated.&nbsp;
We want</B>
<BR><B>to go back with a camera and take pictures but we were intimidated
by</B>
<BR><B>that last experience.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Our Old House</B>
<BR><B></B>&nbsp;<B></B>

<P><B>By: steven.teresa@verizon.net</B><B></B>

<P><B>When I was in high school my family lived in a rented farm house
in the country.</B>
<BR><B>I was 17 and dating a very nice gentleman who had come to visit
with me for the evening.&nbsp; My mother worked nights and usually got
home around 11:00 p.m. or so.</B>
<BR><B>My boyfriend and I were sitting on the floor in the livingroom leaned
up against the couch watching T.V. when the kitchen door opened and the
light came on.&nbsp; We both heard the thump like my mother had put her
purse on the table and then the bathroom door opened and closed.</B>
<BR><B>We both thought that odd because usually my mother would not have
turned on the light because my dad is a light sleeper and the light would
have woke him up.&nbsp; And my mother would have at least said hi to us
anyway.</B>
<BR><B>My boyfriend noticed that it was getting late and he needed to get
home.&nbsp; We had expected snow and he didn't want to be caught in a storm.&nbsp;
I got his coat and we walked to the door together and stood on the back
porch watching the snow fall.&nbsp; AS MY MOTHER PULLED IN.&nbsp; My boyfriend
made us both wait on the porch as he searched the house from one end to
the other.&nbsp; No one was in there other than my sister (upstairs asleep)
and my dad (sound asleep in the back bedroom)&nbsp; Many other things happened
there.&nbsp; More than once we walked into the house and found the washer
or dryer going.&nbsp; My mother was and is a real stickler for not leaving
the house with anything running.&nbsp; Once I saw a lady with long black
hair in a flannel gown standing in the kitchen door.&nbsp; I couldn't see
through her but in a split second,&nbsp; she was gone.&nbsp; She never
hurt any of us but would often make herself known.&nbsp; I kind of miss
that house and the spirit within.&nbsp; Thank you for letting me share
my story.</B><B></B>

<BR><B>Rented House</B><B></B>

<P><B>By: semper_fidelis_4027@yahoo.com</B><B></B>

<P><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My husband, Jason, is a Marine serving a year
tour</B>
<BR><B>overseas. Since it is an unaccompanied tour I can't be</B>
<BR><B>with him so I&nbsp; rent a house in my hometown and live</B>
<BR><B>there alone. I had lived there for months without any</B>
<BR><B>strange occurences until he came home on leave this</B>
<BR><B>past July 4th weekend.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We were laying in bed late one morning when we</B>
<BR><B>heard the sound of our front door open and close and</B>
<BR><B>someone walking through the living room and down the</B>
<BR><B>hall towards our bedroom. Jason yelled " Go away! "</B>
<BR><B>and the footsteps paused and we saw the person's</B>
<BR><B>shadow pass underneathe the closed bedroom door. Then</B>
<BR><B>we heard them go back the way they came and heard the</B>
<BR><B>front door open and close again as they left. Thinking</B>
<BR><B>that it was my mother, who lives across the street, I</B>
<BR><B>got up to see what she had wanted, but when I looked</B>
<BR><B>outside no one was there. We didn't really think much</B>
<BR><B>of it, until we talked to my mother later in the day</B>
<BR><B>and she told us that she had not come over.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That evening, Jason and I were in the car on
the</B>
<BR><B>way to a restaurant when suddenly I was overwhelmed by</B>
<BR><B>this feeling that something terrible had happened and</B>
<BR><B>along with it I felt the distinct prescence of my</B>
<BR><B>friend "Jamey". Then his favorite song came on the</B>
<BR><B>radio. Now, I must give you a little background on</B>
<BR><B>"Jamey" so you can better understand. We had been very</B>
<BR><B>close friends for years until we became involved and</B>
<BR><B>our serious relationship had ended badly about a year</B>
<BR><B>before. I remember thinking how strange it was for</B>
<BR><B>"Jamey" to suddenly come to mind like that since we</B>
<BR><B>had not spoken since we broke up. Anyway, the terrible</B>
<BR><B>feeling stuck with me for the rest of the evening, but</B>
<BR><B>I made no mention of it to my husband because,</B>
<BR><B>afterall, "Jamey" was an ex-boyfriend and I didn't</B>
<BR><B>feel comfortable discussing him with Jason.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That night, we were awakened by a terrifying
array</B>
<BR><B>of noises. It sounded as if someone was stomping on</B>
<BR><B>the floor and banging on the doors and walls, and the</B>
<BR><B>most terrifying of all was the sound of someone's loud</B>
<BR><B>rasping breath. The next morning we talked about it a</B>
<BR><B>little bit but we both kind of attributed it to our</B>
<BR><B>imaginations. Then, I received terrible news. "Jamey"</B>
<BR><B>had shot and killed himself the day before.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The "hauntings" continued throughout the following</B>
<BR><B>weeks and every night they became more and more</B>
<BR><B>frightening. Several nights we fled to my mother's</B>
<BR><B>house and we all watched in horror from across the</B>
<BR><B>street as the lights in our house went on and off by</B>
<BR><B>themselves. We heard whispering and things moved</B>
<BR><B>witout explanation. Our pets began to behave strangely</B>
<BR><B>and worst of all we always felt as if we were being</B>
<BR><B>watched.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We never really made the connection between</B>
<BR><B>"Jamey"'s death and the strange occurences in our</B>
<BR><B>house until I had a poem that he had written shortly</B>
<BR><B>before he died framed and I displayed it on my</B>
<BR><B>entertainment center in the living room in his memory.</B>
<BR><B>Even though we adjusted it to face straight forward</B>
<BR><B>hundreds of times it kept ending up turned sharply to</B>
<BR><B>the right, though everything else on the entertainment</B>
<BR><B>center went undisturbed. Then we realized that the</B>
<BR><B>day that we heard someone come in and out our front</B>
<BR><B>door was the same day and shortly after the time that</B>
<BR><B>"Jamey" killed himself.</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, it came time for Jason to go back</B>
<BR><B>overseas. The "prescence" remains in the house but as</B>
<BR><B>soon as he left the terrifying experiences at night</B>
<BR><B>stopped. It feels as though the entire atmosphere has</B>
<BR><B>changed from hostile to peaceful now that Jason is</B>
<BR><B>gone. The poem still gets turned to the right and</B>
<BR><B>sometimes it even gets hurled to the floor. The pets</B>
<BR><B>still act strange and the TV often goes on and off by</B>
<BR><B>itself and the CD player will come on and select a CD</B>
<BR><B>and song to play even though no one is near it. And</B>
<BR><B>everyone that comes in the house complains of feeling</B>
<BR><B>as if they are being watched.</B><B></B>
