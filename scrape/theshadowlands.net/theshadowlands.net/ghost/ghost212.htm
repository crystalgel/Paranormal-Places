<p><b>&nbsp;</b>

to me.it might make you</b>
<br><b>a believer or it might not,either way i hope you enjoy it.</b>

<br><b>are very deelicious by the way.little smokies are taste smoke sausages
which</b>
<br><b>you can find at your nearest grocery store,so i highly recommend
them to</b>
<br><b>everyone.anyway i had gotten up to lower the air because it was
hot,and i</b>
<br><b>left my wife sleeping and my two kids playing videogames in the
room.as i</b>
<br><b>left i saw the kids get into a small argument.just then i heard
this noise</b>
<br><b>coming from the room i had just left,a noise not from this earth.i
heard the</b>
<br><b>kids screaming for help,i quickly ran back in,what i saw was truely</b>
<br><b>frightning.my wife was talking backwards or in a language ive never
heard</b>
<br><b>before.i got the kids and took them into the living room because
at this</b>
<br><b>point my wife was clawing at everything and throwing things at us.i
left the</b>
<br><b>kids and ran back in to see my wife.when i enter i saw her she was
in a</b>
<br><b>truelly evil form,her eyes were bloodshot red,her teeth looked like
sharp</b>
<br><b>fangs,her nails were like claws now.i told her to calm down what

<br><b>came which seemed like a eternity,we slow came out of the bathroom,and
opened</b>
<br><b>the bedroom door.to my surprise my wife was fast asleep,we woke
her up.she</b>
<br><b>said good morning to us like if nothing ever happened that night.well
up to</b>
<br><b>this day we still cant explain what really happened to her.all we

<br><b>pray it will never come again,for it might be the death of us.so
if anyone</b>
<br><b>has ever had a problem like this,or can give me answer to what really
went</b>
<br><b>down that night i would appreciate it.thank you for reading a tale

<p><b>The Mysterious Painting</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: kat_baker43@hotmail.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>One day my husband and I went out shopping and entered an auction.
We bought</b>
<br><b>a painting that an old lady was selling. The auctioneer claimed
that it was</b>
<br><b>an authentic painting that had once hung in some old castle in France
over</b>
<br><b>100 years ago. My husband and I were really pleased with our purchase
until</b>
<br><b>some strange things started to happen. The painting was hung in
the dinning</b>
<br><b>room. When I dust the house it is always clean and all the paintings
are all</b>
<br><b>put back straight. This one was the only one that kept on going
crooked</b>
<br><b>again. The painting before that didn't do it either and we got somebody
to</b>
<br><b>come see if it was straight or not and he said that it was and it
coulnd't</b>
<br><b>have been unbalanced. Sometimes my husband would get the feeling
that the</b>
<br><b>portraits eyes were following him when he walked through the dinning
room.</b>
<br><b>At first I didn't really believe him and thought that he was playing
a joke</b>
<br><b>on me to freak me out, but several days later I noticed that the
painting</b>
<br><b>was doing the same thing to me. I was getting a little scared and
had no</b>
<br><b>idea what to do or think about it. One day I noticed that the portraits
left</b>
<br><b>hand was down on his lap and normally it was supoosed to be up as
if holding</b>
<br><b>a glass. I glanced at it and then looked away. When I looked back
again the</b>
<br><b>hand was back at it's original position. I thought that I was imagining</b>
<br><b>things, but a few days later my husband told me that the same thing
happened</b>
<br><b>to him when he was walking by. I was really getting scared that
we had some</b>
<br><b>sort of strange painting. For a month I was watching the painting
really</b>
<br><b>closly, but it didn't do anything. After about a month I started
to forget</b>
<br><b>about it and didn't pay as much attention. Then one day I noticed
that the</b>
<br><b>man's shirt's bottons had slightly changed color. Instead of being
white,</b>
<br><b>they turned to some pinky/pearl color. My husbad noticed the same
thing that</b>
<br><b>same evening. Constantly more and more strange things were happening
and I</b>
<br><b>was starting to think that we should get rid of the painting, but
my husband</b>
<br><b>had fallen in love with it and really wanted to keep it. Instead
he moved it</b>
<br><b>to his office. One day I was cleaning the dinnig room and notice
that the</b>
<br><b>painting was back in it's original place again. I moved it back
to the</b>
<br><b>office. That evening when my husband came home from work, I asked
him why he</b>
<br><b>had moved the painting back into the dinning room. He said that
he hadn't. I</b>
<br><b>was really scared now that this painting could also move positions.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One day I decide that I would test if this
painting was really doing it</b>
<br><b>by itself or if it was some joke my husband was playing on me. I
placed the</b>
<br><b>painting in the living instead this time and also kept close watch
on it all</b>
<br><b>day. I went out to go shopping for about an hour and when I got
back the</b>
<br><b>painting had moved back to the dinning room. The next day I placed
the</b>
<br><b>painting in the guest bedroom. And again the painting moved back
to the</b>
<br><b>dinnig room. When my husbad was out on a business trip for a week,
I decided</b>
<br><b>to try the test again. I placed the painting in the living room
again and</b>
<br><b>once more it moved back to the dinning room. I was really scared
now and I</b>
<br><b>locked the painting in the attic. It was covered and in a chest.
A few days</b>
<br><b>later the painting was back in the dinning room. I then told my
husband and</b>
<br><b>that I was going to sell the painting becasue it wouldn't leave
us alone. He</b>
<br><b>was reluctant but agreed. As soon as we got rid of the painting
everything</b>
<br><b>went back to normal again.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Nathaniel Massie Home</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: dlstewart86@hotmail.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here are some of my stories that I
have experienced. I will not</b>
<br><b>include all of them yet, I will wait and see what you think of these
first.</b>
<br><b>I want to say first of all that I believe everything that I'm about
to write</b>
<br><b>and I am the only one that seems to experience them.There are mostly
good</b>
<br><b>spirits that live here, there seem to be a couple of bad that WANT
to scare</b>
<br><b>me but they don't they make me mad! I think they want me to leave
but I'm</b>
<br><b>not afraid. My friends and family definately support and believe
me but only</b>
<br><b>my husband has even heard a couple things but I have heard them
all and even</b>
<br><b>seen them!</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I would like to set the scene if you will, to get a better</b>
<br><b>understanding of our set up. In July of 1999 there was an accidental</b>
<br><b>shooting here and a young teenage girl shot and killed herself in
this</b>
<br><b>house, the family immedialtely moved out afterwards, it was definately
the</b>
<br><b>talk of the town. We knew of the killing when we looked at the house,
but it</b>
<br><b>didn't phase us at all. We just felt sorry for the family that had
to</b>
<br><b>experience such a tragedy. When the landlords showed us the house
and we</b>
<br><b>walked through it all I was amazed at its history that shown through
the age</b>
<br><b>of the house. It had a very sweet spirit about it and I immediately
was</b>
<br><b>drawn to the once beauty it carried. Incase you didn't know.........We
are</b>
<br><b>renting what is called, The Nathaniel Massie Home, an 8 bedroom
2-3 story</b>
<br><b>landmark. It is over 200 years old and has 6 fireplaces. Nathaniel
Massie</b>
<br><b>founded Ross County, Bainbridge, Ohio, Chillicothe, Ohio(Where the
famous</b>
<br><b>Underground Railroad ran through of the slave time) also where Tecumseh
and</b>
<br><b>that Indian history was made. There is so much about this area that
has made</b>
<br><b>history for Ohio. Anyway, thats who Nathaniel Massie was and our
children</b>
<br><b>study him now in their OHIO HISTORY books. My husband didn't really
care for</b>
<br><b>the house because of its deteriation, Its not much to look at at
all. I</b>
<br><b>loved it right away, something just drew me to it and I wanted it,
so we</b>
<br><b>decided to rent it. We only use the middle part of the house and
the other</b>
<br><b>part is used mainly for storage. I don't know exactly when I first
started</b>
<br><b>experiencing things but it wasn't too long after we settled in.
We had ALOT</b>
<br><b>of people asking us if we thought it would be haunted because of
the young</b>
<br><b>girl that was killed. That didn't even spark a worry, nor has that
even came</b>
<br><b>up since we lived here, its the spirits that have been here LONG
before any</b>
<br><b>of us were even thought of............</b>
<br><b>Story #1:</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One night I was laying in bed waiting on
my husband to get out of the</b>
<br><b>shower. I heard footsteps coming down the stairs from the other
side of the</b>
<br><b>house (that we don't use)Our other bedroom door goes into the other
side of</b>
<br><b>the house where the noise was coming from. The footsteps seem to
be so light</b>
<br><b>as if it was a woman or child. I strained my ears to listen and
was a little</b>
<br><b>spooked, but more curious than anything. I heard about 15-20 steps
it seemed</b>
<br><b>then it stopped. I then I felt my husband sit behind me on the bed
and I</b>
<br><b>turned to tell him what I had been hearing and he wasn't there,
yet I felt</b>
<br><b>the weight as if someone sat down behind me. I sat up quickly trying
to</b>
<br><b>focus, the lights were off. I hurriedly got out of bed and turned
the light</b>
<br><b>on...nothing, nobody. I ran into the bathroom to see if he was playing
a</b>
<br><b>trick on me, he was still in the shower. After he got out I told
him the</b>
<br><b>whole story and he just smiled and said Good Night. I KNOW what
I heard AND</b>
<br><b>FELT.</b>
<br><b>Story #2:</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; My husband and I was lying in bed one night and we
heard a woman softly</b>
<br><b>laugh. I raised up and asked my husband if he heard it. He sat up
and said</b>
<br><b>he definately did. I wondered if it was the lady of the footsteps
that I had</b>
<br><b>heard before. He didn't want to talk about it anymore. I wasn't
scared</b>
<br><b>though, she sounded happy. It was not at all a scary laugh.</b>
<br><b>Story #3:</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; Another night my husband and I heard pitter patter of steps
upstairs over</b>
<br><b>our bedroom. (still the part of the house we don't use). I raised
up once</b>
<br><b>again and asked him if he heard it. He said he did and didn't want
to talk</b>
<br><b>about it(he is skeptical and has an answer for everything). I told
him that</b>
<br><b>I wasn't scared at all. He seemed to think it was racoons or something
and I</b>
<br><b>told him that I thought it was a child playing. There is no way
that I</b>
<br><b>copuld see the next day that a raccon could have even got up there.
It was</b>
<br><b>much too heavy of steps to be a mouse or rat or something like that.
It was</b>
<br><b>a child, I know it.</b>
<br><b>Story #4:</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; I was pouring me a cup of coffee one morning and I was in
my kitchen and I</b>
<br><b>heard a young happy male voice greeting me with a, "hello! hello?!"
I</b>
<br><b>quickly answered ,"hello?" My dog started barking up a storm and
to be</b>
<br><b>honest, I thought who had just walked into my house? When I walked
into my</b>
<br><b>dining room where I heard the voice, my dog was in there looking
up as if</b>
<br><b>someone was standing there and barking and barking. I looked and
my door was</b>
<br><b>still locked. NOBODY had came in. I KNOW what me AND MY DOG heard.</b>
<br><b>Again......I wasn't scared but so curious! I went on with my day
and then I</b>
<br><b>saw him!! The young man that matched the voice. He was carrying
in wood to</b>
<br><b>our living room and I know everything he had on down to his boots.
When I</b>
<br><b>saw him it was through my periphial vision. If i tried to get a
good look or</b>
<br><b>stare at him he disappeared. the more I thought about it the more
intrigued</b>
<br><b>I was. I couldn't wait to tell my husband.</b>
<br><b>Story #5:</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; I was cleaning in our living room and I saw "her". A young
beautiful</b>
<br><b>woman. She was carrying a wicker basket of laundry and going out
the same</b>
<br><b>door that "he" had came in carrying wood the other day.(We don't
even use</b>
<br><b>that door, its nailed shut and it has table in front of it, but
they do use</b>
<br><b>it.) She had blonde hair pinned up with a couple of ringlets hanging
down as</b>
<br><b>if she had been working alot and it was coming aloose. She had on
a light</b>
<br><b>blue skirt with a white top and white apron. She seemed so happy
and cheery</b>
<br><b>as so did he. I thought they must be a couple. Again..........when
I try to</b>
<br><b>look on them as to get a complete stare...they disappear.I was not
afraid at</b>
<br><b>all. This was so fantastic to me.</b>
<br><b>Story #6:</b>
<br><b>My family and were sitting in our living room and all of a sudden
across the</b>
<br><b>living room ran a a big white cat!! A typical house cat but it was</b>
<br><b>beautiful!! I hollered, "Did ya'll see that cat???????????????"
My son</b>
<br><b>looked at me with a question....."What cat?" I looked at my husband
and</b>
<br><b>asked him the same. He was reading the paper and he didn't see anything
at</b>
<br><b>all. I told them a white cat just ran across the living room floor
as if</b>
<br><b>chasing a mouse or something. NOBODY seen it...........I DID!!!!!!</b>
<br><b>Story #7:</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; This one convinced me of all!! I seen the whole family!!!
I seen "him" a</b>
<br><b>young brown haired fellow, white shirt tucked in light brown pants,
boots up</b>
<br><b>mid calf,"her" dressed the same as the other day, a little toddler
boy with</b>
<br><b>a white shirt, blonde hair kind of curly, about 4 years old, a baby
girl in</b>
<br><b>white in a similar basket to the one "she" had carried laundry with,
and&nbsp; A</b>
<br><b>BIG WHITE CAT!! I saw all of them and they let me look at them a
while. They</b>
<br><b>all seemed to be posing for me. I think they were all going somewhere,
maybe</b>
<br><b>to church or something. I believe they were a christian family because
their</b>
<br><b>spirit is so sweet and gentle. When I spoke they dissappeared. I
continued</b>
<br><b>to speak anyway letting them know that I was glad they were here
and I</b>
<br><b>wasn't afraid and for them not to be afraid of me. I sat down on
my couch in</b>
<br><b>total astonishment and just thought...I have a whole family that
lives here</b>
<br><b>and they seem to be in another dimension, living carrying on as
if&nbsp; it was</b>
<br><b>still the time they lived in before. They are dressed like in the</b>
<br><b>1700-1800's. We have mininites/amish that live around here and they
were</b>
<br><b>dressed just like them.</b>
<br><b>I will stop at that for now and see what you think so far. I refer
to these</b>
<br><b>spirits that I told you about as "My Family" and almost everyone
knows about</b>
<br><b>them and asks if I have seen "My Family" lately. I have more to
tell good</b>
<br><b>and bad but I don't know if this is boring to you or not or what
you are</b>
<br><b>looking for. Please let me know what you think.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Netherbeings..................</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: MEBFA@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>In 1974-</b>
<br><b>I'd spent the night&nbsp; in a Detroit suburb, called Highland Park.The
house had</b>
<br><b>three levels.The parents of my boyfriend, had just "locked themselves
into</b>
<br><b>thier bedrooms that night"-me, thinking that was a very strange
thing to</b>
<br><b>do;as once upstairs in the old late 1800-1920 homestead. Outdoors,
the kids</b>
<br><b>were playing, shouting,enabling to be cooled with whatever they
could find,</b>
<br><b>through the hot night's air...I'd been playing with my male friend,
and</b>
<br><b>talking-up in the third story attic of that homespace.We'd abated
our</b>
<br><b>clothing, and were now looking for sheets somewhere's located in
the</b>
<br><b>house.While trampling up and down the squared, yet circulared staircase,</b>
<br><b>which creaked, I'd heard the screams of the crowd,enabled from the
small</b>
<br><b>television set located in one of the downstair's parents bedrooms.My</b>
<br><b>boyfriend had told me the place was haunted, and that since this
was once an</b>
<br><b>Indian burial ground-that strange things had happened before, on
the</b>
<br><b>premises.I'd always laugh, and thought that he was just chiding
me for a</b>
<br><b>prank he'd pull on me somewhere down the road.By about 10 p.m.,
after first</b>
<br><b>going out to a place called the Pretzel Bowl, a pool hall, me to
have</b>
<br><b>"Englished" him(one more time!)-we'd decided upon going back to
his folks'</b>
<br><b>place to sleep.Upon entering the upstairs room, my intuition kicked
in, of</b>
<br><b>which mine was as always/has been my salvation; well; I'd let him
sleep in</b>
<br><b>the small twin bed by the outside window.As I sat on the edge of
the bedside,</b>
<br><b>I'd noticed what was believed to be by me a form, figurative, in
the window</b>
<br><b>completely across the street-in another delapelated home.Haloed
in</b>
<br><b>appearance, and not alltogether succinct of its personae,I kept
my eyes on</b>
<br><b>it.I asked my man to wake up, he didn't budge at all...I pulled
the sheets</b>
<br><b>both on him, then off of him...still to no avail...He'd once told
me his</b>
<br><b>parents had lived there since thier marriage (around the early 1900's)-
and</b>
<br><b>had come across all kinds of unfounded noises and such,.. like cans,
and</b>
<br><b>metal bowls being shoved about and like someone was beginning to
make a meal</b>
<br><b>of some proportion..I'd kept that thought in my head while I sat
by him on</b>
<br><b>the small bedset.I'd gotten up in the twilight, to both lock the
door, and to</b>
<br><b>go use the "John".I'd made three steps, then turned to look at my
boyfriend's</b>
<br><b>face-now covered with a sheet. As I closed the door, now within
the locking</b>
<br><b>procedure-(all the rooms had-strangely-locking enablement.) Well,
I turned</b>
<br><b>back towards the small room, complete with it's own doorway and
entrance-and</b>
<br><b>walked in to lie down.I'd figured I'd been asleep for a very short
while,</b>
<br><b>but, awakened to hearing loud noises.Banging, like in the next room,</b>
<br><b>allthough there was none nearby,continued to try to fall asleep-to
no</b>
<br><b>avail.I'd heard loud footsteps appearing to climb the steps up to
the</b>
<br><b>room.As, I slowly brought myself to get out of the bed, and to go
to the</b>
<br><b>door, fully expecting a parent to find us there;I'd seen light-like
that from</b>
<br><b>a flashlight coming up the stairs.No person carrying the light,
just the</b>
<br><b>light itself.That light grew clearer, and wider -now taking up complete</b>
<br><b>stairsteps.I screamed, awakening my male lover, now sending the
afore-opened</b>
<br><b>door to it's enclosure with a loud bang!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"See what I'd
said?"'</b>
<br><b>Over, and out.</b>

<p><b>Ghost are not All Bad</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Paulrm01@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I am telling you this story to prove that not all ghosts are bad!</b>
<br><b>At my old school every year the year eights would do something called</b>
<br><b>community action week.This is where they went all over the village
to help</b>
<br><b>the community.</b>
<br><b>How typical that our group had to help our in the church.Our village
church</b>
<br><b>has been standing from the 12th century and it's not the kind of
place where</b>
<br><b>you could just sit down for an hour in the gardens out front and
read a book</b>
<br><b>or something. it was way to spooky!</b>
<br><b>Anyway, we had to clean the bells at the top of the bell tower,the
stones</b>
<br><b>steps up the top get nawrower and narrower as you get higher.There
are a</b>
<br><b>hundred steps going up!</b>
<br><b>We had finished cleaning the bells when 'Louise' shouted to us it
was lunch</b>
<br><b>time.She got up and ran to the stairs as she tripped and she screamed,
my</b>
<br><b>heart skipped a beat as I knew that if she kept rolling down she
would</b>
<br><b>probably break her neck beacuse of the hard stone steps.We all felt
a strong</b>
<br><b>warm mist rush past us as something caught louise she smiled in
a weird way</b>
<br><b>and said something in french.Weird!{She hates french and she could
never</b>
<br><b>speak fluently in it!We all smelt the scent of roses and then it
all</b>
<br><b>went.Louise was standing on the&nbsp; stairway looking slightly
dazed and she said</b>
<br><b>she felt tired.We were all so freaked by this time that we were
downstairs in</b>
<br><b>a flash.Louise started crying and the vicar asked us what was wrong
he</b>
<br><b>explained that many people had experienced the scent of roses when
they were</b>
<br><b>in trouble up there and the warm mist.I asked him about louise speaking</b>
<br><b>french and he said as much as I know about that is that a freanch
nun was</b>
<br><b>pushed off the bell tower to her death and has kept coming back
since then to</b>
<br><b>save others from being hurt.</b>
<br><b>By this time we all never wanted to go in the church again and we
all wanted</b>
<br><b>to go home.But The vicar said to us at least it is a friendly ghost.</b><b></b>
<p><b>I for one have never been back to the church from that day and I
like to have</b>
<br><b>nothing more to do with ghosts.</b>
<br><b>It was only the other day when I asked her what she felt when the
thing</b>
<br><b>caught her.</b>
<br><b>She said it was like being hugged by an angel.</b><b></b>

<p><b>The Other Linda</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>By:Anonymous</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;This happened way back when I was in high school.&nbsp; Some
time during</b>
<br><b>the day, my best friend Linda told me she was feeling sick and had
called</b>
<br><b>her mom to come bring her home, so she wouldn't be riding the bus
home with</b>
<br><b>me.&nbsp; Later, after school had let out, I was standing in the
parking lot</b>
<br><b>waiting for the bus, and I, several feet away, a girl standing by
a car</b>
<br><b>talking to some boys.&nbsp; The girl looked EXACTLY like Linda,
and was even</b>
<br><b>wearing the same type of coat she had!&nbsp; I was very surprised,
because she'd</b>
<br><b>told me she was going home, and she had no reason to lie to me.&nbsp;
Plus, if</b>
<br><b>she'd lied about being sick in order to get out of school (which
Linda would</b>
<br><b>never had done), why the heck would she have come back to the school
to hang</b>
<br><b>out?&nbsp; Even though I was curious, I never got a chance to go
over and see who</b>
<br><b>this person was, because the bus came at that moment.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Later that evening, I went to the school dance.&nbsp; Linda
had</b>
<br><b>originally been going to come too, but since she was home sick I
went to the</b>
<br><b>dance alone.&nbsp; As I was standing in line waiting to get in the
door, I saw,</b>
<br><b>about 10 to 15 feet ahead of me, this same girl who looked just
like Linda!</b>
<br><b>Wearing that same coat!&nbsp;&nbsp; Once I got inside the school
I looked all around</b>
<br><b>for her, but she was nowhere to be seen.&nbsp; The next time I saw
Linda, I told</b>
<br><b>her about it, and she assured me that she had indeed been home sick
all</b>
<br><b>afternoon, and that if she'd felt well enough to go to the dance
that</b>
<br><b>evening, she'd have called me.&nbsp; We never did figure that one
out, and I</b>
<br><b>never saw this "Linda look-alike" again.</b>
<br><b>THE PHANTOM VITAMINS</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Here's another strange thing that happened years later, that
has</b>
<br><b>always puzzled me.&nbsp; About 10 years ago, I went to the doctor's
for a</b>
<br><b>physical and he told me I needed more fiber in my diet.&nbsp; On
the way home, I</b>
<br><b>stopped at the drug store to buy some sort of dietary supplement
with fiber</b>
<br><b>in it.&nbsp; I found a bottle of something called "Chewable Fiber
Tablets" or</b>
<br><b>something like that; went to the counter and bought it.&nbsp; At
the time, I</b>
<br><b>remember thinking that the guy who rung up the sale bore a slight</b>
<br><b>resemblance to the doctor I had just seen.&nbsp; (This isn't the
strange part; I</b>
<br><b>just mention it to make it clear that I had taken more than just
a passing</b>
<br><b>notice of this man's appearance.)</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Anyway, after a month or so, I ran out of these fiber tablets;
they</b>
<br><b>were really nice tasting and I wanted to get some more.&nbsp; I
went back to the</b>
<br><b>same drug store and looked for them, and couldn't find them.&nbsp;
I asked the</b>
<br><b>pharmacist about them (and I KNOW he was the same guy who had rung
the stuff</b>
<br><b>up the last time I bought it), I described what it was I was looking
for and</b>
<br><b>he checked for it, and he said there was no record that the store
had ever</b>
<br><b>carried such a thing!&nbsp; Unfortunately I had thrown the bottle
away so I</b>
<br><b>didn't even have the empty bottle to show him to prove that I'd
indeed</b>
<br><b>bought this product at this same store!&nbsp; At the time I was
frustrated and</b>
<br><b>annoyed, but later on as I thought of it, it just seems really strange!</b>
<br><b>A THOUSAND POINTS OF LIGHT</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;This one is a little more spooky, although I admit it could
just be</b>
<br><b>a case of I'd just woke up suddenly and merely hallucinated.&nbsp;
Anyway, one</b>
<br><b>night, I was sound asleep when I woke up to the sound of a loud
scream, and</b>
<br><b>then realized that I was the one screaming.&nbsp; My husband came
running in and</b>
<br><b>asked what was the matter, and I didn't have the slightest clue
what had</b>
<br><b>woken me up and made me scream.&nbsp; A few minutes later, I lay
back down and</b>
<br><b>was trying to remember exactly what had happened, or what I'd been
dreaming.</b>
<br><b>I had no recollection of having had a nightmare, but I gradually
remembered,</b>
<br><b>just as I was opening my eyes, seeing something standing by the
bed, it was</b>
<br><b>like a lot of tiny little lights in the vague shape of a person,
and as I'd</b>
<br><b>looked at it, it had quickly dissolved!</b><b></b>

<br><b>Odd Happenings</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: tdog666@worldnet.att.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>This house we moved into was haunted, many people knew it.</b>
<br><b>Nothing much happened until a couple months after we moved in when
I was holding one of my pet hamsters and carrying her up the stairs.&nbsp;
Mind the fact that this hamster was almost four and a half and had never
shown any aggression before.&nbsp; As I was halfway up the stairs my cockatiel
whose cage was in the hallway was flapping around his cage like there was
something messing with him.&nbsp; I talked to calm him down when my hamster
tried to leap from my hands and when I held her she bit through my thumb
and was growling,(wierd for a hamster).</b>
<br><b>The night before we moved out my cousin went to the bathroom and
as she was coming back up the stairs footsteps followed her.&nbsp; She
ran into my room white as ash.&nbsp; I didn't believe her and walked into
the hallway, turning on the light when heavy thuds came up the stairs toward
us.&nbsp; We also smelled heavy onion?&nbsp; My mom appeared by the foot
of the steps and the noises stopped.&nbsp; She was coming to tell us about
what she thought could have been a dream except she was wide awake.&nbsp;
She said that just a few seconds earlier she had seen a young man step
through her window and stand in front of her smiling, then he went towards
where the steps were.&nbsp; She followed and saw us at the top of the steps
as stiff as boards.</b>
<br><b>The next morning I went to the kitchen and saw papers scattered
all over the floor and the heavy board holder they were in sitting neatly
against the wall as if placed there.&nbsp; Problem is that my dad was in
the kitchen an hour before for work and it was hanging on the wall where
it should have been.&nbsp; My mom was in the next room and would have heard
it fall, it was very heavy.&nbsp; There were other things but those were
the most strongest.&nbsp; The house was owned by my grandparents and an
aunt who lived there before us, all three died before we moved in.&nbsp;
The house itself did not feel ominous to me until that last incident I
guess what ever it was wanted us to know what; or who we were leaving behind.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Old Farmhouse</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: pulplr@usmo.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I have had several experiences through the years.&nbsp; I lived in
an apartment that 'breathed' first only when I was around,&nbsp; then when
a select few of my friends were around.&nbsp; They would all go through
the same motions that I had gone through in trying to locate the sound
- to no avail!&nbsp; It was not scary - just amazing.</b>
<br><b>I now live in an old farmhouse (>100 years old) and my roommate
and I often thought the other one was talking to someone else or on the
phone or had the TV on - when this wasn't true.&nbsp; One day we compared
notes - when one of us asked the other who we were talking to!&nbsp; We
both had the same experiences.&nbsp; Again this was not scary - just interesting
- almost comforting!&nbsp; You could almost hear what the voices were saying,
but not quite.&nbsp; There was at least one male and one female voice.&nbsp;
I have lived in this house about 14 years and&nbsp; now live alone,&nbsp;
the voices have almost gone away.&nbsp; Instead of hearing them all the
time, I now only hear them once in a great while - I miss them!!</b>
<br><b>I have had numerous other incidences and coincidences in my life
and only one really scary event.</b>
<br><b>I was living in Florida in the 70's.&nbsp; My husband and I were
sleeping.&nbsp; About 3am we were both awakened and sat up straight in
bed - because of a 'noise'.&nbsp; Only it was not really a 'noise' it was
a vibration - high screeching metallic vibration - almost 'visible' - very
unnerving.&nbsp; We both had the same experience with the vibration.&nbsp;
We got up to look around and every cabinet in the kitchen was open.&nbsp;
There was a refrigerator shelf that had been stored away, back between
the stove and a cabinet - it was laying in the middle of the floor!!&nbsp;
We were both truly frightened.&nbsp; Needless to say, we both were awake
the rest of the night with the lights on!!&nbsp; And didn't really sleep
well again while we were living there.</b>
<br><b>I have never 'seen' anything - just felt things.&nbsp; I have always
felt 'protected'.&nbsp; I have always considered myself something of a
white witch, although that is not something I usually tell anyone else.&nbsp;
I cast a spell once in my life because some people were breaking into my
house.&nbsp; And actually caught them in my house a couple days later when
I just HAD to return to my house RIGHT THEN although it was way out of
my way to do so.&nbsp; Then got their license plate number and called the
police.&nbsp;&nbsp; (They had been breaking into numerous houses and boats
and had hurt people.&nbsp; They spent a lot of time in jail!)</b>

<br><b>Old House Ghosts</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: nmcafee@earthlink.net</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>I live in a very old rowhome in Philadelphia, PA with my husband
and our cat.&nbsp; We have lived there for a little over a year now, and
it is obvious that we have a few extra occupants.</b>
<br><b>When we first went to check out the house, it had a weird feeling
to it.&nbsp; Not bad or scary....just not normal.&nbsp; I considered not
renting it, but the rent is dirt cheap and its a great little house, so
I just figured I could live with it....and I was right.&nbsp; It still
isn't scary or malevolent feeling...</b>
<br><b>The first ghost we saw was a cat.&nbsp; Our house is an expanded
trinity, which means that we've got a small basement, a first floor with
the livingroom and kitchen, enclosed spiral stairs to the second floor
(bedroom and bathroom), and another enclosed spiral staircase to the third
floor (a single bedroom).&nbsp; To give you an idea of how tight the staircases
are, we had to hoist all of our furniture through the windows.&nbsp; At
any rate, we have a ghost cat that we'll see only in the second floor hall
and on the stairs to the third floor -- it's a small cat, brownish.&nbsp;
Definitely not scary or spooky, but it can be unnerving if you're not expecting
it, and the cat has scared the crap out of several of our living houseguests!&nbsp;
My mother was visiting once and almost fell down the stairs because she
thought she had stepped on our pet cat, only to realize that her foot went
right through the cat!&nbsp; And, of course, our pet cat flips out when
the ghost cat makes an appearance.</b>
<br><b>The second ghost is a woman that likes to lounge on our bed.&nbsp;
I was standing at my dresser mirror putting on a pair of earrings one morning.&nbsp;
The mirror is almost directly across the room from our bed -- I happened
to glance up just in time to see a thin woman in a long nightgown with
brown hair tied in a bun sort of drape herself over the head of our bed.&nbsp;
My husband, who has never lived in a haunted house before meeting me, gets
seriously freaked out when I tell him about ghosts in the house, so I didn't
tell him about it....until he started to tell me that something was poking
him in the ribs in bed....and it wasn't me.&nbsp; We've also felt her sit
at the bottom of the bed when we're trying to sleep, and we've both gotten
a poke or two from our bedroom ghost.</b>
<br><b>The latest twist in all of this is a whitish-gray figure that will
peek its head and torso out at us while we're in the livingroom.&nbsp;
It is almost as if the figure is standing in the kitchen behind the doorway
to the livingroom, and every now and then, he'll just poke his head out.&nbsp;
I get the distinct feeling its a male presence.</b>
<br><b>Like I said, it can be a little unnerving if you're not used to
it, but it is by no means a scary house.&nbsp; And we're not planning to
move anytime too soon! Thanks for letting me share!</b><b></b>

<br><b>Oreo</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: piperhp3@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Ok, this is a story that i dont tell anymore because i'm tired of
being</b>
<br><b>laughed at... but you might believe it. Ok when i was 9 I got this
kitten</b>
<br><b>that I named Oreo. I got Oreo for birthday in September and one
morning in</b>
<br><b>November I was leaving for school when I picked up Oreo to kiss
him</b>
<br><b>goodbye... well Oreo fell over and I picked him up and he started
to</b>
<br><b>convulse (like he was having a seisure) and then died right in my
arms. I</b>
<br><b>was very sad and I wanted Oreo to be pretty so I went into my mom's
fabric</b>
<br><b>and got a long tourquise blue silk ribbon (it was the big thick
kind) and</b>
<br><b>tied it around his neck and my dad buried him. A week later these
new little</b>
<br><b>stuffed kittens came out and i saw on the commercial that one looked
like</b>
<br><b>Oreo so my dad bought me one. Well when he handed me the little
box i</b>
<br><b>remember that i got this awful chill that went up the spine of my
back but i</b>
<br><b>didnt think much of it. When i took the kitten out of the box i
almost</b>
<br><b>dropped it because it had the same exact markings as my deceased
kitty!! The</b>
<br><b>kitten (stuffed) had a black head with a white face and a black
back with a</b>
<br><b>white belly and legs but the weird thing is that he had a ring of
white</b>
<br><b>around his tail just like Oreo! Well that was weired but i've got
more to</b>
<br><b>the story... one night i was talking with my little stuffed kitty
(remember</b>
<br><b>that i was 9 at the time) when i looked at him straight in the face
and the</b>
<br><b>he winked at me, well after that i threw him across the room because
I</b>
<br><b>couldnt look at him no more. Two nights later when I was sleeping
I felt a</b>
<br><b>cat laying on my chest and i really didnt think anything of it because
my</b>
<br><b>sister had a cat too, but when i looked up in a sleepy daze i know
that it</b>
<br><b>was Oreo (the dead one) but i didnt do anything because i feel back
asleep</b>
<br><b>an it didnt accure to me what had happened until the next morning
when i</b>
<br><b>woke up and looked for him because i then remembered that he was
dead!!</b>
<br><b>Well, no one ever believes me because they say that i'm making it
up and</b>
<br><b>they say that the only cat that was on me that night was my sister's
cat</b>
<br><b>(she's was also black and white) but i knew my cat and it was him.
I havent</b>
<br><b>seen anymore "sightings" of Oreo and i'm now 16, but i thought that
this</b>
<br><b>story might interest you.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Our Funny Old Guy</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: stacysan@flash.net</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>I have been a lucky lady to have had such a funny ghost in my house.&nbsp;
I named him Oscar because that was the name that came to me when I asked
him who he was.&nbsp; I’m not really sure if it was him or me that gave
me that answer. The only reason I think that he was an old guy is from
my perceptions, and what he did. Anyway, this old guy used to walk through
my room.&nbsp; You see we lived in a split level house in northern California.&nbsp;
My room was directly above our dining area.&nbsp; Every time we sat down
to eat, the ceiling above us creaked exactly like someone was walking through
my room.&nbsp; My folks even joked about that.&nbsp; Also, my room was
always terribly cold.&nbsp; That was part of the joke as well.&nbsp; No
matter what the thermostat read, my room was freezing.&nbsp; I only lived
there for one year, but I am well aware of how many blankets I needed to
get through the night.&nbsp; My very Christian family even began a family
joke about the ghost walking around in my room.&nbsp; I’m serious, every
time we sat down to dinner, this guy started his trek across my room.&nbsp;
No one was ever frightened.&nbsp; I wasn’t even afraid to stay in my own
room.&nbsp; Oh, did I mention he used to change the TV channel, turn it
off and on at his will. For instance I would be walking out the door in
the middle of the day and turn it off just to watch it turn back on like
he was saying “I was watching that”. He did a lot of that, changing channels,
turning the TV off and on.&nbsp; Not only once but up to 3 times in a row.&nbsp;
But here’s what really made me giggle.&nbsp; One night, my folks were out
of town.&nbsp; I had just graduated from college. I vividly remember this.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I was laying on the floor watching TV with only my cat laying there with
me.&nbsp; I’m a total night owl and was thinking to myself&nbsp; I needed
to get to bed.&nbsp; Well, almost immediately the TV turned off.&nbsp;
I reached over to the remote and turned it back on.&nbsp;&nbsp; The TV
turned back off and I said out loud something to the affect of give me
just a minute and I promise to go to bed.&nbsp; I only sat there for about
15 mins. and then went to bed.&nbsp; After I moved to away to Texas he
started walking past my room into my dad’s office next door.&nbsp; I remember
asking my mom about him when I moved. She said he wasn’t up to his pranks
any more, but he was walking all the way across the floor/ceiling now.
I actually visited them and heard him go across the entire floor.&nbsp;
My room wasn’t cold anymore either. Was this a ”haunting” or some spirit
watching out for me?&nbsp; I don’t know.&nbsp; My folks moved and he didn’t
go with.&nbsp; As far as I know I haven’t run into him since then either.&nbsp;
I just thought you would like a not so scary/funny but true visitation
story…..We loved that guy.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Our Ghostly Roommate</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: ERooney@ocri.ca</b><b></b>
<p><b>Love the site!&nbsp; The stories are great.&nbsp; I've been visiting
the site for a</b>
<br><b>few years and have finally decided to tell my story.&nbsp; Nothing
spectacular,</b>
<br><b>but supernatural none the less.&nbsp; I have always been interested
in ghosts</b>
<br><b>etc., but was more into it as a child.&nbsp; Thanks to your site,
I'm beginning</b>
<br><b>to delve into it again.&nbsp; Anyway, here's my story.</b>
<br><b>Although I haven't had a lot of encounters (for lack of a better
term) with</b>
<br><b>anything ghostly, I definitely have an ability to sense when something</b>
<br><b>supernatural in nature is present.&nbsp; I can't remember exactly
when and where</b>
<br><b>I had my first experience, but I'm assuming it took place when I
was a</b>
<br><b>child.&nbsp; I have always had extremely vivid dreams, and learned
at an early</b>
<br><b>age how to alter me dreams when they would scare me.&nbsp; As I
said, I haven't</b>
<br><b>had a lot of encounters, but the ones I have had are definitely
memorable.</b>
<br><b>I lived in a house in Kelowna, BC for a few years while in my early
20s,</b>
<br><b>which is where the majority of these encounters took place.&nbsp;
Needless to</b>
<br><b>say, being young, there was a lot of partying going on, so the exact</b>
<br><b>chronological timing of these may be a little off.&nbsp; I should
point out that</b>
<br><b>none of the following experiences took place during parties, and
I wasn't</b>
<br><b>the only one who experienced them.</b>
<br><b>The first one I had I remember quite vividly.&nbsp; I was alone
in the house (my</b>
<br><b>two roommates were out for the evening) with my cat cleaning my
room.</b>
<br><b>Suddenly one of the kitchen cupboard doors slammed shut.&nbsp; Both
my cat and I</b>
<br><b>were in my bedroom and none of the windows in the house were open.&nbsp;
I had</b>
<br><b>just been in the kitchen and none of the doors had been open.&nbsp;
I walked out</b>
<br><b>into the kitchen (my bedroom was right off the kitchen), didn't
see</b>
<br><b>anything, but definitely felt something.&nbsp; It wasn't threatening
by any</b>
<br><b>means, but nonetheless, I could feel it there.&nbsp; Needless to
say, I was a</b>
<br><b>little freaked out, so I went around and turned all the lights on
in the</b>
<br><b>house and went back into my room.&nbsp; A few days later, I was
sitting in the</b>
<br><b>living room with my roommates, eating my dinner off of the coffee
table,</b>
<br><b>watching TV.&nbsp; I was sitting on the floor and suddenly saw a
figure standing</b>
<br><b>in the door to my roommates' bedroom.&nbsp; Their bedroom was at
the front of the</b>
<br><b>house (as was the living room; the bedroom being off to the side)
with a</b>
<br><b>window that faced the road.&nbsp; Jeff, one of my roommates, stood
in the doorway</b>
<br><b>(about a foot back from the actual door frame) so we could try and
figure</b>
<br><b>out what I had seen, but we couldn't see him in the dark.&nbsp;
A car drove by</b>
<br><b>outside and the lights flashed in through their window and illuminated
him</b>
<br><b>from the side.&nbsp; That was exactly what I had seen.&nbsp; All
the hair on my arms</b>
<br><b>and neck stood up.&nbsp; That was only a few days after the cupboard
door</b>
<br><b>incident, so we came to the conclusion that we weren't alone in
the house.</b>
<br><b>Nothing really happened for the next few months and my roommates
moved and</b>
<br><b>two other friends moved in.&nbsp; This is when the really weird
things began to</b>
<br><b>happen.&nbsp; One of my roommates, Chris, came home one night (myself
and other</b>
<br><b>roommate were both out) and found one of the pieces from the chandelier
in</b>
<br><b>the kitchen on the floor, quite a distance from the actual light
fixture.</b>
<br><b>He then stood and watched as the chandelier swung wildly back and
forth.</b>
<br><b>Again, no windows were open and there was no one else in the house.&nbsp;
Once it</b>
<br><b>had stopped swinging, he tried to re-enact what could have happened
with the</b>
<br><b>piece from the fixture, but there was no way the piece could have
landed as</b>
<br><b>far away as it had without being thrown or placed there, even with
it</b>
<br><b>swinging wildly.&nbsp; I should add that the chandelier was a cheap
fake, and all</b>
<br><b>the pieces were plastic, not crystal, and they had no weight to
them</b>
<br><b>whatsoever.&nbsp; We came home to Chris sitting in the living room
with all the</b>
<br><b>lights on and looking quite pale.&nbsp; After explaining what happened
he said we</b>
<br><b>weren't the only ones in the house.&nbsp; I hadn't mentioned anything
about my</b>
<br><b>previous experiences the either of them, so there was no way he
could have</b>
<br><b>known about something being in the house.</b>
<br><b>At one point, we had several of our friends staying with us for
an extended</b>
<br><b>period of time.&nbsp; There were roughly 7 of us in the house, as
well as other</b>
<br><b>friends that would generally be there most of the time.&nbsp; With
the amount of</b>
<br><b>people that were at the house at any given time, there was usually
a "party"</b>
<br><b>going on every night (at least 10-12 of us, so that would qualify
as a</b>
<br><b>party).&nbsp; When our friends had first come to stay with us, I
had told the</b>
<br><b>"spirit" to let us know if we started to offend or upset it in any
way.</b>
<br><b>After about a month or so of our friends staying with us (and the
constant</b>
<br><b>partying), we were in the kitchen making dinner when suddenly the
kitchen</b>
<br><b>lights and the stove shut off.&nbsp; I went in to the bedroom with
a flashlight</b>
<br><b>to throw the breaker switch (the house was about 60 or 70 years
old and had</b>
<br><b>only a crawl space for a basement) as the bedroom was apparently
on the same</b>
<br><b>breaker as half of the kitchen (the fridge on the opposite side
of the room</b>
<br><b>did not go off).&nbsp; We continued to make our dinner and everything
turned off</b>
<br><b>again.&nbsp; After the third time, my roommates and I looked at
each other and</b>
<br><b>said "That's the sign.&nbsp; Sorry guys, but it's getting to be
a little too much</b>
<br><b>having all of you here.&nbsp; Love to have you guys stay longer,
but the house</b>
<br><b>has spoken."&nbsp; I know it sounds a little corny, but we all knew
what was</b>
<br><b>happening.&nbsp; I can still remember that day as clear as a bell
and that was</b>
<br><b>over 5 years ago.</b>
<br><b>That night we were all sitting outside and started to tell each
other the</b>
<br><b>things that we had seen or experienced.&nbsp; It turns out we weren't
the only</b>
<br><b>ones who had had odd things happen to us.&nbsp; A few of our friends
that had</b>
<br><b>lived in the house before I had were over that night.&nbsp; They
started to tell</b>
<br><b>us some things and it turns out a lot of people had heard or seen
the same</b>
<br><b>things.&nbsp; We had a large living room with two couches, one being
a</b>
<br><b>hide-a-bed, so anyone that needed to stay the night and not drive
home</b>
<br><b>could.&nbsp; They had heard someone walking above them in the front
right corner</b>
<br><b>of the living room, even though the house was a bungalow.&nbsp;
The toilet would</b>
<br><b>flush by itself.&nbsp; They would get that odd feeling that someone
was watching</b>
<br><b>when no one else was in the house.&nbsp; The light fixture in the
kitchen would</b>
<br><b>swing when no doors or windows were open in the house.&nbsp; Things
would</b>
<br><b>disappear on us and after looking for several minutes to several
days, we</b>
<br><b>would find it in one of the first places we had looked.&nbsp; After
our friends</b>
<br><b>left and the partying slowed down, we didn't have any problems (except
for</b>
<br><b>the normal everyday occurrences we had become used to).</b>
<br><b>Like I said before, we never felt threatened at all.&nbsp; I have
had the</b>
<br><b>threatening feeling before, so I had something to compare it with.&nbsp;
A friend</b>
<br><b>of mine had moved into an extremely nice basement apartment of a
three level</b>
<br><b>house and was showing it to me one day.&nbsp; There was a laundry
room at the</b>
<br><b>back that gave the creeps.&nbsp; (Anytime I went to see her, I wouldn't
go near</b>
<br><b>the back of the house.)&nbsp; The apartment on the main floor (directly
above</b>
<br><b>her) was up for rent and she wanted me to check it out.&nbsp; The
last people</b>
<br><b>that had lived in the house had been drug addicts and had trashed
the place</b>
<br><b>(which was too bad as it was a very nice old house and the other
apartments</b>
<br><b>were in great shape), so the landlord was offering one month's rent
free if</b>
<br><b>you fixed the place up. As soon as I went through the door I froze.&nbsp;
I was</b>
<br><b>terrified.&nbsp;&nbsp; My friend walked ahead telling me about the
house (thinking I</b>
<br><b>was still behind her) while I was still standing at the front door.&nbsp;
I just</b>
<br><b>couldn't go into the apartment.&nbsp; I think I might have walked
into the living</b>
<br><b>room, but that was as far as I went.&nbsp; I would have to say I
haven't had that</b>
<br><b>feeling before or since, and I hope I never will again.&nbsp; I
have had that</b>
<br><b>feeling of something else being around me before, but nothing as
evil</b>
<br><b>(again, for lack of a better term) as that.</b>
<br><b>As I'm typing this and thinking about our ghostly roommate I realize
that we</b>
<br><b>really got used to having it around.&nbsp; Life was never boring
in that house.</b>
<br><b>A lot of the things sound a little cheesy (lights going off, toilet
flushing</b>
<br><b>etc.), but I'll tell ya, they were a little unnerving at the time.</b><b></b>

were happening. To begin with as we were so young and nieve we understood
it in our own way but thinking we were the only ones tried to ignore it.
It was as i remember nightmares of a brutal looking "shadowy man" and certain
objects in my room moving about or dissapearing and than appearing a few
months later. It wasn't until me and my sisters blamed each other for taking
the objects that we got together and began to realise just exactly what
was happening. Then we all noticed we were getting blamed by our parents
for things of theirs going missing as well. Unfortunatly as we discovered
more and more as to what was going on in our house things began to get
more intense. It got to the point when we would always go upstairs as a
group and never on our own because we felt that we weren't strong enough
individually to cope with it. Once (gradually) as we got older we became
more independent and could venture around on our own. Things in the house
calmed down after a while and than mum took Abby to on side and asked her
discreatly if she had noticed anything e.t.c. Abby then discussed it with
the rest of us and we sat down with mum and told her everything. She was
very relieved because she thought that she was the only one who noticed
anything or had anything happen.As the truth was now out that we all knew
about the house we watched dad to see how he acted when things were happening
but he has seemed oblivious to all that happened. Although he has noticed
things such as a blury shadowy shape of a cat jumping through his head
and out of the window and another running past the patio doors about 3ft
off the ground. He has also been at the dinner table with us when the door
handle has gone up then down and then the door opened wacked into the wall
then smashed back into the door frame and shattered the glass. But dad
being dad has always come up with a far fetched logical explanations such
as it was a sudden hard gust of wind or the cat or something of the kind.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Leaving dad out of the picture all of us would gang together
and work together to try and get rid of "them" as things began to get worse
towards the summer holidays and i got hurt because while i was sat infront
of my wardrobe i had a hail of metal coat hangers rain down on me with
unnatural strength leving me with scars on my knees and bruises&nbsp; all
down my arms and legs.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; This was when one of mums clients a healer (reiki) got talking
to mum. Michele the healer did some healing on my knees (because i have
weak and knock about knees) and also worked on my asthma. Talking to her
she became surprised at how mature me and my sister's had become about
the whole shadowy ghost things in the house.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; Once back from Michele's house i noticed a male "presance"
in my room it turned out to be a guy called Ray and he used to be a teacher.
He looked after me and ever since he came into my room were he would sit
by my fish tank and really seemed to like them. I never had nightmares
and i could feel the pressure of the shadow things trying to get into my
room but they couldnt because Ray was in there. He even woke me up one
night and told me to go to my parents room quickly so i did and then i
collapsed on the floor an had a severe asthma attack and was servearely
dehydrated and went to hospital for a month.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I have allways thought of that as Ray trying to save me for
which i thank him VERY MUCH. my sister became ill with glandular fever
and then went to Michelles house for a healing session she came back changed
and no longer ill and through talks with Michelle became more aware of
the house. Michelle and Cathy(her pupil in training) then came round and
began to "clear" the house. In the treatment room mum and Abby had a very
nasty experience where the devil in the form of a dog had been and the
dog marked the place whereand procceded to growl and bark and wouldn't
let abby in and this resulted with abby in tears. Michelle asked what in
that room my mum saw abby as and she replied the virgin mary and at the
time my sister(15) was unknowenly pregnant and she ended up having a miscarrige.
The baby girl was called Emily. I have encountered the "dog" many times
now on my own or with my sister's i have seen it in the kitchen, our new
bathroom, the lounge, the extension, and down the bottom of the garden.
It is unplesent whenever you meet this "dog" but im getting used to it
although therewas a nasty experiance&nbsp; because my sister got rid of
ray although hes back now and the dog took the opertunity and i spent a
very disturbed night when the dog procceded to jump up onto my bed and
stand there on top of me and growl in my face.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; He has done the same before to Abby.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; In my room it is very peculiar. i have a strange relationship
with my room and always feel protected by ray now hes back but everyone
even the healers feel uneasy and think there is and evil presance in there
but for me it is the only place where&nbsp; i feel safe.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;Lisas room being a new extension has had a fair amount of
disturbances with shadow people and unease whenever you walk past it also
the "dog" a couple of times. she also has the misfortune of looking out
directlly over our back garden where scary things that you cant pinpoint
happen and the same with our pool.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; Abbys room i find extreamlly scary it is opposite the stairs
where abby and i have seen a guy in dark clothing doing an unnatural leap
over the top of our stairs. she also has our old playroom and i have allways
seen shadows in there and i find that i never feel safe in abbys room unless
she is in there with me. My parents room is the worst though on many occasions
i have walked in there and seen an image of a dark body (thinking about
it similar to the one jumping over the stairs) hanging from a lightning
struck tree.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; Our house we have discovered,using help from the healers
holds many secrets. We have a girl aged 11 in our study who was buried
alive by her dad. A dead baby in the corner of my room. A man in the lounge
who has huge pins sticking out of the remainders of his legs (he seems
so evil). We also have a killer in our house. This is a man who walks around
as he pleases and his face is always in shadow but the feeling your get
when he is near is intense evil as he walks around smirking with a shovel
over his sholder.</b>
<br><b>Our front garden is an area where i feel safe unless i have my back
to the house or am looking directly at the house. The path infront of our
house is a place where i do not linger for long though.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; I am very sorry as this e-mail is rather muddled in a sense
that i have not told you everything in the order that they happened. This
is because my sister's (who are here now) have just reminded me of the
pictures on our landing that change depending on the mood of the house.
There was a picture of a little girl stood near a fish bowl holding a candle
and a puppy with a bow round its neck on the floor by her feet. This picture
would change in that the little girl would get red eyes or the bow on the
puppy would change round sometimes the candle was lit other times it was
out. Other things happened in the picture but as my sister's and i complained
about it to our parents the removed it.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; I hope this has been of intrest to you and i am gratefull
that at least we had some one to turn to eventually and although our house
continues to get worse we counter it because one reason Michelle never
comes around any more is because she finds me and abby scary because apparently
we are hidden witches and have a great deal of strength and can do things
without thinking.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; If you wish to e-mail me back (and i hope you will because
i would like to know more about your experiances) please can you e-mail
me on:&nbsp; clarizx@hotmail.com</b>
<br><b>because the e-mail i am sending from is my dads and as ive described
about him above he dosn't believe in these things and would be angry if
he knew i was writing to you about this because i think he doesnt like
what he doesnt understand. and he will probably send you a nasty e-mail
(if he could work out how to use the computer that is) or delete it as
junk.</b>

<p><b>we bought our home in 1993.&nbsp; the first "experience" we had was
shortly after</b>
<br><b>that when my husband had a dream.&nbsp; in the dream a woman sat
on the end of the</b>
<br><b>bed, woke him, and told him he left the front door unlocked. he
said he could</b>
<br><b>feel the pressure on the bed where she sat as if was not dreaming.
he got up</b>
<br><b>to check the door and yes it was un locked.&nbsp; not to long after
that i was</b>
<br><b>sitting on the couch.&nbsp; it faces the hall doorway. out of the
corner of my eye</b>
<br><b>i could see a bright blurred something peeking are the door jam.&nbsp;
it was head</b>
<br><b>high to an adult and it was like someone just peaking around the
corner. but</b>
<br><b>everytime i would look directly at it, it would disappear.&nbsp;
over the years we</b>
<br><b>have either seem things or heard unexplained sounds.&nbsp; not only
my family but</b>
<br><b>a few friends have too.&nbsp; my sister was awaken by someone calling
her by name</b>
<br><b>and telling her to get up.&nbsp; no one was at home at the time.&nbsp;
she and my</b>
<br><b>roommate have both heard a child's voice.&nbsp; my roommate has
felt the pressure</b>
<br><b>of a comforting hand on her shoulder.&nbsp; i have seen my bright
blurr on three</b>
<br><b>different occassions, each time it was a little bigger.&nbsp; i
was awaking one</b>
<br><b>night at 2:00 am by the sounds of the local raccoons dumping over
the trash</b>
<br><b>cans. i started to go out to pick them up but decided to go back
to bed.&nbsp; as</b>
<br><b>i turnd back to bed i notice a candle i had lit earlier was still
burning.</b>
<br><b>it sat on my headboard right above my head.&nbsp; i blew out the
flame and went to</b>
<br><b>sleep.&nbsp; at sunrise i went out to pick up the trash can i had

<p><b>Papa</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: tor-belgroup2@home.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Thanks to everyone who has shared their experience on this site.
It has made me more comfortable to share my own.</b>
<br><b>Several years ago (I was pregnant with my 1st chid), my grandfather
("Papa") became very ill for several months. It was especially hard since
I was very excited to be having a baby, which would have been Papa's 1st
great-grandchild. Sadly though, my Papa died while I was six months pregnant.</b>
<br><b>I live several hours away from my grandparents, and we drove up
for the funeral. Upon arriving at my grandmother's house, I noticed as
we parked that I could see the back of a man in her bedroom window (I would
like to point out that my Papa always wore white and/or with stripes button
down cotton shirts). He was wearing such a shirt. My first thought was
that it must have been my uncle watching his boys playing the keyboard
in the bedroom, but as we sat in the driveway for a moment, I realized
that, to me, it sure looked like my grandfather. I got the chills, but
thought it must be in my head, and we went into the house.</b>
<br><b>Imagine my surprise when I came into the living room, and my uncle
came out of the bedroom wearing some dark blue shirt, not the typical Papa
shirt, which I had seen the man in the bedroom wearing.</b>
<br><b>I realized that Papa had been in the bedroom watching the boys.
I like to hope that Papa made himself visible to me to let me know he is
OK.</b>
<br><b>Thank you for reading my experience.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Paranormal</b><b></b>

<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi my name is Samantha andI have always
been interested in the</b>
<br><b>"paranormal" but the first thing that made me really want to know
more about</b>
<br><b>it was when my dog died. It was about 5 years, I was about 9 years
old. I</b>
<br><b>used to have this old dog named Rocky he was about 16 and was so
cute. It was</b>
<br><b>a Tuesday. I had just got home from school when my Mom told me the
bad news!</b>
<br><b>That she had decided to put Rocky to sleep. We had a beautiful funeral
with</b>
<br><b>my Mom, dad, and my next door neighbor, Emily. I even got to see
Rocky be for</b>
<br><b>we buried him! And trust me never let a kid at the age of 9 see
there dead</b>
<br><b>pet! Every thing seemed normal until that night!</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You have to know something about
Rocky to under stand this part, He</b>
<br><b>was a very sick dog and had really bad coughing problems and occasionally
his</b>
<br><b>hip would come out of place and he would just fall over. So that
night right</b>
<br><b>before I went to bed I heard Rocky coughing (would know that cough
anywhere</b>
<br><b>it was like no others i had ever heard before) and of course I freaked
and</b>
<br><b>ran in to my parents room and my Mom said she heard it too but that

<p><b>Pep Rally</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: wgrolfson1@aol.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>Greetings,</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; I guess it was about 1977. I was in 8th grade. We were having
a mid-day pep</b>
<br><b>rally in the gymnasium of our Junior High School which, 5 years
prior, was</b>
<br><b>the High School and many years before that was the campus of Central
Normal</b>
<br><b>College (aka Canterbury College) of which currently only 1 building
remains,</b>
<br><b>Hargrave Hall.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; Hargrave has it's own silly stories; The late night janitor
who backed out</b>
<br><b>a window to his death in fear of "Mister Hargrave," The "Screaming
Door"</b>
<br><b>where some previous student was locked in a closet overnight as
a joke and</b>
<br><b>was never heard from again (except, of course, at midnight when
the moon is</b>
<br><b>full, I presume.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; Even the surrounding town of Danville and the county of Hendricks,
here in</b>
<br><b>Indiana, have their little interesting quirks. Danville with it's
own haunted</b>
<br><b>train trestle which resembles a Roman aqueduct and Hendricks County
with it's</b>
<br><b>secret society of witches where an official investigator was "let
go" when he</b>
<br><b>got too close to the reason behind all the grave exhumations in
the 80's. And</b>
<br><b>let's not forget, as has been the case, Lizton where the town cemetery
is as</b>
<br><b>big as the current town itself. Back in the 1800's, when it was
known as</b>
<br><b>Elizabeth Town, a plague wiped out most of it's citizens. Hence
the oversized</b>
<br><b>cemetery (and the condensed name).</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; Anyway, back to my account. The student body was assembled
on the wooden</b>
<br><b>bleachers cheering with the overindulged cheerleaders here in the
gymnasium</b>
<br><b>which was built years previous with monies donated by the wealthiest
family</b>
<br><b>in town, the Bosticks, who left their home and grounds abandoned
to the town</b>
<br><b>for teenagers to, well, you get the idea; have some abandonment
of their</b>
<br><b>own?...in a manner of speaking, of course.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; Ok. Back, again, to the subject at hand. The school is conveniently</b>
<br><b>situated next to a cemetery which can easily be visualized through
the</b>
<br><b>gymnasium windows. On the south bleachers, where we were seated,
we, the 8th</b>
<br><b>graders, had a clear view. As the cheerleaders led us in some boring
diatribe</b>
<br><b>of victory my attention was drawn to a more interesting site than
pom-poms</b>
<br><b>and mini skirts. Ascending a small flight of stairs from the glass
exit doors</b>
<br><b>which led to the cemetery was a mist. That's the only way I can
describe it.</b>
<br><b>I believe it was a faded green and it was about 6 feet in height
and, maybe,</b>
<br><b>2-3 feet wide. It was the type of vision one would see after staring
too long</b>
<br><b>at a lightbulb then re-visualizing it on a blank wall. Kind of like,
"It's</b>
<br><b>not there if I look directly at it but is there if I just glance
in it's</b>
<br><b>direction." Well, the "mist" moved about 10 feet out onto the gym
floor and</b>
<br><b>stopped for a couple of minutes. I was still wondering when my eye's
would</b>
<br><b>adjust thereby causing this visual dysfunction to disappear when
my best</b>
<br><b>friend, sitting 2 rows down from me, tapped my foot and pointed
in the</b>
<br><b>direction of this thing. I thought that surely he couldn't see what
I was</b>
<br><b>seeing but his expression was so serious. Well, after spending several</b>
<br><b>minutes on the gym floor, presumably enjoying the floor show, it,
ever so</b>
<br><b>slowly, retreated to a section of bleachers to the right of the
stairwell</b>
<br><b>from whence it came and rose about four seats where it, over several
minutes,</b>
<br><b>dissipated. After the rally I met Walt on the way out of the gym
where, not</b>
<br><b>wanting to put words in his mouth, asked him what he was pointing
at. He</b>
<br><b>asked me, "Did you see that ghost?". I froze in my tracks.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; As far as I know, we were the only ones who saw this apparition.
I'll find</b>
<br><b>out for sure next year at our 20th reunion. After spending all my
grade</b>
<br><b>school years studying the paranormal and finally seeing "something"
it was a</b>
<br><b>nice little send off!</b><b></b>

<p><b>Permanent Residents</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: chibi_tsunami2787@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hi. My name is Andrika. I am 13 years old. I have always been interested
in the paranormal. The house that I currently live in has a permanent resident;
actually residents. This house isn't very old. It was built in 1983 on
the outskirts of Aurora, Colorado. My family and I have lived here since
1998. When I first saw the house, I got a sense that something was there.
Something that wasn't evil but not exactly good either. I talked to the
teenage kids who lived there before. One of the girls brought up the spirit
thing. She warned me that i should never sleep in this one room in the
basement. I asked her if i should know about any other spirits. She simply
replied with, "Don't worry. The other ones are quite nice." I've never
met the one down in the basement and honestly, i never want to. I have
met the other ones. They all "live" in different parts of the house. There
is a ghost in my room. I "met" her one night last summer. She had never
befo! re made herself known til that niir clothes are also slightly scorched
and they have burn marks on their bodies. I think they died in a fire.
They're actually in the computer room. I can hear them giggle and play.
They're very friendly and my brother (who's 10) has claimed that he's talked
to them. There are other things that have happened but I have to get off
the internet now. Thanks for reading!</b>

<p><b>Personal Ghost Stories</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: mtmlmk@lvcm.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>This happened when I was about 10.&nbsp; My sister is three years
younger than me.&nbsp; We lived in a mobile</b>
<br><b>home that my parents had bought from this middle aged couple.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The incidence only happened the one</b>
<br><b>time.</b>
<br><b>My sister had woken one morning absolutely terrified.&nbsp; She
said she had seen a ghost of a little</b>
<br><b>boy.&nbsp; She saw him at the end of my bed looking at me.&nbsp;
At the time we shared a room and had our twin</b>
<br><b>beds tied together so that our mother could sleep between us and
keep us from fighting.&nbsp; She said</b>
<br><b>she wasn't scared at the time and went right back to sleep.&nbsp;
Mom didn't believe her, and normally</b>
<br><b>neither did I.&nbsp; But this time she was genuinely freaked.</b>
<br><b>A few months later I saw him.&nbsp; I woke up in the dead of night
and sat straight up.&nbsp; I instinctively</b>
<br><b>looked over my mother towards my sisters bed.&nbsp; There at the
end of her bed was a big cloud of white</b>
<br><b>mist and in the center was the face of a small boy looking down
at her.&nbsp; It didn't move and didn't</b>
<br><b>seem to notice me.&nbsp; I was so calm, a feeling I recall to this
day.&nbsp; I just laid back down and went</b>
<br><b>right back to sleep.</b>
<br><b>The next morning I asked my sister if that was what he looked like.&nbsp;
She said yes.&nbsp; It was too</b>
<br><b>weird.&nbsp; Again mom didn't believe us.</b>
<br><b>Over time my sister's version of what happened changed to the point
where she either says that she</b>
<br><b>made it up, or it was a dream.&nbsp; But I think it really happened.&nbsp;
Maybe I'll try and find out if that</b>
<br><b>couple who my parents bought the house from lost a child or something.&nbsp;
The overwhelming sense of</b>
<br><b>peace was too real to have not really happened.</b>
<br><b>Thanks for letting me to share!</b>

<br><b>Pets</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: amydode@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I was reading about how pets can come back and visit after death
and I was</b>
<br><b>amazed to discover there is a section dedicated to this issue.&nbsp;
When I was</b>
<br><b>living in Germany as an exchange student for a year, my cat died.&nbsp;
She was my first</b>
<br><b>and only cat, whom I had had since I was 9 (I was 20 the year she
died).&nbsp; My</b>
<br><b>parent's did not tell me she died since I was already concerned
about her health (it</b>
<br><b>had dramatically declined since I went to college). But one morning
in early</b>
<br><b>Feb., I felt my cat sleeping where she always slept, behind my knees.&nbsp;
I felt the</b>
<br><b>heaviness and warmth of her fat little body.&nbsp; I felt safe,
comfortable and SO peaceful for</b>
<br><b>the first time since being so far away from my friends and family.&nbsp;
When it finally</b>
<br><b>occurred to me I was in Germany, I opened my eyes and, of course,
no Snowy to be</b>
<br><b>found.&nbsp; I found out a month later that she had died at the
beginning of Feb.&nbsp; It was</b>
<br><b>the most amazing feeling, knowing that even a cat could love me
so much, that she</b>
<br><b>would come to me after death.&nbsp; I have never shared that story
with anyone since I</b>
<br><b>didn't think it really was possible.&nbsp; Just want to say thanks
for pretty much</b>
<br><b>validating that it was indeed my cat with me in my bed 6000 miles
away from home.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Something Strange</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: MsAmcnPie@aol.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Hi!&nbsp; Very interesting site!&nbsp; Thanks for all of your hard
work!&nbsp; Funny that I</b>
<br><b>didn't think about this for a long time until I started reading
the stories</b>
<br><b>posted on your site.&nbsp; I have just been picking and choosing
stories with</b>
<br><b>interesting titles to read and one in particular made me think of
something</b>
<br><b>strange that happened to me a few years ago.</b>
<br><b>I lived in New Hampshire at the time in a brand new house which
we had lived</b>
<br><b>in for about a year and half I think.&nbsp; My first daughter was
just a baby</b>
<br><b>about that age.&nbsp; My husband was away on a business trip and
it was a holiday</b>
<br><b>weekend on a Saturday.&nbsp; I can't remember which holiday, just
that it was a</b>
<br><b>holiday and there were no neighbors that lived around me at home.&nbsp;
My</b>
<br><b>daughter was taking a nap in her bedroom and I had fallen asleep
in my</b>
<br><b>bedroom which was directly across from hers and toward the back
of the house.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;It was around 4:00 p.m.&nbsp; I was suddenly awakened from
a sound sleep by a</b>
<br><b>very LOUD pounding on my front door.&nbsp; The banging didn't stop
and it sounded</b>
<br><b>urgent.&nbsp; I got out of bed and went into my bathroom to brush
my hair (I have</b>
<br><b>no idea why, instinct, I guess).&nbsp; Just as I raised the brush
to my hair a</b>
<br><b>voice, clear as if someone were standing next to me said "DON'T
GO NEAR THE</b>
<br><b>DOOR!"&nbsp; Well, I was scared into reality then and decided to
look out of a</b>
<br><b>front window from the spare bedroom to see who was outside.&nbsp;
At the top of my</b>
<br><b>driveway were two men dressed in suits and ties and looking very</b>
<br><b>official-like.&nbsp; I don't recall either one of them carrying
anything (such as</b>
<br><b>Jehovah Witnesses carry briefcases is my point).&nbsp; I then ran
to the front</b>
<br><b>living room to look out my window there to see if I could see their
car and</b>
<br><b>there was none.&nbsp; From the very short time (10 or 12 seconds)
it took me to go</b>
<br><b>back to the other window, the men had simply vanished!&nbsp; I ran
outside and up</b>
<br><b>the driveway to see if I could see anyone and there was no one around!&nbsp;
It</b>
<br><b>was then that I realized that every single one of my surrounding
neighbors</b>
<br><b>had gone away for the weekend or the day.&nbsp; I quickly ran back
into the house</b>
<br><b>and locked my door.&nbsp; I frantically tried calling another neighbor
down the</b>
<br><b>street but got no answer.&nbsp; I then called her parents only to
be reminded that</b>
<br><b>they, too, had gone away for the weekend.&nbsp; I then called a
close girlfriend</b>
<br><b>to tell her this strange story.&nbsp; Something about the men all
dressed up in</b>
<br><b>suits unnerved me.&nbsp; I was amazed that I heard that voice tell
me to not go to</b>
<br><b>the door.</b>
<br><b>I will never forget this happened and feel in my heart that the
men were</b>
<br><b>somehow "not real" even though I can't explain it.&nbsp; Even when
I think about</b>
<br><b>it now, a good 6 years later, I can't help but wonder, whose voice
was that</b>
<br><b>in my head, and how could those men have disappeared into thin air
and what</b>
<br><b>were they doing pounding at my door?&nbsp; And I mean they were
POUNDING!</b>
<br><b>I know you have a lot more "legitimate" haunted stories but my question</b>
<br><b>(you're probably saying "FINALLY!") is this:&nbsp; Do you think
this was some sort</b>
<br><b>of supernatural encounter?&nbsp; I definitely do but I am not an
expert at all and</b>
<br><b>I was wondering if it had some kind of explanation and you have
heard of this</b>
<br><b>happening before?&nbsp; Nothing like this has happened since and
I hope nothing</b>
<br><b>like it ever does.&nbsp; I'm frightened all over again just bringing
it up now.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Well b4 I (the 14 yr was born) my mom told me that while she was
in bed once with my Dad she said something got on the bed(she felt the
bed go down) and crawl as close as it could to her.She didn't know what
it was and she didn't look cause she was afraid to so she tapped my Dad
and he turned on the lights and she felt the thing move off the bed and
heard the thud on the floor.</b>
<br><b>Then once she told me that my aunt spent the night with her and
she was in the upstairs bedroom and something crawled in the bed with her.I
do not know anything about it.</b>
<br><b>Once my mom was home with my little brother&nbsp; (he was like&nbsp;
1 or 2) and I was at school.She got a phone call and said hello hello and
it was a message sayin someone on your party line is tryin to call you
stay on the line and wait for them to answer or try you call again&nbsp;
and it hung up and by that time she heard a big thud upstairs like someone
had called the house number from the upstairs room.</b>
<br><b>She had these little dogs and they would constantly goto the stairs
and look up and down like someone was standing there and they knew it.</b>
<br><b>I've like 2 or 3 experiances but the last one freaked me out.My
friend had come over (this past october 2000) and we were in my room and
we were the only ones upstairs and we had the door locked and were listenign
to music.While listening she was looking at some papers and I heard the
door rattle.I paused the music and asked her if she heard the door rattle
and she didn't.She must have been looking cause after I turned the music
back on the door rattled and she jumped up and screamed the door handle
moved! I got up and hollered at it and got out of there and went downstairs
to tell my mom.She came up there with us and the papers we left on the
bed were now in the hall.</b>
<br><b>I was on the internet in my room upstairs one night and I had the
door locked and shut and while I was on Napster my computer and overhead
light turnes off.My cd player lights were still on and my fan was still
going.I scrreamed and hollered cause it was pitch blakc in my room except
for the lil' lights on the cd player and I finally got out and I asked
my mom if the lights went out and she said no.I told her to come up and
we had to flip the switch back up to turn the light on and also put the
computer button back in to get it back on.We then went ot my 10 yr old
brothers room to see if he heard me(he had his music loud so he didn't)
and we couldn't get in his room.The door seemed like it was locked but
my brother's door has never had a lock on it.We finally got in and asked
him and he said he didn't hear me.</b>
<br><b>It was about a month ago (Late April2001) and i was up in my room
and I was on Npster and sitting there putting lotion on my legs.I have
lotions and shower gel bottles on my cmputer desk but this one shower gel
bath and body works bottle was in front of my moniter.It has never been
opened or used and about that time I got an instant message the shower
gel bottle turns an angle and moves like 4 inches across the desk.Of course
it scared the licing heck outta' me and I go tell my brother.I finally
tell my mom in the morning and she said she was glad it wasn't her seeing
the bottle move. (this one scared me the most)</b>
<br><b>Me and My little brother had gotten home from school and I was checkin'
my email on the downstairs computer and I had the door shut till' ajar.My
lil brother comes in there and says the kitchen light just went off by
it self and of course we had to flip the switch up to turn the ligth back
on.</b>
<br><b>We hear creeks upstairs all the time.It sounds like somone walking.It's
like the thing comes once a month and you don't expect it.It catches you
offguard. We also have pictures of me(the 14 yr old) with ghosts prbs in
the pictures.I noticed it finally when something happened to me.I also
have dreams of what the thing might do next at the house.I don't kno what
it is but it shakes out family up every month it does do something.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Late Night Read</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: salem_______@hotmail.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Just last week, I think it was tuesday, I was laying in my bed reading
at night, and out of the corner of my eye, out that same window (the window
I saw the face out of),</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I saw this huge, very bright flash of light. In my mind, I
ruled out a car headlight reflection, because none of my windows face a
road. I know that no one was up this late, so it couldn't have been a porch
light. I didn't know what to make of it. On July 4th, my birthday, my family
and I went to the local fairgrounds to watch the fireworks, and we rode
in two vehicles (my Aunt Karen and 2 cousins in the van, and my mom, brother
and me in the car) . We had to stop, so Aunt Karen just kept driving home.
As she came up the hill directly beside and parallel to our house, she
yelled at her kids for not keeping the lights off because our bill had
been very high, and she had noticed that every single light in the house
was on. When she pulled in around our shed, blocking the view of the house,
something must have happened because when she came into our driveway, all
the lights were off. They then told us when we came home and I thought
nothing of it, because&amp;nen the red, then the regular. I was mad becasue
the lights costed 5 dollars. Then when Amanda went to brush her teeth,
she said she heard moaning coming from the other end of the house. I went
in the bathroom to see if she was making it up, and she wasn't. I thougt
to myself, no one was home, all the doors and windows were shut, andi sure
wasn't moaning. So we went to bed, freaked out. Amanda was scared and she
went home that next morning. That's everything I can think of. If you have
any advice, I'd love to hear it. Thank you much.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Things Under the Bed</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: sweetotown12@hotmail.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Hi, my name is Emily .&nbsp; I have a couple stories and things I would
like to share with you.&nbsp; I have seen the Shadowlands page many many
times and I especially like the parts about the ghosts and hauntings, so
here's my story......</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You May Think Thing's
Aren't Under Your Bed.........</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your parents Say Theres
Nothing To Be Afraid Of,</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Sometimes...........They're
Wrong.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About two or three years ago today,
I got my best friend Lucky.&nbsp; Lucky and I were playing a game of "Hide
&amp; Seek", and as I slid underneath my canopy bed, I hit something.&nbsp;
I said "Darn, that hurt!", I put my hand behind me to push something towards
the wall and I felt something was under there with me.&nbsp; So I turned
over and I saw somebody just about as tall as me who I have never seen
in my life. ( I am about 4'10").&nbsp; He was wearing raggidy clothes and
he looked as if he was a slave.&nbsp; He was black and dirty.&nbsp; He
had cuts all over him.&nbsp; He told me to get out.&nbsp; It was my room
but he says he was there first.&nbsp; On the land first at least.&nbsp;
I ran out from under the bed to the garage and told my dad.&nbsp; He came
back with me (my dad) and told me there was nothing under the bed and to
just forget about it.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; I also wanted to say that since around that time I could
start to tell something was going to happen before it did......especially
with things like commercials on t.v. and on the radio.&nbsp; I am open
to any questions, thankx,</b><b></b>

<br><b>Reuben the Ghost</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:galcoolest@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;My name is Alison.&nbsp; In 1992, while finishing up my second
year of law school, I moved into a “garden apartment” that was the former
basement of a 3 story Victorian in the heart of San Francisco.&nbsp; The
wife of the family who owned the home had lived there, on the upper floors,
for over 40 years (she, as a child, with her parents), and she and her
husband had recently re-habbed the basement area to create a small living
area, with a kitchen and sort of “bed cubby”, plus a bathroom, to make
extra income.&nbsp; The apartment opened up via sliding glass doors to
the back yard.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;As I was leaving an unhappy living situation elsewhere and
desparate for a quiet place to study, I signed a year-long lease even though
the apartment was small and dark, and the landlords were right upstairs.</b>
<br><b>The very first day I moved in, strange things started happening.&nbsp;
First, a stray cat, who happened to be black, kept yowling outside my window
from the patio, obviously hungry and wanting to be fed.&nbsp; He was a
very affectionate fellow, but I could not entice the cat to cross the threshold
into my dining area, though it would happily take food outside the door.&nbsp;
I thought this very odd, because it was quite cold and wet outside, but
if I tried physically to bring the cat into the apartment it panicked and
ran to the door screaming wildly to get out.&nbsp; Once outside it sat
right by the door.</b>
<br><b>The first night there, right after I had plugged my microwave in,
and turned to do something else, I heard a loud explosion:&nbsp; the oven
had shorted, even though it was off, and I thought, ok, the landlords had
installed faulty wiring.&nbsp; I’d tell them in the morning. And then I
went to organize the bathroom, but when I walked in it was now at least
25 degrees cooler than the rest of the apartment and there was a sickening,
sewer-like,&nbsp; “rotten-flesh” smell pervading the space.&nbsp; It was
really overwhelming, and I thought, oh great, the plumbing&nbsp; is faulty,
too ---&nbsp; another thing to mention in the morning.&nbsp; I was dog-tired
from moving, and without even opening any boxes, I went to bed.</b>
<br><b>In the middle of the night I suddenly woke up to the sound of what
sounded like rustling papers somewhere in the apartment.&nbsp; It was pitch
black, so I couldn’t see anything, but I was certain an animal (maybe the
cat? a rat?) had broken in and was rummaging through my school papers piled
in a far corner.&nbsp; I listened intently, but the sounds stopped after
a few minutes, and somehow I fell back asleep, too exhausted to be all
that concerned.</b>
<br><b>When I awoke in the morning, the chill and smell in the bathroom
had dissipated.&nbsp; I went to get coffee down the street.&nbsp; But when
I got back, the chill and smell were back, and I was astonished to notice
that two of my sealed packing boxes were open on the floor!&nbsp; And my
cutlery that was wrapped in the bottom of one was now laying at the top
of the box in a way quite unlike I had packed it.&nbsp; My intitial reaction
was to get angry, because I assumed one of my landlords had snuck in and
was rummaging through my stuff.&nbsp; I called them on the phone and asked
straight up why someone had come into my unit.&nbsp; The husband told me
they had done no such thing.&nbsp; Momentarily dismissing the weirdness
of the boxes and forgetting about the noises I had heard the night before,
I told him about the microwave and the bathroom problems, and he said he
would be right down.</b>
<br><b>The landlord seemed perplexed, but now that I think about it, frustrated,&nbsp;
when he saw the fried outlet because he claimed he had just installed it
and that he was an electrician by trade and had never seen such a thing.&nbsp;
And luckily the bathroom was still cold and smelling awful so he could
see what I meant, and he was very upset about that too, cursing the plumber
and insulation guys he had hired only days before to install the bathroom.&nbsp;
He left promising to fix the outlet and get the plumbers back over while
I was out at school that day.</b>
<br><b>When I got home at dinner time, the landlord saw me come in and
called me on the phone to say he had put in a new outlet in the kitchen
and that the plumber couldn’t find anything wrong with the bathroom but
that it was probably a flukey, backed-up line that had cleared itself.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
He offered to replace my microwave, as it had been ruined.&nbsp; Since
the smell and chill had gone away again, I forgot about everything else,
ate a take out dinner, fed the cat outside again, and settled in to study.&nbsp;
But the lights kept flickering on and off, all over the apartment, so distracted
and frustrated about what were clearly electrical problems the landlord
would have to fix, I finally went to bed.&nbsp; I had unpacked very little,
except I did put my favorite crystal vase on top of my empty bookcase to
get it out of harm’s way as I settled in.</b>
<br><b>I awoke in the middle of the night with a start, the second night
in a row, something I rarely did.&nbsp; I sat up in my bed just certain
I was not alone.&nbsp; It was the weirdest feeling:&nbsp; I was too terrified
to move over to the light switch just to see if I was, and at the same
time telling myself I was being ridiculous for being so paranoid for no
apparent reason.&nbsp;&nbsp; I lay back down and tried to calm down.&nbsp;
Then I felt it:&nbsp; there was an unmistakable pushing on my bed down
by my feet, as if a person had sat on the edge of the bed.&nbsp; I froze
and stopped breathing, I was so scared.&nbsp; And then it “got up”, I could
feel the weight released.&nbsp; After about twenty minutes, I dared to
feel my way over to the light switch.&nbsp; I flipped it on, and the first
thing I saw was that my vase was not on the bookcase where I left it, but
across the room on the kitchen table.&nbsp; I think it was at this very
moment that my denial evaporated and I KNEW I was not alone.&nbsp; I stayed
up all night, too afraid to turn off the light, go in the bathroom, or
do anything.</b>
<br><b>At the crack of dawn I called my boyfriend and told him everything
that had happened in the past two days and would he please come over right
away.&nbsp; He wanted to laugh it off, but he sensed my panic, and arrived
a half hour later.&nbsp; The coldness and smell were in the bathroom again,
and now he was the third person to witness this.&nbsp; He started to get
freaked out, too, and we discussed what I should do next.&nbsp; For some
unknown reason, I picked up the phone and called 411, and as foolish as
it sounds, I asked the directory assistance operator for any listing under
“paranormal”, and she found the Institute for the Paranormal in a nearby
city.&nbsp; I called them, at like 8:30 in the morning, and just spewed
out my tale and asked for help.</b>
<br><b>I have since learned that I was in touch with some of the country’s
most well-known and respected “ghost-busters” who are trained to recognize
real “hauntings” or poltergeist activity from the merely imagined, and
their first advice to me was to notify my landlords that I knew about “it”
because they already knew.&nbsp; I said, “Are you crazy!&nbsp; My landlady
upstairs is a big-wig in the City government and they are going to think
I am drunk, insane or worse!”&nbsp; The investigator lady on the phone
told me that she was absolutely certain that if this activity had happened
to me already, and they had lived there over 40 years, that they knew about
this phenomenon in their house.&nbsp; I needed to call them to talk.&nbsp;
So I did—I called upstairs and told the landlady I needed to talk to them
after work.&nbsp; She sounded almost as if she expected me to invite her
down for a drink or something.</b>
<br><b>Well, when she arrived at my door at about 6:00 later that day,
she was with her husband and daughter and carrying two candles and a statue
of the Virgin Mary!!&nbsp; She gave me a knowing smile as she came in and
placed the icon and candles on the table.&nbsp; Well, it all came out really
fast, it was the weirdest “mea culpa” I had ever heard:&nbsp; the place
was haunted by a ghost they called Reuben, who was a guy who had been killed
in the spot where the bathroom now was. A minor gangster in the 20’s, Reuben
had been cornered there by the cops, who had raided the house looking for
him and had shot him when he resisted arrest. His girlfriend, Alison, was
also killed in the crossfire.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Although Reuben had been quiet for a long time, he had been roaming the
house for years making his presence known, and the paranormal investigators
believe that my arrival, maybe even just because of my name, was a trigger
for the sudden increase in paranormal activity.&nbsp; All I know is that
I didn’t stay in that house another night, and was able to break my lease
under a very real California law that says a landlord must disclose ghosts
known to inhabit a property or a tenant has legal cause to void the lease.</b>
<br><b>Today I have a whole new awareness and respect for the realm of
the spirits, and doubt I would get so frightened the next time one crosses
my path, or I his.&nbsp;&nbsp; What I think my story teaches is that I
tried to find rational explanations for what was going on, even in the
face of clearly inexplicable activity, and not able to do so, I got scared
and immobilized.&nbsp; Now, having read extensively about these kinds of
experiences, I feel lucky to have to have witnessed it firsthand, and to
have been lucky enough to have happened upon the paranormal experts I did,
when I did, so I knew I wasn’t going crazy.&nbsp;&nbsp; The house became
an object of intense interest for the professionals, and my panicked call
to 411 gave them a fascinating, documented case.</b>
<br><b>The really funny thing is, I still bump into the landlady at City
Hall in Council meetings, and we just wink at each other, for we have a
shared understanding and acceptance of intriguing realities about which
no further exchange is really necessary.</b>

<p><b>SAVED BY A GHOST</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:hockey_queen99@hotmail.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp; When I was in grade 4 last year I went to my cottage on March
Break. My little sis and I Rebecca went exploring in the woods. When we
were I met my cousin Brian, my bro Mike and my older sis Emily. We went
exploring together. But there was a huge log blocking us so I hopped over
it. It was huge and I was so short back then. I did a faceplant. My bro
was behind me and he tripped over me. He weighs a lot and my face was pushed
in the snow. He got off of me and yelled at me.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I felt so alone so I ran away. I ran through the woods with
trees scraching me. I don't know how long I ran or in what derection. All
I knew was that I was mad. I was bleeding from trees scratching me. I was
pretty tired so I sat on a log to rest and get my thoughts together.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;When I looked around I realized that I was lost. I decided
to stay where I was. But after about 10 minutes I had to go to the bathroom!!!</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;So I jumped up and tried to find my way back to the cottage.
But I just went deeper and deeper into the forest. My legs ached. I looked
around and felt scared. What if a bear ate me?</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I finally decided to (hey I really had to go!) go in a bush.
Before I did anything I heard a ghostly voice call my name. I turned around
in every direction. Then I saw a marker! I followed it to a path and ran
to my cottage.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;I ran to the bathroom. I told my dad that I got lost. He said
I should be more careful. I didn't tell him about what got me back.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; To this day I still don'r know what I heard. But sometimes
when I walk in the forest I remember what happened.</b>

<br><b>Saying Goodbye</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Suzanne.Phillips@ccra-adrc.gc.ca</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>First of all I would like to say that I have never seen, heard or
felt a</b>
<br><b>ghostly spirit.&nbsp; But honestly, I think I would love too though,
a nice</b>
<br><b>ghost, not one of those angry ones.</b>
<br><b>Well to continue, my dad has always believed in ghosts and paranormal</b>
<br><b>activities.&nbsp; He as well as I, are drawn to these things.&nbsp;
Once my dad told</b>
<br><b>me of something that has happened in our new house.&nbsp; The house
was built by</b>
<br><b>us a few years ago, maybe 7 years ago and this happened about 4
years ago.</b>
<br><b>He was sleeping when all of a sudden he felt the bed nudge a bit,
and again.</b>
<br><b>He opened his eyes to see someone he knew.&nbsp; I'm not sure if
he could see</b>
<br><b>through him or not but it was a spirit.&nbsp; The person just stayed
there at the</b>
<br><b>foot of my dad's bed and waved I think.&nbsp; It disappeared.</b>
<br><b>The next morning my dad woke up and got a phone call.&nbsp; That
same person had</b>
<br><b>died that night at the same time he was visited by him.&nbsp; I
guess he just</b>
<br><b>came by the say goodbye.</b>
<br><b>I've been reading all of these stories and I am amazed at how many
people</b>
<br><b>has seen or felt a ghost before.&nbsp; Close to where I live, a
couple used to</b>
<br><b>live in this house.&nbsp; One day, the woman was missing.&nbsp;
The man had called the</b>
<br><b>cops and was finally charged 3 years later of murder.&nbsp; He had
killed,</b>
<br><b>chopped and burned her body.&nbsp; Neighbours recalled this foul
odor flotting in</b>
<br><b>the air.&nbsp; But everytime I pass by that house, which is every
single day, I</b>
<br><b>tell myself her spirit must still be in there..sad of not being

Carnton Mansion in Franklin, TN is set off at the back of a neighbor hood
in the middle of a HUGE open field.&nbsp; The battle took place in in that
field as the family watched from their house.&nbsp; After the fighting
had stopped, the people of the house cared for the wounded soldiers and
laid the bodies of the dead on their back porch.&nbsp; You can still see
the blood stains.&nbsp; They donated land for the dead and created a cemetary
right in back of their house attached to their family cemetary.&nbsp; At
night, you can hear the battle still going on... the soldiers cry out and
the cannon ball fly.&nbsp; The family ghosts stay mostly in the house or
on the porch... sometimes you can see them in the windows if you're lucky.&nbsp;
Now, this being said, since there's nothing else to dorning, we pick it
up and you can hear gunshots, whispering, music, and a weird tapping noise
that fades out after a few minutes.&nbsp; It's really cool.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Haunted Grounds?</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Jean.Carlos@UnitedWater.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I have read most of the stories, though not all. I too have had many</b>
<br><b>experiences with the</b>
<br><b>supernatural. Here is one: My brother and I were driving from Piermont
from</b>
<br><b>our aunt's house</b>
<br><b>back to New Jersey and decided to take a different way. We missed
the turn</b>
<br><b>we were supposed</b>
<br><b>to make and I decided to make a U-turn in a parking lot. I pulled
into the</b>
<br><b>lot and as I did, I</b>
<br><b>looked up at the building and I felt the most horrible sense of
evil. My</b>
<br><b>brother and I looked at each other and he said to me: "Get the hell
out of</b>
<br><b>here quick!" I peeled out of the lot and took off down the road.
The worst</b>
<br><b>thing was that I could sense something following us and getting
closer by</b>
<br><b>the second. I saw a church up ahead and all I could think to do
was to pull</b>
<br><b>into the lot. As soon as I crossed into the parking lot the feeling
of being</b>
<br><b>chased vanished.</b>
<br><b>We finally got home and told our friends that were there waiting
for us to</b>
<br><b>get home. Well, the one guy, Matt, wanted to take a look since he
was very</b>
<br><b>into the paranormal. But first he asked us, separately, what we
saw and</b>
<br><b>felt. The building was a church, but the symbols I saw on the windows
on the</b>
<br><b>tower were nothing I'd ever seen before. I also saw a cemetery to
the right</b>
<br><b>of the building. What I felt was a sense of something evil that
wanted my</b>
<br><b>brother and I. My brother also saw the same things, but he said
he felt</b>
<br><b>scared at first, but then he felt that whatever it was wanted help.
Matt</b>
<br><b>came to the conclusion that it was evil and since my brother is
a very</b>
<br><b>giving person and always wants to help those in need that the spirit
was</b>
<br><b>appealing to that side of his nature; I on the other hand sensed
that it was</b>
<br><b>up to no good and was protecting my brother from harm.</b>
<br><b>We went back to the church and I immediately felt the presence again
and</b>
<br><b>wanted to leave. Matt told me to turn the car around and just hang
on. He</b>
<br><b>got out of the car to look around with a couple other people. I
refused to</b>
<br><b>move or to let my brother out of the car. Now this is the really
strange</b>
<br><b>part, there was no cemetery next to the building and no strange
symbols on</b>
<br><b>the tower windows. I never looked into the history of that particular</b>
<br><b>church, but I do know that Piermont and the surrounding area have
a lot of</b>
<br><b>history as far as the Revolutionary War and Indian tribes. Since
then I have</b>
<br><b>driven past the place a few dozen times and never had that feeling
again. I</b>
<br><b>have no doubt in my mind that if I had not driven off and pulled
into that</b>
<br><b>other church's parking lot that something horrible would have happened
to my</b>
<br><b>brother.</b>
<br><b>I have some other stories, but I will send those another time. (Nothing
as</b>
<br><b>scary as this was to me though!)</b>
<br><b>Thanks for reading.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Soldiers Story</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: davecam2222@hotmail.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>I saw your site, read the stoires, I liked the one called "Uncle
Mike",</b>
<br><b>about the soldier in Vietnam who was protected by his uncle.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; I had a expericance similar to that.&nbsp; First off
a little back round here,</b>
<br><b>&nbsp; I served 66-68, various units, and during 68, I was Army
Rangers.</b>
<br><b>During My first tour, with the 82nd AB, I had a really good buddy
Keith, who</b>
<br><b>was killed, his body was never found.&nbsp; During my days in the
Rangers we</b>
<br><b>would do these things called LRRPS, Long Range Recon PAtrols, we
would have</b>
<br><b>2 to 4 or more men, sometimes had Nung Mercenaries, or ARVIN, basically
look</b>
<br><b>into things.&nbsp; While we had a 4 man team, 1 guy carried our
radio, and a few</b>
<br><b>days into the patrol, we were ambushed and caught in a crossfire,
2 of us</b>
<br><b>got away, the 2 men, 1 who had the radio were dead.&nbsp; The 2
of us, got the</b>
<br><b>hell out of the area ASAP.&nbsp; About 3 days after that, we were
supposed to get</b>
<br><b>to the LZ and make our trip home, we missed it, we tried for the
secondary</b>
<br><b>LZ, missed it, were were MIA.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now your probably wondering what has this got to do
with a ghost, while 5</b>
<br><b>weeks in the jungle, walking around hoping to god that we would
run into an</b>
<br><b>american patrol, but instead, a platoon of NVA regulars had to do,
we</b>
<br><b>couldn't run, they were too close, the two of us just laid there
and waited</b>
<br><b>until they were close enough so our shots would count, this firefight
killed</b>
<br><b>my pal, and shot me up real bad, I lost so much blood, I passed
out.&nbsp; When I</b>
<br><b>came to I was in the same place, my dead pal laying there, I knew
the NVA</b>
<br><b>went through our pockets and stripped us, my watch was gone, and
so were my</b>
<br><b>boots, and our weapons and what ever they could use.&nbsp; Now I
should be dead,</b>
<br><b>I was there for a 2 days before a patrol found me,&nbsp; during
that whole time,</b>
<br><b>I saw Keith, he watched me, didn't say nothing, just kind of hunkered
down.</b>
<br><b>I felt a strange feeling, while he was there I felt safe, like everything</b>
<br><b>was going to be ok.&nbsp; I wasn't spooked, like I said I felt really
safe.&nbsp; The</b>
<br><b>doctors said it was a God Damn Miracle I made it.&nbsp; When I went
home, I went</b>
<br><b>to Keith's Mother and fathers house, told them the story.&nbsp;
His mother and</b>
<br><b>father gave me this looked like she understood everything I said.</b>
<br><b>It was strange and I still don't know if it really happened, it
was that</b>
<br><b>strange.</b><b></b>

<br><b>Spirit Experiences</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: ddell@bellsouth.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>This is a very interesting site. I am 46 yeas old and had my first
experience when I was 12. My mother had passed away then and about 2 weeks
later I woke up and heard footsteps in my fathers room, which was across
from mine. I could hear them pacing back and forth, and the board squeaking
in front of my parents dresser when thr footsteps went to that part of
the room, After listening for about 10 m inutes I at first thought my dad
woke up and went to the bathroom. But since they kept on, I figured he
was sleep walking. I yelled out..."Dad, is that you?" But no one answered.
I yelled out a second time, but no answer. I decided to go in his room,
and as soon as I sat up at the side of the bed. the footsteps stopped.
I thought..Is my dad playing games on me? I walked in his room to see him
snoring away, sound asleep. I called out to him again but he was out completely.
I walked back to my room and instantly knew it was probably my mothers
spirit . I was really scared and as soon as I laid down the footsteps returned.
I felt paralyzed with fear. I was only 12 and thought, if it is my mother,
what if she comes in here, and she looks all decayed and ugly. I covered
the blankets over me and it must have been by the grace of God that I even
fell asleep. My biggest fear when I woke up was that my Dad wouldn't believe
me and would tell me I was dreaming or imagining&nbsp; everything. I knew
I heard what I did and I was totally awake. It turned out he did believe
me and that 2 days before he had a lamp on his dresser turn on. It woke
him up, he was going to get up and shut it off, but it turned off by itself.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
My next experience was when I was 22 years old. My best friend in nursing
school got killed in a car accident. I was afraid I would have an experience
similar to that when my mother died and asked her not to visit me. 5 years
later I decided I really wanted to hear from her, and asked for a sign
from her. A month later I had this knocking in the corner of my bathroom
upstairs next to my bedroom. I thought it was the pipes in the wall. Then
I had a 10 gallon fish tank with 4 angel fish in it. One day my sister
came over and we were going to go shopping, and I told her my marbled color
angel fish was gone. We looked all over the tank and on the floor, but
never found it. I had 2 cats and figured the fish must have jumped out
and one of the cats ate it. Exactly 7 days later I was walking down the
stairs and at the end of the stairs where my fish tank is, I saw the marbled
fish back in the tank swimming around. I now had 4 fish again. I called
my sister and told her...she couldn't believe it, since she had helped
me look for it a week ago. I went to the fish store and asked them if angel
fish could hide under gravel and the girl looked at me like I was crazy.
She said they only hide behind things.&nbsp; A month later I had come home
late from a party. I had to use the bathroom, so I used the one by the
front door. In the sink was about a quarter size pool of blood. It was
perfectly round with no other drops around. it was about 2 inches below
and to the left of the drain.&nbsp; I figured one of my cats maybe cut
themselves or had a bladder infection. {As gross as it sounds, I had one
cat that occasionally would urinate in the sink} however there would be
a stream not a round spot. I washed it down the sink, and went upstairs
to wash up nfor bed. When I got upstairs,[ there were 2 sinks] I went to
the sink I normally use...next to my bedroom. There again 2inches below
and to the left of the drain was an exact spot of blood quarter size. I
was startled at how wierd it seemed. I checked the cats and did not see
any blood on them. I again washed it away, and went to bed.&nbsp; I wish
now I had taken a sample of that blood to a lab or something&nbsp; to see
if it was real blood.&nbsp; A couple weeks later I had a friend over night
and we were getting ready to go out. There were 3 knocks in my bathroom
that were so loud it was as if some one was pounding with their fists as
hard as they could. It scared us to death!. My friend said what the h---
was that? I told her it was the pipes...She said Pipes! It sounded like
the house caving in. I said it always does that, because I was afraid she
would go home and since I never heard knocking like that I was too afraid
to be by myself that night. A few&nbsp; days later I was going to sleep
and could hear voices close to my bedroom. It sounded like it was coming
from outside. I lived in a condo, and figured it was the girl next door
outside with a friend. I got up to shut my window, since the voices were
keeping me from falling asleep. When I got up, my window was already shut.
It was never opened, and there was nobody outside. When I got back to bed
and almost asleep, I heard them again. I opened my eyes and listened. it
sounded like 2 people conversing softly, like they were having tea together.
It was comforting in a way. I could not make out any of the words, and
figured it must be coming from my neighbors. What seemed wierd though,
was I never heard my neighbor through the walls in the 7 years I lived
there.&nbsp; [ My cats would act funny also. There were days&nbsp; when
they would run up and down my stairs as if running after something and
looking up. I thought it was a fly or something but never saw one].When
I went to work the next day, I was telling some of my friends. My one friend
who was into parapsychology said to me "Debi, maybe it's the people from
the other side." I thought she meant my other neighbor, until she explained
to me she meant spirits. She asked me if I had asked anyone to visit me.
I almost forgot about&nbsp; asking my friend Louise from nursing school,
since that was about a month and a half ago. She said to me "After my parents
died years ago we always had this knocking in the same corner of our living
room....spirits always knock before they enter " she said. At that point
my eyes got big and I told her the knocking I was getting in the corner
of my bathroom ceiling every day.&nbsp; A few minutes later a lady who
overheard all of us talking in the cafeteria came over to me. She said
she wanted to talk to me in private, I thought she was going to scold me
for talking about wierd stuff at work. What she said was that she thought
what I had was a spiritual problem She said she had a daughter who for
some reason whenever came over to stay with her would have all kinds of
wierd things happen. She said once she came home from work and all her
burners were on with pots of water boiling, windows all open with air conditioning
on etc. She said she had a poltergeist and very bad forceful happenings.
I had jokingly said to my friends that we should have a seiance to talk
to the dead we knew. This lady warned me not to do that. She said just
like there are good people and bad people, so there are good and bad spirits.
She said when you invite someone to visit, you don't really know who will
come, and you open your doors to any or all spirits. She told me I needed
to get rid of them immediately. She told me to go home and open my window
upstairs, and after I hear the knocking to explain that whoever it was
they needed to leave. She said spirits often come because they think you
can help them. She told me to tell them that they frighten me and that
they need to leave. The window open was to allow their exit. She also told
me to burn a candle when I was doing this because spirits often leave an
odor when they leave. Well I got home and as usual, after about 5 minutes
the knocking started. I did as she told me, and the knocking got lighter
and lighter but then came back stronger and stronger. I repeated myself
and the knocking got lighter and lighter and eventually stopped.[I didn't
however burn candles or have an odor in the house.] I couldn't believe
it! I felt like the whole thing was like a movie. I couldn't brlieve this
was real and actually happening to me. The next day I was blowdrying my
hair and had my head turned to the side brushing my hair. I saw this 4
or 5 foot large black image go very fast past the doorway. I thought to
myself..if I look out this door and see black slime on the wall, I am moving
out of here.&nbsp; Well nothing was there but I was upset because I thoght
everything went out the window and everything was gone. I decided to call
a girl whose mother saw her dead husbands spirit now and then. I knew I
needed to talk to someone who has had this type of thing happen to them,because
most people who haven't experienced such a thing think you are crazy. My
father was one of them. He thought since I lived alone I was imagining
all this and thought I needed a psychiatrist. Anyway, I called that girl
and she said to ask my mother to help me. That she is my mother and she
would always protect me. She said also to be happy, that spirits live off
your energy.My fear, was probably feeding them. I again did as she said.
That night I felt something like a cat jump up on my waterbed and walk
across my legs. I figured it was my cat, but she was already asleep on
my bed. Then I saw a small white looking form, who I thought it was my
second cat. I called her name and stuck my hand down for her to play with
it. She was in the basement and there was no cat there. I went to work
the next day to tell my friend Carol { who could see spirits, and even
had a crystaln ball..She was taking classes to learn to see colors and
auras, etc.} She told me those were just animals and she hadthem jump on
her bed all the time. I told her what if King Kong or a lion decided to
come? I was not interested, in anything visiting me anymore. She tolod
me I needed to come to her sisters house who was living with her boyfriend
in a haunted house. She said they had been getting help because they had
an evil spirit they were dealing with.&nbsp; I went there and couldn't
believe how I felt when I walked in her kitchen. I could feel a force on
the outside of me. She said that was where all the energy was coming from.
We went into the living room to talk. We could hear dishes clanging in
her kitchen and see forms dashing about all over....it was a wild experience
for me. She told me just like we have guardian angels we all have guids
to help us. She told me to ask my guids to help me. Whatever it is you
want or don't want. I told her I didn't want to hear, see or feel anything
. She said to ask my guids that when I went to sleep. She said also to
imagine a blanket of white light completely covering me. White represented
good, and nothing could enter through that. I went home and thought those
requests I had of not hearing, seeing or feeling anythong and did the white
light , blanket thing too. I have not had a problem since then.&nbsp; I
couldn't believe how the air in my condo looked clearer. I had like a cloudy&nbsp;
film in there that I really didn't notice until it was gone and could see
the difference.&nbsp; One of my 3 sisters passed away 13 years ago. I would
like to ask her to come and give me a sign that she is around, but am afraid
to do it for fear I would have an experience as before? Do you recommend
I forget it, or is there a way to get a sign from those you love, and not
have evil spirits bombard you? I found the stories on your web site very
interesting. I never actually saw any real spirit appear....thank God....I
don't know if I could handle that. My story is pretty boring compared to
what others have had. I do believe however, that when people close to us
pass on, they can give us signs. Most people are so busy, they might not
even be aware of the signs around them. Nice talking with you. Debi Truesdelln&nbsp;&nbsp;
PS All the incidents took place in Michigan. I now am married with 2 children
and live in Florida......please let me know how or if I should try to reach
my sister Nina who is passed on.</b>

<br><b>Stick Indians</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: ladybug1137@home.com</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;</b><b></b>
<p><b>Not many people have heard of them. No one knows if they truley exsist,
but I believe they do. There are reports in the Colville reservation in
Washington State, but Colville Natives won't talk about it. I have never
personally encountered them...but family members have...and I don't believe
they would lie about such phenomena. Anyway. Stick Indians, so I have heard,
are extremely tall beings who do not speak in words, but in creaks, howls,
and whistles. They are only out at night in the woods of Colville, near
Disatell Pass. They live along creaks and streams and have been known to
steal fish from fisherman in the area...and people out in the open.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;My uncle and his wife's family were camping up in that particular
area one night...they had two tents. One for him and his wife, and another
for her parents. They were camped near a stream and were fishing all day.
That night they heard strange noises... whistles and wierd clicking noises...like
that of a human. My uncle stuck his head out of his tent to see what was
going on when he saw 4 or 5 extremely tall, and very thin creatures on
two legs,&nbsp; over by there fishnets signalling back and forth to eachother.
My uncle was terrified, but he quickly ran to his in-law's tent and asked
them what was going on. The father told him to lye down and shut up. That
they were Stick Indians and if they made too much noise they might be attacked.
He said no one had ever servived an encounter with them and to just be
still. As long as they didn't know they were there they would be fine.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;When my uncle came home he was so terrified. He still, to
this day, will not go near Disatell pass. If he goes fishing, he goes in
the morning and is home at least a couple hours before dark.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Story About Mary Jane</b><b></b>
<p><b>By:bandoodle23@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>My mom, aunt, cousin, and I were visiting my Grandpa's house. My
Grandpa has said that there was a sprit haunting the house, but he considered
her "nice" and didn't really tell us that much about, he only told us that
he sees her atleast once a month, and in October he said that she clanks
on the pipes every night, and that he hears her footsteps. Of course, like
almost all people these stories would scare people, especially people who
are spending the night over at that house. On the first night of staying
there, there was nothing bad, no noises, but i still couldn't sleep. In
the morning, my cousin, robby, and I had breakfast with all of our family,
they later went outside to work in the yard, so just robby and I was inside
the house, watching TV. We figured that nothing would happen in the daytime,
so we weren't afraid of being alone in the house. When lunch time came
around we went up to the 2nd level ( the house has 3 levels and a basement
) to make a sandwich, we were slapping on the jelly and Robby is still
in limbo, so we just let he be.</b>

<p><b>Bloody Mary Sighting?</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: lisad86l@netscape.net</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi my name is Lisa and I'm a high school student.
Anyway here's my story.</b>
<br><b>Recently a neighbor did my hair in her apartment. We live in the
same</b>
<br><b>apartment building except our apartment is on the second floor and
hers</b>
<br><b>is on the first floor. My sister, who had just got finished getting
her</b>
<br><b>hair done was still down there just to hang out. We were talking
to the</b>
<br><b>neighbor's kids who are younger than both of us when suddenly we
got on</b>
<br><b>the topic of ghosts and demons. My sister brought up Bloody Mary
and I</b>
<br><b>told her that I heard if you said her name three time in front of
a</b>
<br><b>mirror in a dark room that you'll see her. Then I warned her not
to do</b>
<br><b>it because Bloody Mary is a bad ghost. My sister, being daring,
went</b>
<br><b>anyway to try it.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a few moments she ran out the dark room
she'd tried it in. She</b>

<br><b>Bass Fishing</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: MKovalick@fvp.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the first time
here for me. This is a wonderful site and I</b>
<br><b>would like to share my story with you.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was about 10 years
ago when an elderly neighbor told me of a</b>
<br><b>great place to go Bass fishing. His name was Eldred and he lived
in our</b>
<br><b>small town of Johnstown, Ohio his entire life. The lake, he stated,
was</b>
<br><b>owned by a friend of his. He told us to give his name if we were
questioned.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My two friends and I,
who were all about 18 years old at the time,</b>
<br><b>started our journey on foot to locate "Union Lake" to do some Bass
fishing.</b>
<br><b>We soon discovered that it was not easy to locate. There was a path
that</b>
<br><b>ended more than a quarter mile from the lake and the remainder of
the</b>
<br><b>journey was spent forcing our way through briar patches and weeds.
Still, we</b>
<br><b>were able to locate our destination.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We were absolutely amazed
when we arrived. The lake was</b>
<br><b>approximately 10 acres large, completely isolated and surrounded
by forest.</b>
<br><b>There wasn't a sign of any other human being ever being back there.
It was</b>
<br><b>forgotten by the world.&nbsp; We spent about three hours at the
lake and caught</b>
<br><b>some of the biggest fish we had ever caught. It was like fishing
at a</b>
<br><b>hatchery.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because of the
long walk back, we decided to leave about an hour</b>
<br><b>before sunset. As we were leaving we began talking of our experience
there.</b>
<br><b>We all spoke of a strange feeling. A chill in our spine. The hair</b>
<br><b>occasionally standing on the backs of our necks.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we reached
the crest of a hill overlooking the lake on our way</b>
<br><b>out of the forest I became overtaken with a sense of complete terror.
Never</b>
<br><b>in my life had I been that petrified. I felt as if I were surrounded
by</b>
<br><b>something and that my life was in danger. It was seconds later that
we all</b>
<br><b>witnessed the apparition.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can still see
it as clear as day in my mind. It has forever</b>
<br><b>painted it's picture in my head. It was a male figure, but only
from the</b>
<br><b>waist up. You couldn't see anything below the waist. It hovered
two to three</b>
<br><b>feet from the ground. I first noticed it when it was approximately
fifteen</b>
<br><b>feet to the left of us. It hovered directly in front of us and passed
on the</b>
<br><b>right. It looked straight ahead, swinging it's arms as if it were
walking.</b>
<br><b>When it was directly in front of us it turned and looked directly
at us. It</b>
<br><b>almost seemed to dissipate as it hovered off to the right. I can
still</b>
<br><b>remember the face. It looked empty, with no emotion yet it filled
the entire</b>
<br><b>area with a sense of dread.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides screaming
and crying like a bunch of little girls, we said</b>
<br><b>nothing until we got back to my house. We were too busy running
home. I</b>
<br><b>don't think I've ever run that fast in my life!</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The experience
seemed to consume our lives for about the next year.</b>
<br><b>Being young males full of testosterone, we made several trips back
trying to</b>
<br><b>re-live the experience. We had numerous "out of the ordinary" encounters</b>
<br><b>every time we went back. None of them pleasant and all in the presence
of</b>
<br><b>other people. None of us have, or ever will, go there alone.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have witnessed
strange balls of light flying over the lake, a</b>
<br><b>haze that has engulfed the lake leaving visibility at around 1 foot,</b>
<br><b>countless exotic animal sightings (running through the woods or
drinking</b>
<br><b>from the lake) and of course a sense of terror that can come on
as quick as</b>
<br><b>you can breath.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After some research
my friends and I discovered there has been two</b>
<br><b>drownings in this lake. Both before 1960. They were teenage boys
who had</b>
<br><b>fallen through the ice while ice-skating one winter.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am now
27 years old and have not been back to the lake for about</b>
<br><b>seven years. Although you might think a lake like this would become
a</b>
<br><b>popular hangout for teens because of the stories, it hasn't. I have
younger</b>
<br><b>siblings still in the area who said because of the vegetation growth
and</b>
<br><b>long path that is only accessible by foot, it is once again forgotten.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not by me.</b><b></b>

<p><b>The Other Side</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Pjmc469@cs.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>I am not sure if I would call most of my experiences with "the other
side" as</b>
<br><b>ghost stories. I have always had a way of sensing when something
is going to</b>
<br><b>happen, I have dreams that sometimes will have scene in them that
will come</b>
<br><b>true the next day, I also have seen spirits and I can sense the
presence of</b>
<br><b>spirits, for as long as I can remember. My sister has also had experiences</b>
<br><b>with ghosts.</b>
<br><b>I was reading several of the stories posted on The Shadowlands and
some of</b>
<br><b>them struck a nerve. I found the one describing animal spirits interesting.
I</b>
<br><b>had a dog from the time I was 3 until He was put to sleep when I
was 21. Let</b>
<br><b>me assure you all that he was very sick and he had held on to life
for such a</b>
<br><b>long time that he deserved peace. He was blind, he had to have most
of his</b>
<br><b>teeth pulled, he could hardly walk and he had to be carried outside
to use</b>
<br><b>the bathroom. I had married and moved to Michigan a couple years
before he</b>
<br><b>had to be put down. I was devastated when my parents told me that
he was put</b>
<br><b>down, but I understood. Not long after his death I saw him in my
front yard</b>
<br><b>he stoped and looked at me and walked the other way. I went outside
to see</b>
<br><b>him and he was gone. I know it was him coming to say good-by.</b>
<br><b>What is striking about this story is the connection to the next
story I want</b>
<br><b>to tell you. When my family and I were getting ready to move to
Michigan I</b>
<br><b>remember telling my husband that I didn't want to leave because
my dog and my</b>
<br><b>grandpa were going to die after I leave.</b>
<br><b>My grandfather did pass away while I was in Michigan. After he died,
and</b>
<br><b>again this was a death after a sickness, It was time. My grand father
was a</b>
<br><b>proud man. He was a wonderful man and loved his family very much.
I could not</b>
<br><b>go to his funeral and I felt very guilty. I started to find dimes
around my</b>
<br><b>house, now this is not weird, but I would pick up the dime and put
it away</b>
<br><b>(small kids around) then a few minutes later the dime would be back.
I would</b>
<br><b>put it away and think, "what is the deal with dimes!" this has occurred
in</b>
<br><b>every house I have lived in since. I did not put it together for
quite a</b>
<br><b>while, until my Mom and I were talking. I was saying how poor my
husband and</b>
<br><b>I were while living in Michigan and that the little bits of money
they sent</b>
<br><b>to us really helped, I called it "mail box money" because someone,
parents,</b>
<br><b>grandparents, would always seem to send money just when we needed
it most. My</b>
<br><b>Mom told me that grandpa used to send them money too when she and
my dad were</b>
<br><b>young. I told my Mom about the dimes and she said that it sounded
just like</b>
<br><b>something my grandpa would do. So, shortly after, I went to my room
and asked</b>
<br><b>grandpa to leave me a dime if it was him and sure enough, there
was a dime on</b>
<br><b>the floor the next time I went into my room. I have since tried
to tune in to</b>
<br><b>the spirits and not ignore them, I find that if I am quiet and do
not let my</b>
<br><b>mind get overloaded with "stuff" I can sense the presence of grandpa,</b>
<br><b>grandma (his wife) and my maternal grandpa who has recently passed.
The</b>
<br><b>visits are fewer lately but I know when they are here.</b>
<br><b>I have also experienced a black figure, grim reaper type, over me
in bed.</b>
<br><b>There was an evil, or bad spirit in a house we rented, and I am
sure my</b>
<br><b>husbands uncle, who died in a fire, has visited.</b>
<br><b>These are all true, and I believe in ghosts, angles, and spirits.
I think it</b>
<br><b>is a comfort to know that someone I love still checks in on me.</b><b></b>

<p><b>Wierd electrical problems, or Ghosts? I don't know</b>
<br><b>My whole life i have been surrounded by my dads stories of the supernatural.</b>
<br><b>These stories involve his aunt and his childhood.&nbsp; Ever since
i can remember</b>
<br><b>i have loved everything about ghosts, i am fascinated by all the
stories on</b>
<br><b>your site, but i might have my own to tell.&nbsp; This has been
wierd for me, my</b>
<br><b>house is usually perfectly normal, but recently i have had odd experiences.</b>
<br><b>Yesterday, while i was cleaning the house, i had the radio blasting
like</b>
<br><b>normal.&nbsp; I can't clean the house without the radio, but i had
just finished</b>
<br><b>vacuuming and i heard my station fade out and the radio was changing
to a</b>
<br><b>different station, i heard static, then totally different music.&nbsp;
I went out</b>
<br><b>to see what was wrong and i saw the tuner had moved, and i don't
know how.</b>
<br><b>Another happened today when i woke up from my nap.&nbsp; I got up
to turn my fan</b>
<br><b>off and put it down on the floor, just then my tv turned on by itself,
now my</b>
<br><b>tv is known to do that when the power goes off and comes back on,

<p><b>i was 11 years old at the time this happened. i was having a dream
one night</b>
<br><b>that this gentleman was giving me piggyback rides. we were laughing
and</b>
<br><b>having a wonderful time. in my dream he was wearing a brown suit
and a</b>

<p><b>&nbsp; Strange Figure</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: Ultima1086@aol.com</b>
<br><b></b>&nbsp;<b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hi, I am Chris and am 14 right now. I live in
Portland Oregon and I will</b>
<br><b>tell you about the strange ghostly experiences that I have had in
my previous</b>
<br><b>house about 4 years ago.&nbsp; One story that I could remember very
clearly is</b>
<br><b>this. My family and me had a camp out in the living room with the
tent and</b>
<br><b>everything. We had the T.V. on so we could watch it during the night
when we</b>
<br><b>go to bed. It was on a Saturday at about 11:30 PM when I went to
bed. My dad</b>
<br><b>stayed up though and continued to watch T.V. He had a can of beer
out and</b>
<br><b>drank it that night. The next morning when my dad got up to make
breakfast,</b>
<br><b>he couldn't find the can to throw away. So, he went up to the coffee
table he</b>
<br><b>set it on and found it ripped in two under the coffee table. It
had a clean</b>
<br><b>slice to it. It had no trace of dog marks on it since my dogs severely
chew</b>
<br><b>things up and it had no teeth marks. It was perfectly round still
just in 2</b>
<br><b>pieces.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another incident was
conincidentally, I always slept walk, I never</b>
<br><b>knew I did, but my parents saw me alot. Sometimes I went downstairs
and I was</b>
<br><b>screaming. I woke up my parents and I was crying. My parents asked
me "why?"</b>
<br><b>but I didn't answer, I just cried and screamed and eventually stopped
and</b>
<br><b>went up to bed like nothing happened. I sometimes walked downstairs
and</b>
<br><b>noticed myself watching the T.V. But I went to bed upstairs and
my parents</b>
<br><b>always made sure that I was tucked in upstairs, so I thoght that
it was quite</b>
<br><b>odd that I sat upright on the couch and I found myself that I had
turned on</b>
<br><b>the T.V. watching some weird show, so I turned it off and thought
nothing of</b>
<br><b>it.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes, since we had alot of magnets on the
refrigerator, they shot</b>
<br><b>out from underneath the fridge and sliverwear fell off of the counters
even</b>
<br><b>when they were definitely on the counter not close to an edge. We
had chairs</b>
<br><b>that rocked, paper get shredded, and other weird incidents.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The weirdest one is just finding myself afraid
of the stairs going to my</b>
<br><b>bedroom. When you first enter the kitchen, you go to the end of
it, then</b>
<br><b>there is a door in front of you and a door to your right, the one
to the</b>
<br><b>right is the upstairs room....When you enter it, it turns immediately
up</b>
<br><b>narrow small stairs and above the first stair is a balcony that
looks over</b>
<br><b>the backyard which connects the attic with the other dark attic.
I don't know</b>
<br><b>whether I saw something there when I was littler, but I was terrified
of it.</b>
<br><b>I would refuse to go up the stairs alone and would not go up even
if I had a</b>
<br><b>dog right by me looking one way as I looked up. It felt as if something
was</b>
<br><b>watching you when you were going up all the way to my bedroom, which
you</b>
<br><b>could still see onto my bed from the balcony. I always got chills
and I heard</b>
<br><b>sounds all of the time. Sometimes, I even just have a feeling that
it is</b>
<br><b>there next to me and is going to get me. I have on some occasions
jump down</b>
<br><b>my whole flieght of stairs, not touching one stair and landing painfully
on</b>
<br><b>the linollium floor. It gets you even more frightened too since
you jump so</b>
<br><b>far you could touch the balcony if you wanted if you jumped like
that , I</b>
<br><b>don't know if I had a demon, or dark soul there, because I always
just missed</b>
<br><b>the soul and saw dark figures just pass the balcony to the "Dark
Attic". I</b>
<br><b>don't know if it was exorcist or some being of evil or something,
but it</b>
<br><b>scares me to death now and I never would want to feel that again
since I have</b>
<br><b>dealt with that "starring" feeling from the balcony for 12 years.
I want to</b>
<br><b>wonder if anyone else has had that feeling and if anyone knows if
it is bad</b>
<br><b>or good?</b><b></b>

one night when i had a dream that i was walking by the cemetary on the
way to the store, in my dream thier was this man walking toward me, as
we approached each other we stop to talk, we both said hi to each other
he asked where i was going, and i told him i was going to the store, he
then said goodby and i said goodby, as we walked away from each other,
i had this funny feeling to say more and turned around to call him. He
was no where in sight, at the time there was no other people on that long
block but us, i had only taken about four steps before turning around.
three days later i was walking down the same sidewalk when i saw this man
in my dreams, i knew instantly what was going to be said by both of us,
to the point that it scared me badly. never the less we talked and said
goodby, i took my four steps turned around and he was gone. i'm 66 years

<p><b>Strange Occurance in Iowa</b><b></b>

<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>Hello,&nbsp; a bunch of my friends and I had gone out past Dixon
to basically</b>
<br><b>relax and have fun over at a friend's farm.&nbsp; His idea was to
take us across</b>
<br><b>these fields, through woods and a crick and a cornfield, to this
old empty</b>
<br><b>house just hidden amongst the trees of this area.&nbsp; They've
reported seeing</b>
<br><b>strange things, none of which occurred or were not explainable when
I</b>
<br><b>witnessed them.&nbsp; For the most part, they were simple sounds
that could have</b>
<br><b>been causes by animals or whatever life there lived in these woods.&nbsp;
But</b>
<br><b>something strange did occur that I couldn't understand.&nbsp; My
friends reported</b>
<br><b>that when they woudl come out to the house in the past, once they
would come</b>
<br><b>into the yard of the house, their flashlights would immediately
stop working.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;All the flashlights would.&nbsp; That didn't happen in our
case.&nbsp; But once we</b>
<br><b>stepped into the yard, we could see our breath.&nbsp; It wasn't
cold, and this was</b>
<br><b>the instance during our walk when there was no fog covering the
ground, yet</b>
<br><b>we could still see our breathes, and it was almost as if someone
was watching</b>
<br><b>us.&nbsp; I believe I have seen many ghosts before, perhaps it is
an ability only</b>
<br><b>some people have, or at least know how to use it properly, but nevertheless,</b>
<br><b>I could see my breathe as if the temperature had changed a good
35 degrees</b>
<br><b>once we crossed into his yard.&nbsp; The house, I'm sure, is somewhere
along city</b>

<br><b>Sugar the Apparition</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: liketositonporch@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>Sugar was a dog (small poodle to be exact).&nbsp; He was</b>
<br><b>born 11/11/77.&nbsp; He was given to me for my b-day, but</b>
<br><b>he was really my dad's.&nbsp; Dad took him to work everyday</b>
<br><b>(my dad even works on holidays).&nbsp; Every morning at 9am</b>
<br><b>Sugar would bark at my dad to go to work, at noon</b>
<br><b>barked for lunch (mom made Sugar a 1/2 sandwich, 4pm</b>
<br><b>was tea (and cookies) and 5pm barked to go home (real</b>
<br><b>9-5 dog).&nbsp; 7pm was dinner and would situate himself in</b>
<br><b>front of the kitchen entrance and after dinner Sugar</b>
<br><b>and my dad would head down to the finished basement to</b>
<br><b>watch TV and smoke.</b>
<br><b>As Sugar got older he lost his sight, hearing and</b>
<br><b>teeth.&nbsp; He still went to work, ate his food with</b>
<br><b>relish, learned to count stairs and know where</b>
<br><b>everything was (no re-decorating).</b>
<br><b>One day while at work, Sugar got disoriented went out</b>
<br><b>on to the fire escape and fell 2 stories.&nbsp; He lived,</b>
<br><b>but with complications.&nbsp; He died a week later.&nbsp; I was</b>
<br><b>not living with my parents at the time, but went over</b>
<br><b>quite a lot (I lived 3 miles from them).</b>
<br><b>While I was over for dinner on several occasions I</b>
<br><b>would see Sugar at his usual spot in front of the</b>
<br><b>kitchen and I went to the basement one afternoon to</b>
<br><b>get something and Sugar was walking around.&nbsp; Another</b>
<br><b>time I went to say good-bye to my dad before going</b>
<br><b>home and I saw Sugar at my dad's feet (at the end of</b>
<br><b>the couch).&nbsp; I told my dad that I see him, he told me</b>
<br><b>he felt him next to him earlier (Sugar would snuggle</b>
<br><b>next to my dad, then as the basement warmed [space</b>
<br><b>heater] he would move down to his feet).</b>
<br><b>I would say if I saw him, but no one ever saw him (my</b>
<br><b>dad saw him once, but would feel him like a small dog</b>
<br><b>next to him).&nbsp; My mom was jealous to not see him or</b>
<br><b>feel him.&nbsp; She would look but he never appeared to</b>
<br><b>her.</b>
<br><b>This went on for less then a year.&nbsp; My dad and I have</b>
<br><b>theory that everything has energy and depending on how</b>
<br><b>strong your energy is when you die your form can still</b>
<br><b>be present.&nbsp; Sugar was very strong willed.</b>

<p><b>The Accursed Stone</b><b></b>
<p><b>By: duirwydd77@yahoo.com</b><b></b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My story may sound cheesy, but every word is more</b>
<br><b>true than any ever spoken. It begins 7 years ago, when</b>
<br><b>I was 13 and in the 7th grade. It was Christmas break,</b>
<br><b>and my family and I had planned a vacation to sunny</b>
<br><b>Mexico to escape the bitter cold of the SF bay area's</b>
<br><b>winter. The first few days of the vacation went well,</b>
<br><b>aside from some mild insomnia on my part (it was a bit</b>
<br><b>hotter than I was expecting, and that interfered with</b>
<br><b>my sleep). On day 3, the weather had cooled off a bit,</b>
<br><b>and I was finally able to get a good night's sleep.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next day we went to the beach. I've always</b>
<br><b>loved swimming, and took to the ocean the second I hit</b>
<br><b>the sand. After playing about in the water awhile, I</b>
<br><b>stubbed my toe on something. The sand at this beach</b>
<br><b>was particularly smooth, so a rock seemed</b>
<br><b>out-of-place. I dove under and grabbed it. It looked</b>
<br><b>like a piece of green stone tile. I decided to take it</b>
<br><b>back home as a curiousity. That night strange things</b>
<br><b>started to happen.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First off, there was the sound of a horse riding</b>
<br><b>full gallop back and fourth on the walkway outside my</b>
<br><b>window. I was on the 11th floor of a hotel; how did a</b>
<br><b>horse get up there? I got up to investigate and, of</b>
<br><b>course, found nothing. Until I turned around, that is.</b>
<br><b>There, standing in my doorway, was a hooded cloak. No</b>
<br><b>person in the cloak, just a cloak. I should mention</b>
<br><b>that the invisible horse never stopped galloping back</b>
<br><b>and forth outside my window, even when I looked out.</b>
<br><b>As I stood there, on the verge of pissing myself, the</b>
<br><b>cloak turned around and floated away. Needless to say</b>
<br><b>I didn't get much sleep that night.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the story doesn't end there. After that</b>
<br><b>vacation I went home, not making the connection</b>
<br><b>between the stone and my cowled intruder. I kept the</b>
<br><b>stone with me. That new years eve, I had a couple</b>
<br><b>friends spend the night. They were on a fold-out couch</b>
<br><b>bed in my living room, and I was getting ready for bed</b>
<br><b>in my room. Something brushed past my leg. Now I own 3</b>
<br><b>cats and a dog, but I distinctly remember putting them</b>
<br><b>all outside for the evening, so this kinda scared me.</b>
<br><b>I grabbed my pentacle off my desk (Yes, pentacle. I'm</b>
<br><b>a life-long practising Celtic Pagan) and ran back to</b>
<br><b>the living room. Then weird stuff started happening</b>
<br><b>again.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First off there was the painting my mother did.
It</b>
<br><b>shows her in her younger years on a swing, with my</b>
<br><b>grandmother holding the rope that holds the swing. The</b>
<br><b>smile on my grandmother's face started getting bigger,</b>
<br><b>and for lack of a better term, more evil. I brought</b>
<br><b>the pentagram to bear on the painting, as if I was</b>
<br><b>holding a firearm, when who should float out of the</b>
<br><b>painting and towards me and my friends but my old</b>
<br><b>friend from Mexico, the cloak. Channeling all the</b>
<br><b>energy I could from the house, my friends, and</b>
<br><b>everything else conceiveable, I drove the spirit from</b>
<br><b>my house.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next week, I figured out what was causing
all</b>
<br><b>this: The Stone. I broke it in half and gave the</b>
<br><b>larger half to a close friend of mine and fellow</b>
<br><b>pagan. I ended up losing my half. My friend kept his.</b>
<br><b>He is now in jail for posession of LSD and</b>
<br><b>Methamphetamine, attempted murder, and assault and</b>
<br><b>battery. Formerly a straight-A student, his life</b>
<br><b>started going downhill the day I gave him that evil,</b>
<br><b>accursed stone.</b>
