<span style="font-weight: bold;">My cousin Sandy was in the hospice
ward at the hospital.&nbsp; I went to see her one last time, just to
tell her I loved her.&nbsp;&nbsp; She was in a comma and they said
(husband and sister-in-law)she didn&#8217;t know I was there but she said my
name when I spoke to her.&nbsp; I sat and talked to her and held her
hand and told her good bye.&nbsp;&nbsp; I left the room and started out
of the hospital got all the way to the lobby and my cell phone
rang.&nbsp; I answered it and no one was there but when I looked to see
who called me I had to find a seat.&nbsp; It was Sandra&#8217;s home
phone.&nbsp; No one was there.&nbsp; Her husband was up stairs in her
room.&nbsp; She had no one else living in the house.&nbsp; Not a scary
spooky story but an unexplained <br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Williamson Trade School PA Experience</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">By:&nbsp; cantkillrooster@yahoo.com </span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">I had a free day and decided to
explore the woods, behind&nbsp; my house, its leads to some of the
trade school property but mostly township property that has large gas
lines you can follow. I use to hunt and fish, but never was a trapper,
so i thought it would be okay to do some tracking as long as i stay off
the Trade schools property. As i was tracking i found fresh dropings
and prints, i was sure i was drawing near a large dear. Spending time
to breathe the fresh dewy air, grab a drink of water and stoping to
view my surrounding, i soon realized i was the one being watch. A large
6 point buck, with redish golden hair, a beatiful creatre almost like a
stag you see in fantasy movies, it was unheard of. So i follow this
buck that lead me to the abandon station near williamson trade school,
I continued to follow it to the closed station. K, heres the where the
weird an erie begin, when i got on the tracks this buck (that was no
more then 20 yards), took one last jump off the track and vanished in
mid air. I couldnt belive it, no noise of it running, and no tracks to
be found. So big deal, I lost the game i was tracking, so i continued
on to look at this abondon train station, i said out lowd, "Is any one
inside, im passing through and just taking a look." A few seconds
later, i heard a hard bang on the plywood that was blocking all the
windows and door, like a palm slapping it. Mkay, whatever must be a
animal in there, so i decided to walk the tracks for a bit. Looking at
the old light from the station noticing everthing disconnected. Any
way, had enough of walking on the tracks decided to turn around and
head back, as i looked up so not to trip on the tracks to my disbelief
some of the station lights where on and sure enough that dear was
watching me on the tracks. Im a pretty fearless and courages type i
started run back to the station, in a flash the lights turned off and
the buck vanished again!Now whats really increadible, is when back
tracked, the hoof prints and dropings where gone.Please if you can tell
about some other people experiences there, i would be very interested
to hear. If so i plan on doing more investigating.Thank you for your
time and hope this was helpful</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">

<span style="font-weight: bold;">I am always suprised to see my town
left out of everything! From ancient Indians to early white settlers,
our town has it all. I was born and raised in NJ. I have always had an
interest in ghosts and things of a spiritual nature, but it was not
until I lived in this town, Cardiff, a small section of Whiteford that
I began to believe in ghosts. I have experienced things frequently in
my home, but it is my next door neighbors house that is without a
doubt, haunted. I am uncomfortable just walking in the door. Whereas my
house has more of a benevolent feeling, my neighbors next door and two
other houses within my block are not so lucky. Many people have
witnessed events at this house and several others on my street.
Undeniable experiences. It would be great if someone took the time to
look into this area. One would not be disappointed. I have also found
indian artifacts on my property so I am not sure exactly what we have,
but we most definitely are not alone out here in the country....<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Weird Happening at Manjimup</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
jillwozhere@yahoo.com.au</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">I thought I'd just share with you a
short, but strange happening as reported to me from my daughter, who
called in last night on her way home from a weekend stay with her
in-laws.&nbsp; My daughter's parents in law have just recently taken on
a job as caretakers at the golf club in the small town of Manjimup,
Western Australia.&nbsp; They are very family orientated and as they
have moved a few hours drive away from their children, they encourage
them to come and stay for a night or two.&nbsp; Both my daughter, her
husband and kids and on separate occasions, my youngest son, who is
dating my son in law's cousin, have stayed there previously without
incident, but last Saturday 29th of July, was different... Below is the
story as related to me:&nbsp; Earlier in the evening my daughter and
husband had put the children to bed (two sons 3 and 5 and a daughter 10
months). Some time after they had tucked them in, but not yet gone to
bed themselves, their eldest son, Steven, came in, frightened and
telling his mum of a scary shadow in his room.&nbsp; My daughter calmly
reassured him about how sleeping in new places can make you a bit
nervous, but there was nothing to worry about and tucked him safely
back into bed feeling better knowing Mum was disconcerned.&nbsp; She
thought nothing more of it.&nbsp; Later however, she and hubby had
retired for the night and gone to sleep, when my daughter awoke to
hearing creaking floor boards as if someone were walking around the
room.&nbsp; She assumed it was her sons and called out their names,
asking why they were up and beaconing them to come to her reassuringly
in case they were feeling spooked again, but although the creaks
continued and it definitely sounded like someone was there, no one
answered her.&nbsp; By this time she was sitting up in bed and her
husband had been roused by her calling out to the children.&nbsp; As he
was enquiring sleepily about what was going on she saw a shadowy
figure, about the size of her oldest son, beside her bed. In the
darkness she thought it was Steven and reached out her hand to him, but
her hand just went through the shadow and she realized no one was
there!&nbsp; At this point, she got up and turned on the light, to find
no one in the room.&nbsp; Her husband went to check on the children and
found them all peacefully sleeping.&nbsp; In the morning she asked
Steven about the shadow that had worried him and he described it just
as my daughter had seen it. Like that of a child about the same height
as himself. I did look on the net for any other similar experiences at
that golf club, but have not found any, but you have to admit... it was
a bit weird!</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">

Iowa Catholic Church Hauntings</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
jordyntimmerman5@gmail.com</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">I'll start with the walnut Iowa
Econolodge experiences. Was working11-7 shift on a night when the hotel
was pretty dead (only two rooms booked on upper floor) there were
locked doors in what is known to employees as the queen hallway opening
and closing in unused, locked rooms. Former and current employees
believe this is the spirit of a man who was shot when the location was
a bar. Also employees that have been here for a couple of years said
they have found unused rooms In that same hallway messy as though the
rooms had been occupied. The earling Iowa catholic church: had recently
moved to the town and was on my morning walk when I ran into an elderly
lady. I started having a conversation with her, and she told me about
the town. I walked toward the church to get a better look at it, I
turned around a moment later,and she had disappeared out of sight and
there was no one around. The church itself has had windows broken
and/or cracked from the inside late at night, and the church is locked
at night. the basement is off limits to the general public, and is well
barried and locked inside and out.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">

sound while i was sitting at the computer one night then,when i looked
at an empty 2Litre Pepsi bottle on the desk in front of me i could see
two people standing on each side of me in the reflexion in the bottle
with black cloaks. Then, another strange occurance began, some spectre
of a man use to unlock my door and walk across the living room everyday

chance to see it. So every day at 5 pm this man would unlock my door

standing in tub kicking just tormenting me.After i notice the man i was
standing in the bathroom mirror when i seen my shadow on the wall move
when i look over my shadow had her hair&nbsp; shoulder lenghten but i
had my hair pinned up&nbsp; i got scared and ran out the apartment to
get someone to witness this entity with me. I knew the figure in the
mirror wasn't my reflexion. Later that night i came back with my
roommate and we were sitting on my bed when this pain struck me it was
like a million bees stinging me all over i was in so much pain for the
last 3 months of the 2 years i was there. After the pain struck me we
heard a voice over my roommates head and said hellooo hell ooo and we
both look at each other and i asked him what he heard and we both jump
and ran outside so later the next day same things going on except when
i walked into the room my table with the lamp came flying towards me my

was home alone sitting on my bedd with the bible in my arms all the
time i wanted to go&nbsp; to the kitchen but i was spooked i wanted a

ran out the apartment went got security and 3 others i stood by the
toliet and never moved and my shadow moved to the side and slide down
to the floor everyone seen it there and were all in shock we couldnt

air i couldnt catch my breath for about a min or two not sure my throat
would swell close i go to the doctor there be nothing wrong and the bee
stings were still happening went to doctor&nbsp; nothing went and
bought 200.00 dollars worth of pesticides and still wouldnt go

<span style="font-weight: bold;">I moved into my house in Sacramento CA
in 1994 my Mother and I were loading the kitchen with dishes and, had
sat down to take a break. We were sitting at the dining room table when
the cabinet in the kitchen opened by it's self. My Mom looked at me and
I at her in return and at the same time said did you see
that!&nbsp;&nbsp; On another occasion I was in the tub my Daughter came
in to ask a question.As she started to ask me her question the faucet
in the sink turned on by it's self. We both thought it was so cool and
asked them to turn it off of course it wasn't turned off. We had many
occasions where there was the sound of running on the roof but, no one
was there, also lights went on and off by themselves and two of my dogs
would sit and stare at the corner of the ceiling&nbsp; in our family
room and whine and wag their tails.I have always had things drawn to me
in life and find it most times too cool.</span><br

</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">It was a nice summer evening just as
the sun was getting ready to sit myself and a few of my friends decided
to ride some backroads. We entered a road called McDermott Ridge. We
started talking about the rumors we had heard about the old cemetery
being haunted. So we decided to stop and see for ourselfs. We stopped
along the road i took my camera out to see if we could get some good
photo's to prove that the stories we had heard was true. As we entered
the gate to the cemetery it seemed to have got so dark so fast. We
started looking around at all the graves with grass up to our knees. I
got the most uneasy feeling as if something wanted as out of there! I
started snapping photo's with my camera. Before i could take the
photo's my camera batterys went dead! Good thing i had brought another
pack of batterys i tryed again it let me take 5 photos and again the
batterys went dead! Hmmm, Weird yes! Since i have always heard for a
spirit to manifest itself it will drain batterys... We noticed that
most of the graves was from the 1800s and no one had been buried in
that graveyard for atleast 60 years or so. After about 15 mins i was
ready to go! The uneasy feeling got worse! So we decided it was time to
leave. After we shut the gates to the graveyard. We got back in the
truck. We turned the camera on it worked great now that we went at the
graveyard. We reviewed the photo's and seen what looked like a lady
standing next to her grave. I hadnt seen anyone when we took the
photos. So we decided to go back to the graveyard and take more photos
to see what else we could get. I take another 5-6 photos before my
camera batterys went dead yet again. It felt as if someone was watching
us and whomever it was wanted us out of there! So we ran and shut the
gates behind us and got in out truck. As we drove not even a half mile
from the graveyard we heard a loud the thump! That sound &amp; felt
like a big dog had jumped into the bed of our truck. A friend of mine
stopped the truck and got out and looked into the bed to see if he
could see what it was. He found nothing. So we started again going down
the road. When we head the loud noise but this time it was on the roof
of the truck it beat 3 times sounded like someone was taking a baseball
bat to the roof of the truck beating it down in. But no one was there.
There wasnt even anyone on that road that night we were there. The more
beat on the roof of the truck the louder it would get. I noticed
everytime it beat on the roof it would do it 3 times and stop for about
the 30 seconds then it would start again, I was so scared i started to
scream!!!! We i screamed it started beating louder and louder seemed
like the lady that showed up in our photos was trying to scare us! A
friend of mind had a cb in his truck under his seat we head a loud
noise from the cb then a creepy ghostly voice come over it. Come to
find out the cb was unplugged cause he never used it. How crazy is
that?!?! As soon as we got off that road and came to my house we were
so scared to get outta the truck with everything that went on. As soon
as my friend and i got out of the truck an all back cat came out of
nowhere and shot right in front of us as if it was trying to trip us.
We got inside and took out our camera and started reviewing out photo's
we had took. We seen the lady as plan as day standing by what we think
was her grave. I will never forget what she looked like she has an old
dress on that looked like a long&nbsp; dark color&nbsp; dress maybe a
black and it started at her neck and looked. She had her hair back in a
bun. She also had what looked like from the photos a skeletal
face.&nbsp; It was clear this lady was from the 1800s. She was holding
out her hand in one photo maybe she was searching for someone. It was
clear she wasnt a very friendly person and didnt want us in that
graveyard. We also noticed in another photo that there was a flying
dove light up on one of the old 1800s graves we know that dove was not
on any of thoes graves we had looked at. I will never forget that day
we walked into that graveyard thinking that is was just myth that
ghosts werent real we found out quick that if you mess with them they
will mess with you back. I sometimes think alot about that night. I
feel as if that lady whos name was Mary McDermott from what it said on
her grave that she was pictured beside of was searching from someone.
It seems like her soul wasnt at rest. And i hope one day that she can
find peace.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">

old , coming from school with some friends. Nobody was at home and I
decided to invite my friends over. So we got to the main door and we
all heard footsteps, so we ran out as fast as we can and in one of the
glass windows we saw a figure of a man he had this black kind of clouck
and a long kind of stick at the end of it there was anyway I went to my

<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">My husband and I lived in a house for
2 years. During that time my husband started getting very mean and
depressed. One morning he woke up saying he couldn't live anymore. He
went out to a shed we had and hung himself.&nbsp; I was somehow able to
lift him up long enough for my 3 year daughter to grab a bucket to put
under his feet. Later my daughter saw a picture of my husbands grandma
that she has never meet and said she was there helping me. After the
whole ordeal my neighbors came over and told me that he is the 3rd
person that has lived there to do that. The first person had shot
himself in the head and died right in front of the shed. The second
person had tried to stab himself. My husband was the third. I guess I
am wondering if it is possible if there could be an evil presence&nbsp;
that is causing it. Or maybe the first guy that succeeded. It could be
all a coincidence. There was also a lady that died there of old age. I
live only a mile away from that house now, but I will never go back. We
have lived in our current house for 3 years now and my husband is a
completely different person than when we lived there.</span><br

My name is June. When I was a little girl I lived in a haunted house on
Oley Street in Reading, Pa. I am now 54 yo the spirits that I have seen
happened when I was six yo before we moved into the house that is when
it started. My mother me and my grandmother were cleaning the house
before we moved in and we were upstairs mom and grand mom went to the
front rooms to clean and the back room was all mine since I had 3
brothers who were all younger than me. I guess the year was 1963......
I looked out my bedroom window and saw a man a woman a little boy and
little girl all dressed in black the man and the boy had black hats on
and the woman and the girl had black bonnets on. I thought they were
our neighbors so I yelled for my mom and grand mom to tell them then I
looked out again and they were all pointing at me so I kinda was
scared. By the time my grand mom and mom came back to my room they were
gone. I was always afraid of that room but somehow felt comforted right
before I fell asleep it seemed like there was an angel there in my room
to help me fall asleep. I always slept with the window closed because
one night I looked out the window over the roof and there was a man on
the roof so I never opened that window.............. anyway a couple
years passed and one night I decided to change beds with my oldest of
the 3 brothers since we just got new bunk beds the boys did. So mom and
dad were sleeping in the front room and my brother Tim and I were
laughing and talking and all of the sudden I saw the figure of a man he
was all white no face just the shape he was standing at the top of the
stairs. He started walking over towards my brother and I with his hand
out he came and me then he went to go to my brother and I screamed for
my dad and then he was gone. But the house brought much bad luck to our
family. There was a huge room up in the attic that you had to crawl
through this little door to get to. It was said someone hung themselves
in that room. The rafters were very high. I only went in their once or
twice I was to scared I thought I wouldn't be able to get out.My dad
was a hunter and sportsman and he used to load bullets up in the
attic..........anyway I still have dreams of that house my dad was
killed there by the police in 1969 when I was 11 and I was in the
middle of the vicious fight between mom dad and the policeman that came
to her rescue...........anyway that house still haunts me and I still
wonder who the people were in the yard that night. There is so much
more to tell but I am running out of time because I am using a friends
computer and he has to go, so I will stop here. I think I am very
psychic and have powers to communicate with the dead through
dreams...........anyway have a nice day just wanted to tell you my
story.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Hi. My name is Sam and I was wondering
if I could send in my story to The Shadowlands. Here it is: Back when I
was a kid, I was scared of a number of things when I went to bed. One
time I woke up in the middle of the night. I was scared to turn to the
other side of the bed so I just lay right there. I kept thinking about
what I was scared of and all of the sudden I felt something like some
fingers touch me. I was really startled. There was no one in my room,
though. That's my story</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Back Story on Coon Creek Bridge </span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
dragonmamma35@yahoo.com&nbsp; </span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">My 2 Great-grandfather Pickett donated
the land for Mound Cemetery to Washington County on the condition that
all his descendents have a free plot there.&nbsp; In this cemetery
there are 2 girls that drowned on the same day.&nbsp; They were best
friends.&nbsp; One of the girls is a relative and the other is
not.&nbsp; The girl that is not a relative started to drown and the
relative girl jumped in to try and save her and neither survived.&nbsp;
I don't remember their names any more but could readily show you their
stones in the cemetery.&nbsp; Also, there were several bridges that
crossed Coon Creek so you will want to be more specific as to which one
it was.&nbsp; For instance, there was a bridge just north of my
Great-grandparents, Alfred and Grace (Bolejack) Pickett's farm that was
washed out in a flood and never replaced.&nbsp; There are at least 3
more bridges I'm aware of that span Coon Creek.&nbsp; I have fished off
all of them as a girl.&nbsp; If I remember correctly the relative girl
that drowned saving her friend is related on the Bolejack side.&nbsp;
Alfred Pickett married Grace Bolejack and his brother Malcom Pickett
married Grace's sister Ethel.&nbsp; So there was an instance of
brothers marrying sisters.&nbsp; There was also a 3rd girl that drowned
that isn't buried at Mound, but I don't remember much about her except
that she drowned in a family pond, not Coon Creek.&nbsp; The reason my
2Great-grandfather donated the land was because there was a small town
that was all wiped out from some sort of illness outbreak.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><br

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Pregnancies</span><br

<br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp; I have been reading about
people sharing their experiences and want to share one of mine. I may
share more but am not sure yet because people try to say I'm crazy. For
some reason I am surrounded by nonbelievers. It's very hard to share
experiences with someone like that. I learned to just keep them to
myself.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The story I decided to share has to do
with my first pregnancy. My second one was way worse but I'll try this
one out first and leave that for another time. For some reason when I'm
pregnant I am harassed by spirits more than usual. My first pregnancy
was in 2008-2009. I was finishing up my senior year of college at
LaGrange College in LaGrange, GA, so I lived in a dorm. During the
night I was constantly awakened by a small black thing next to my bed.
It was furry and the fur was long, pointy and oily. Also it walked on
all fours and it would pace back and forth. I'm guessing it was some
sort of spirit animal (a jackal maybe?). It would do that for a few
hours and then it would be gone. One night I asked my boyfriend to
spend the night and tell me if he saw it too. When it came he did see
it and asked it to leave. It never came back.&nbsp;&nbsp; For a few
months nothing happened. Then one night I stayed with my boyfriend and
his mom. We were up watching movies and decided to sleep in the living
room. I slept on the couch and he was on the floor. In the middle of
the night I woke up. Everything was off and my boyfriend was sleep. I
was about to get up to go to the bathroom when a woman in a long
flowing white dress entered. She walked across the room to the couch
and looked at me. Then she climbed the arm of the couch and crawled up
to the back and stretched out and put her head on her arm and kept
staring. I was so scared I jumped on the floor with my boyfriend and
said I wanted to sleep with him. He asked me what happened but I
wouldn't tell him.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next day we were in the
kitchen talking and all of a sudden I stopped. Next to the refrigerator
was a man in a derby hat. He tipped his hat as if to say hello then
turned to go down the hallway to my boyfriend's dad's room. I told my
boyfriend what I saw and about the lady from the previous night. He was
upset that I didn't tell him about the lady right when it happened. As
for the man he said that his grandfather wore derby hats and that his
mom told him that the spirit was there watching his dad because he was
sick.&nbsp;&nbsp; Nothing else happened until after I had my son.
Almost immediately after I got home I was being haunted. My boyfriend
and I had just moved in together. One day I was in the shower (we had a
clear shower curtain) and a small child came in and began using the
toilet (he was standing so it's a little boy). He had blonde hair, a
red shirt and blue jeans. I saw him clearly. Immediately I hollered for
my boyfriend, but by the time he got there the boy was gone. I told him
what happened and he said to tell him when the boy would show up again.
Unfortunatley he never did when my boyfriend was around. My boyfriend
worked at night, so I would often be alone with the baby. I would be
plagued throughout the night with baby cries and banging. Of course, I
thought something happened to the baby and would be constantly running
to check on him. He would be fast asleep. I told my boyfriend and he
got tired of it </span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">after a while. He decided that the
spirit was not good or a child and decided to confront it.&nbsp;&nbsp;
One night, after I fell asleep, my boyfriend stayed awake. The next day
I found out that he had not slept at all because he had gone to the
back porch to call out the spirit. He said the spirit came to the back
door and looked at him. My boyfriend told it that he knew it wasn't a
child and that it needed to leave me alone. He told it that it was
unwelcome and had to go. The spirit's faced contorted into an angry
glare and it turned red. Then it disappeared. My boyfriend said that it
reappeared in the parking lot in front of our porch (we lived in an
apartment complex) and paced back and forth in front of him. My
boyfriend told it that he did not care how mad it got, it was not
welcome in our apartment. It kept pacing the parking lot the rest of
the night and my boyfriend stayed there with it to make sure it
understood how serious he was. Just before sunrise it eventually gave
up and walked away. My boyfriend is very brave and I'm thankful that he
did that for me because I never saw it again.</span><br

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Personal Experiences</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;Hello my name is Amber Thomas
I'm thirty two years old, and have never written down some of the
things I have felt or witnessed over the years. I have talked with
close friends and family about it. Here are three instances of things
happening in my late teenage years.&nbsp;&nbsp; The first memorable
experience was when I was around seventeen years old. I was laying in
bed asleep when I woke to feeling a pressure on my chest. As I woke up
more completely I felt that I couldn't move or speak, and heard
something like the buzzing of bees. Then I heard and felt a presence
and heard a voice whisper in my ear " I wish I could bite through your
throat" along with more pressure around my neck. You would think I was
dreaming, but I had a sugar glider at the time and even though I
couldn't move or respond I clearly remember Melon my sugar glider
running like crazy in it's cage and making distressed noises. I had to
use every bit of will I had to mentally put together a prayer it was
the only thing I could think of. As much as I wanted to speak it aloud
I felt bound and had tears streaming down my face. I finally managed to
garble out a prayer and after the third repetition I felt unbound and
could move and speak. I was in hysterics, and the hair on my arms and
neck was standing on end. I jumped from my bed and ran downstairs for
my mom and dad. I woke them and started bawling my eyes out. My Dad
told me to stay downstairs and went to my room. I didn't follow him,
but as he left he said " Things like this will not happen in my house".
He spent the rest of the night in my room.&nbsp;&nbsp; The next
experience happened when I was nineteen. I was once again in bed on the
verge of sleep when I saw a man in my room. He was dressed in white and
spoke to me saying " My brother is the light and the life of the world"
I was paying close attention to him and out of the corner of my eye I
saw a large shadow figure of a man with no features I could tell
running at me. I remember throwing up my arm and then feeling as if a
truck had hit me. The next thing I recall is sitting up in bed once
again with my hair on end and a feeling of terror. I once again went to
my parents room, but just took a blanket and laid on their floor. In
the morning I told my mom what had happened and showed how I had thrown
up my arm, and there in the exact spot I had felt hit was a
bruise.&nbsp;&nbsp; The last memorable experience was again at
nineteen. I was driving home late at night and was just coming into
town . As I'm about to cross the railroad tracks a huge black dog was
standing in my headlights, and just looking at me. It may not seem
strange, but as I'm looking at this dog it just vanished and left me
with my hair on end and a feeling of terror and almost feeling dirty. A
few years later I was recalling this story with friends, and one
started laughing and told me that there were plenty of stories or tall
tales about people seeing black ghost dogs. I had never heard of any
and put it aside till recently. I looked up some stories and the
stories I have read are uncanny in similarities. I can swear all these
things are true and as exact as I can remember. You don't forget things
like this. All my life I have had dreams that seemed so real that when
I would wake they would bother me the rest of the day, and some
sometimes longer. As far as feelings go I have always been able to get
what I jokingly call "vibes about things". I can read people, and this
has caused a bit of confrontation with my husband because he would
bring a friend home or we would meet random people, and after I would
tell him I didn't want them at my house or that I had one of my bad gut
feelings about them. After ten years of being married he finally
listens to me because I have never been wrong. After knowing these
people something always comes out later about them that has my husband
telling me I was right.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">

<span style="font-weight: bold;">The Voices in my Laptop</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">By:&nbsp; nicolpena12@yahoo.com</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">I was 12 I think. I was sitting on the
basement floor, my sister sitting behind me on the bed. I had my
headphones plugged into the laptop, and was listening to sounds coming
from the game I was playing when I heard someone say "Hello?" I thought
it was my sister, the tv, or the game, but it wasn't. I turned the
volume down to zero on my laptop, yet the voice kept saying "Hello?" I
unplugged my headphones, so now my sister could hear it too. She asked
me what's going on with my laptop, and I told her I didn't know. The
"Hello?"s just kept going, speaking over the game until I finally
turned off the laptop. That same night it happened again. Only this
time I didn't have my headphones plugged in, and my sister was
sleeping. Plus, instead&nbsp; of "Hello?" it was the giggling of a
little girl, and it just got louder and louder until again, I turned
off the laptop.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The Man in Mom's Room</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">My little sister, 10 years-old, was
the first to see him. She had told my mom that she seen a man standing
at her bathroom door. My mother responded saying that the man watched
over her while she slept, and that he wouldn't hurt us. A few days
later I was going up the steps to my room, but stopped at the top step.
Standing in my doorway was the man I believe my sister saw. He looked
like he had rolled in mud for days, wore baggy pants, and a thick army
like coat. He just looked at me, as if trying to see how I'd react, but
I just stared back at him. I went into my room, and he was still there.
I wasn't afraid. I could tell he wouldn't hurt me, and he didn't. </span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;The Basement Door</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">I was 10, or 11 when it happened. I
had stayed up 'til around 3am, and went to the dining room to play on
my laptop. After all, everyone else in my family was asleep and I was
bored. I had only been on my laptop for about 10 minutes when I heard a
sort of squeaking noise. I didn't know where it came from, but for some
reason I looked directly at the basement door. The doorknob began to
turn ever so slowly, and the door was pushed open causing an eerie bone
chilling screech to be emitted from the hinges. The weird thing is that
no one was there, just endless darkness took the place of where the
someone who had opened the door should be. Then I was paralyzed. I
couldn't move, couldn't talk. I don't even think I was breathing. All I
could do was look directly at the basement door. I had this feeling in
my gut someone was watching me, and then the feeling was lifted. It
just disappeared. I was so shocked that I simply stood up, went up to
my room, and went to bed. Now I'm about to start High School, and more
things have happened.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">

<span style="font-weight: bold;">My Home Growing Up</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">By:&nbsp; auntshooey@gmail.com</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">I grew up on a farm in western
Nebraska, in a house my Grandfather had built and where his body was
laid for viewing after he died. Unusual occurences were common.
Footsteps, banging noises, cold spots and feelings of dread were
commonplace for me.&nbsp; Our family would be gathered at the dinner
table for supper and we would hear a door slam shut upstairs. We all
would just look at each other and someone would end up making a joke
about what had just happened.&nbsp; I don't recall my age exactly,
maybe 9 or 10 when I worked up the courage to ask my Mom is there were
ghosts in our house.&nbsp; When I did ask, instead of the reassuring
,"There's no such things as ghosts.", answer I was hoping for. She just
looked at me sweetly and said, "Oh Honey. They're just family. They
aren't going to hurt you." I can't begin to tell you how that made me
feel. I was still clinging to some hope that it all was just my silly
childish imagination.&nbsp; My sisters and I all saw ,at one time or
another, an apparition walking the hall upstairs outside our bedrooms.
Each young mind rationalized it in it's own way. I saw Cousin It from
The Addams Family TV show. Another sister saw a clown so on and so
forth. Although we were scared of the dark, our closets and the
basement every day we lived in the house. It wasn't until I was 19 that
I was absolutely terrified there.&nbsp; My Mom had been diagnosed with
Lupus in 1970 and the disease finally took her in 1978. I had gotten my
first job and had moved out on my own. Dad had gone on a trip and
wanted me to stay out at the house to keep an eye on things while he
was gone.&nbsp; I love to read, so I was sitting in Mom's comfy rocker
with a book when I started hearing this odd noise from outside. It
started out very low just barely&nbsp; audible and then would get a
little louder. I honestly can't describe it exactly, except that it was
muffled and mumbled.&nbsp; I turned on the outside light on the south
side of the house and saw nothing so I continued to read. Again the
sound comes from outside behind me. Starting low and then increasing in
volume still muffled and mumbled but occasionally sounding like
children off in the distance chattering as they played. Now it's 11 PM
out in the middle of rural Nebraska. There are NO children running
around playing outside.&nbsp; I started to become a little more uneasy
at this point and decided to brave it out. I turned the outside light
on, grabbed a flashlight from the drawer and headed outside to
investigate. The closer I got to that side of the house I started
getting goose bumps on my arms. I looked around the house and flashed
the light towards the garden area. Nothing was there. I stopped to
listen as best I could, my heart was beating so loudly in my ears.
Nothing. So I chalked it up to maybe a hurt animal farther out in the
garden or something.&nbsp; This continued to happen during my stay. In
a couple of days Dad returned so I went home to my apartment.&nbsp; The
few weeks later I decided to go out to the house and talk to Dad about
what had happened. I pulled up in the yard, shut my car off, opened the
door&nbsp; and before I could take my first step the noise began only
this time much, much louder that it had ever been before. It was so
creepy the hairs on the back of my neck stood up on end. I was so
freaked out that I just screamed at the top of my lungs for whatever it
was to STOP! But it continued getting&nbsp; louder like whatever it was
was coming towards me. I screamed for my Dad but he was inside and
didn't hear me. I jumped back into my car and raced home. I called him
and told him what had happened and asked if he had heard anything
weird. He told me that he had been hearing it for a couple of weeks
before he left and again since he got home. It lasted a few more weeks,
he said, and then it stopped.&nbsp; I will never know exactly what was
making that horrible sound. Thinking about it to this day, 30+ years
later, I still get goose bumps. It couldn't have been an animal. Dad
said he had checked all over the yard and garden, for several days
while it was light outside and found nothing. I just know whatever it
was, it wasn't family, it wasn't good and I wasn't going to hang around
to find out what the hell it was or what it wanted.</span><br

<span style="font-weight: bold;">My Home</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<span style="font-weight: bold;">As far as Brown Avenue,yes.The last
death was in 1999.Over the years prior to that,I am not sure.I know the
original owner was a banker,with the last name starting with "S".When
we first moved in,we had to clean it out from the owners wife,she
passed away there&nbsp; from alcohol and drug abuse.Her portrait hung
over her piano for a year.&nbsp; My daughter was knealing on the
bench,talking to her painting,she did not know the lady,but said her
name loud and clear. Christmas' and holidays were grand,and we always
felt her presence there moreso at those times.&nbsp;&nbsp; after
that,the kids were upstairs playing,they all come down the stairs
screaming.The third child claimed there is a black knight upstairs,
and,in our main hallway-I had the house blessed and things started to
die down for a while. Our family went through a lot of personal issues
in the home,my husband at the time was drinking heavily and had become
more abusive than ever.My parents died four days apart,what I could
salvage from the home I grew up in,was moved into the house.Antiques
mainly.Later that same year my daughter was walking in the gangway and
was attacked by a leashed dog.With one bite,it broke her arm.The last
straw was when I was trying to get a better job,and had to study for
it,I had the kids with me all weekend I stayed at a friends house to
avoid the drinking husband from interrupting my studies or disturbing
the children.Needless to say,the home was trashed,and when I saw the
condition I decided to leave.A divorce ensued not too long after
that.Sometimes I wonder if this "spirit" thing was carried over from a
home we lived in years ago in Calumet City,and I wonder if furniture
can do the same?On Wentworth the first night we moved in,we heard
someone walk across the top of the floor but noone lived there. we
called police there was nothing.There was a brand new lock on the door
and there was no way anyone got in there.This kind of thing continued.A
family that had lived there prior for fifteen years warned us,they too
knew it was haunted.Their family lost the house,went totally broke.The
father had been injured and could not work anymore. They told me two
people on different occaisions died in that home-one in teh 50's hung
himself in the upstairs,the other I am not sure when.I went onto the
backporch that was enclosed to get to the laundry room downstairsand
the door slammed behind me,and I fell.When I tried to re-enter the
home,I couldn't open the door.There's more I will write in the next
email/happening.&nbsp; She knew I was there and wanted to talk to me
and say good bye. The strange happenings went on and were kind of used
to it.We rented the place from a man whom we thought owned the
property-in all reality-he didn't he was buying it on contract.from a
school teacher whose husband had purchased the property,became ill and
died.All the rent we gave to this guy was supposed to be going to the
school teacher.He never paid her,then a real estate agent came and he
said we should pay him.It was so confusing,we actually had to go to the
mayors office to find out who to pay.In the end,the house was purchased
by the van Dam family.They renovated the top floor,then they would be
working on our apartment- we moved.I came back to pick up the remainder
of our things,making sure the fridge was cleaned out,and a hammer fell
on my head from atop the fridge. That was my cue to leave.&nbsp; I
moved to Metea Indiana.&nbsp; It is off of Route 25 in between
Rochester and Logansport. I was on my own with the kids and found a
deal! A five bedroom house in a rural area. I could finally&nbsp;
afford a place where all my kids had their own room.The property sits
on 4 acres of land and it was a big change from the city of Hammond.I
had been separated 8 yrs. divorced for 4 and was starting to really do
well.Everyday it was a 2.5 hour drive one way back to work,but that was
okay,the kids had a safe place to live.As I was getting ready for the
move,a friend of mine helped me move an old radio cabinet separately
from the moving truck that was packed.He was upstairs checking the
electrical and I was downstairs picturing where everything was going to
go.The living room was separated from the dining area by French doors.
Out of the corner of my eye I saw a little barefooted boy in overalls
run through into the kitchen, looked and there was nothing. I figured I
was seeing things.Later,the strange occurrences started up again.Doors
with no lock were jammed,we couldn't get t.v.or phone service to that
house the whole time we lived there.No one would serve the area of that
home,yet the neighbors had it.There was always something
watching.Towards the end of us living there,a man was seen with clothes
from maybe the forty's walking through the hallway upstairs.It looked
as if he was getting ready for work.it was daylight,and i saw the whole
top of him but no feet walking away quickly.at that time people with
their back to the door felt a chill at the same time I saw him.On
different occasions people who had lived in the home in the past
stopped by,to either ask if mail came what have you,one was even born
in the home and just wanted a tour of the home.The little boy I had
seen in the very beginning made himself known to the people who lived
there for 17 yrs. According to the woman,she said his name was Billy
and he was killed on the property in a freak farming accident.She was
aware of the old farmer,and his wife.i never had the pleasure of seeing
her.Needless to say,after driving back and forth for two years to
work,my job was eliminated and I got to stay home.The more time I spent
in that home,the more I could see it was going on again.I went broke,my
family split up,and I now reside in a one bdrm apartment in Hammond.I
have pictures I can show you and you be the judge.When I hear people
say they went through pretty much the same thing-I believe them.They
don't know me but they had the same experiences.I am not alone.Back in
my day,when people would talk about ghosts they were laughed at or
thought crazy.With all the technology,and proof there is,how can
everyone be crazy? There is some form of life after we leave here.I
think there is more than enough proof that these people are trying to
communicate with the living.They just don't always know how.</span><br>
