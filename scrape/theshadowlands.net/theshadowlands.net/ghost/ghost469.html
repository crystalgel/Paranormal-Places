I
went to a K-3 school a few years ago, and you heard footsteps behind
you in <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">the
hallways and stairwells, and in the autotorium, you heard people
walking up and

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">down
the
rows, the curtains would sway with no draft, and you even heard the <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">squeaking
of seat-hinges. All of us kids would feel chills up our spines at the
same <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">moment,
and seconds later we would hear footsteps or knocking. We thought it
was <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">posessed
by John Young Dater, students who had died there (it had earlier been a

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">things

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">I
am a
great fan of your website. I have some stories that I have heard from
family.
Here is one that my Grandpa encountered, his father had recently died
in 1993,
and the night of his funeral, he was awoke by something. He didn't know
what it
was he was just awoken by whatever it was. He looked over and his
father was
standing there saying I am okay, please do not worry. My grandpa got a
drink of
water and his father left, he went right through the door.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Then
I
have one from family friends. This was when friends Steve and Rita had
moved
into a new house, they had seen several apparitions, that they have not
really
explained, but really just blobs, then here comes the scary part. Here
are 2
stories that I have also inquired from this same person.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Rita
and
her husband and 2 friends were in the family room in the middle of the
day
talking and all 4 of them saw a shadow jump from the balcony slide
across the
family room and go under the couch. Steps have also creaked and toilets
have
flushed for no apparent reason. This was also a new house, with no
history of
violence on the property. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Now
for
the second story, a couple of nights later, Rita was sleeping and woke
to
feeling like someone was sitting on top of her trying to choke her,
Steve woke
up to Rita's screams and flipped the lights on, she told him there was
a man
with a plaid shirt in the room trying to choke her, no one was in the
room, she
got up out of bed, and went to the dresser, looked in the mirror, and
he was
behind her, a lumberjack looking man in a plaid shirt standing behind
her. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">This
also might
sound kind of queer, but my mother Bernadette, lived in a new
neighborhood,
when she was little, outside of the development was a field with a very
small
house almost a shed, whenever my Mom took a walk with her grandma, a
little
girl would come running out of the house/shed and talk with them. She
was
always dressed old fashioned with a dress on. She resembled a little
girl like
Shirley Temple. she said her name was Judy. My mom saw her several
times, her
grandma also did too. Years later when she mentioned Judy to her
mother, her
mother said, nobody had ever lived in that house, it was used for
storage, a
shed, and said my mother was making it up, and that it was a story. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">We
have
never figured out if it was a ghost or not. My great-grandmother
remembered her
too.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Just
like
every other child growing up, I had an imaginary friend. I named her
Elizabeth,
but sometimes I felt like I should call her Emily or Liz. I treated
Elizabeth
as if she were a real person; I pretended to put clothes on my bed for
her, get
her an extra plate for dinner, buy a toothbrush just for her. My
grandma was
obsessed with taking pictures. This was when things began to become
strange. I
was on the swings at this local playground. I saved a swing for
Elizabeth. As
my grandma started taking the pictures, the swing started shaking, as
if
someone was on it. It wasn't windy, and it wasn't me swinging it. My
grandma, a
bit frightened, decided to leave and go to Wal-greens. After we picked
up the
developed the pictures, the cashier gave us a discount. Her words were,
"Miss, the price is cut in half. Apparently the little girl on the
right
swing is faded, and we can't figure out why." My grandma freaked; so
did
I. I was on the left swing, not the right. I looked at the picture, and
I
realized that it looked EXACTLY like my imaginary friend. My grandma
told my
mom, who then decided to take random pictures of me when I was playing
with my
"friend". In almost every picture, my imaginary friend somehow
appeared to be next to me, the exact way I pictured her in my mind. My
grandma
and mom couldn't think why this was happened; they thought their minds
were
just messing around. My great-grandmother in Europe was sent several
pictures
of me, because she never saw me before. She called my grandma on the
phone and
asked why she was sent pictures of this little girl Elizabeth Emily
Zargic.
Apparently, Elizabeth Emily Zargic. was a young girl killed in the
Yugoslavian
war. She was mistaken for a Croatian man's daughter. Elizabeth was
planning to
move to the United States to start a new life, to be free. My grandma
asked
what the connection was; her mother had an affair with my cousin, who
disgraced
the family. Elizabeth Emily was actually a cousin of mine. I was born
on the
day she passed away. My imaginary best friend was not imaginary; she
was my
guardian angel.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">I
live in
Ottawa, Ontario, Canada and there are several locations in this city
that have
reported hauntings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before Ottawa became
Ottawa, it was called Bytown, after Colonel John By, who built The
Rideau Canal
in our city.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the banks of the canal,
near the downtown core, there is a log building that was used for the
men and
their families who helped build the canal.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Many of the men and their families died of plague and other
similar
diseases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This log cabin is now The
Bytown Museum, so you can imagine the kinds of things that must go on
there,
with the sadness that surrounds it's history.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is also one of the oldest buildings in Ottawa.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">And
so my
story begins.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have always been
fascinated with the paranormal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is
a haunted walk that takes place in Ottawa, that takes you through many
haunted
downtown locations and the guide gives you a history of the place as
well as
the reported <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">hauntings.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>I have done the walk many times, but this one
occasion was very different.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My sister
in law and her friend really wanted to go, so I decided to tag along.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>One of the stops was The Bytown Museum.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>There are many reported hauntings there and
one of the reports was that of people hearing children crying.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>The group I was with that night was comprised
mostly of women.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I forget now which
floor we were on - it was the floor with the children's display.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>It is full of artifacts that relate to
children in those days, clothing, toys etc.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The guide said a couple of times that this particular floor is
her least
favorite and that it creeps her out and as a <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">result,
she'd like to tell the story and move on quickly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So...after
she explains the history with the
children in this museum, we move on to the next corner on that floor to
discuss.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The three <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">of
us are
standing at the back of the group.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
keep hearing tiny footsteps behind me, as if they are running around a
display
case directly behind me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I chalked it up
to my imagination, since we had just discussed children.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I don't know how to explain what happened
next...but I will never forget it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
still play it over and over in my mind to this day.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>All of a sudden, on my right and next to me,
I heard a child's voice, as clear as a bell say "Is that you
mommy?."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well....I was completely
freaked out...and to make matters worse, my sister in law, her friend
and two
other women all heard the same thing I did.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We all looked at each other and said...did <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">you
hear
that??<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My sister in law, who is in
between being a skeptic and believer says "yeah right, if that was
anything, it'll do it again...".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Before she could finish her sentence, it happened again...this
time it
said "Mommy?..." and started saying something else but stopped
suddenly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I was completely freaked
out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have had many experiences, but
nothing
as concrete as this and with other witnesses to boot.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I did some research...asked the front desk if
there were any children in there tonight...nope...do you have a sound
system...no...is this a trick?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
looked kind of annoyed when I said this.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is a really old building made of wood...getting a sound
system hooked
up in there would be pretty difficult.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">I
still
can't explain it to this day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was
THAT REAL.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You don't expect something
this huge to happen and it seems so impossible, you need to explain it
away,
because how could that possibly be?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But
it happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If you're ever in Ottawa,
you should check it <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">out...it
is a neat place with lots of history...and lots of spooky happenings to

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">When
I was
about 9 years old, I had my first paranormal experience..<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>My bedroom was in the basement of the house I
grew up in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I have three younger
sisters, and we lived with my parents in a three bedroom home-so my dad
make-shifted two rooms downstairs for me and one of my sisters.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>Well my sister who stayed downstairs with me
was afraid of her room&#8212;it was cold and she said it felt like someone
was always
watching her&#8212;so for the first couple of months we stayed down there,
she stayed
in my room with me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well, I got sick of
sharing, so I finally kicked her out.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Soon afterward, I would hear scratching on the wall between our
rooms
(from inside her closet) and soft talking/whimpering.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I figured my sister was being dramatic, and
told her to shut up and go to sleep.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After a few nights of this happening, I finally got fed up and
barged
into her room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well, I scared her,
because she woke up and started screaming from the noise I made.<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>There was no way that in the time it took me
to get into her room she could have climbed out of her closet, jumped
into her
bed (without making noise) and pretended to fall asleep without
breaking her
leg on her way over there through all her clothes and stuff on the
ground.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I didn't tell her why I barged in
because I
didn't want to freak her out even more. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">My
mom and
other sisters each had their own experiences, too.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>One day when we were all at school and my dad
was at work, my mom was in the basement doing laundry.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There was storage under the stairs, with my
sister&#8217;s bedroom blocking one side, the other side was open to the
laundry
area.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My mom heard shuffling noises
coming from under the stairs, and when she turned around, she saw an
arm and a
hand lying on one of the shelves-the hand was sort of drooping over the
side.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">The
middle
of my younger sisters never willingly went into the basement, because
she could
hear someone whispering her name down there if she stood by the open
door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">My
baby
sister (lol she&#8217;s like 20 now), anyway, when she was 3, told me she
didn&#8217;t like
the lady who stood at the top of the stairs.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We didn&#8217;t have a TV when she was a baby, and she was extremely
sheltered, so I was convenced she was being honest.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The other day when we talked about it, she
described it in better detail&#8212;when she walked through the kitchen
towards the
basement, and turned the corner and the basement door was open, she saw
the
side of the lady, and as she moved closer, the rest of the body
appeared and
the lady was staring at her&#8230;She told me that she stood on the second or
third
step down and her body was turned forward, except for her head, which
was
turned toward my sister and looking down at her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
looked like a live person, only silent
and of course creepy&#8230;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Well,
thanks so much for letting me share my stories!<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I've had other experiences myself since i've moved out, but I'll
save
them for another time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">This
all
started in I think 1987 or 1988. It all started our first night in this
house I
was the one <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">who
picked
out the house. We looked at a few different houses and this one just
stood out
for <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">some
reason. The first night we moved in here was definately interesting I
was
laying in my new <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">bed
and
looking around the room. We got a new grandfather clock and that
started to
strike <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">midnight.
I have no idea why I remember that but as the clock started to chime
this black
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">apparition
walked from the hallway into my room, walked across the room and exited
out of
the <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">wall.
It
was pure black and was about 6 foot tall or so. I also remember it had
a hat
and I think a <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">trench
coat on or atleast that I could make out. I didn't sleep in my room for
a few
years after <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">that.
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">There
were
other things happening too. But that was the only time I saw a full
figured
apparition <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">in
the
house. My mom, dad or anybody else that lived here has ever said
anything but I
think my <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">mom
or dad
saw something. My mom and I saw flashes of white light on the corner of
our eyes.
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">I
got
pretty mad I remember and said to knock it off. and it stopped it did
start up
again a year <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">or
two
later but only lasted a month which I did tell it to stop. My
mom,dad,brother,
and I were <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">watching
tv one evening and I turned my head and for some reason looked at a hat
that
was <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">laying
on
the fire place and it suddenly lifted up about 6 inches and dropped. I
yelled
out holy <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">crap
what
was that, Nobody believed me. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;"><span
 style="">&nbsp;</span>the first two or three years in this house
things would like to fall off shelves. I remember seeing <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">some
paper
plates that were in the middle of the table and a few minutes after I
walked by
they <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">dropped
to
the floor. It wasn't the wind or anything like that the plates would
have had
to have <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">been
pushed or one side of the table had to have been lifted pretty high. It
seems
that the activity will just randomly start up for maybe a few months
then stop.
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">I
have
heard talking coming from below my room there was nobody down there I
could
never <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">hear
what
the voices would say I could just feel the vibrations but it was a man
and a
woman. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;"><span
 style="">&nbsp;</span>I can't think of any pictures that have caught
something weird and there have been tons of <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">pictures
taken here. The activity is still here last summer for about a month
weird
things would <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">happen.
The
apex of it was I was home alone and I started to hear what I thought
was
furniture <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">being
drug
around in the room below mine. I also heard what sounded like the phone
ringing
and somebody leaving a message and I heard my name. I checked the
recorder and nothing
nor was there anything on the caller ID. I'm probably missing a bunch
of stuff
but alot of odd things have happened here.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;"><span
 style="">&nbsp;</span>When I lived at my old house in North Liberty
IN, my friend and I stayed up <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">late.
It
was exactly 1:00AM when we saw a rather weird sight in the parlor. We <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">saw
what
appeared to be a 4 foot see through figure wearing an extremly bright <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">neon
yellow shoulder pads. I saw it first and I told my friend to look and
she <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">saw
it
too. It was floating about 2 feet off the floor and it floated there <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">for
about
5 seconds then it said shhhh and it tucked its head down and turned <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">into
mist
and went into the dining room. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;"><span
 style="">&nbsp;</span>I stayed up until 1:00 the next night to see
if it would appear again, but I <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">never
saw
it again downstairs. I was it the attic a few weeks later alone and <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">I
had a
feeling that I should get out. Right when I began to leave the power <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">to
the
section I was in went out! I heard a shhh sound again but it sounded <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">like
someone was laughing. I ran out and the next day I checked the light
but <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">it
did not
burn out and the breaker did not trip. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">I
have a
few short "happenings" that have gone on around me and my mom
(individually) since <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">before
I
was born.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">1-
My mom
and her sister and cousins were playing with a Ouija board at my
great-aunts
house <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">one
night.
Of course, the whole thing happened where it began to move, and each
one blamed
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">the
other
for moving it, while each one denied having done so. This was back in
the day
when <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">indoor
plumbing wasn't available, and my mom had to go use the restroom in the
middle
of the <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">night.
She
walked to the edge of the porch and looked out at the outhouse-
standing behind
it, <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">looking
right at her was a black shadow of a man...a really large man wearing a
wide
brimmed <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">hat.
Needless to say, she didn't make it to the restroom.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">2-
(Backstory-When my mom was pregnant with me, she would watch horror
flicks all
by <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">herself-
one was the Exorcist) <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;"><span
 style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>So, my mom and dad lived in a tiny
single
wide trailer when I was first born, and my bedroom <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">was
down
the hall from theirs. One night I was crying and my mom got up to check
on me. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">When
she
walked out of her bedroom door to enter the hall, she saw a lady all in
white-
white<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">gown,
white flowing hair, etc floating horizontally between her and my room.
Despite
her fear, <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">she
ran
through the apparition to check on me, and I, of course was fine. She
never
again let me sleep alone in that room the duration of our stay in that
trailer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">3-
There's
nothing really "ghostly"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>about
this, but when my mom told me, it really freaked me <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">out.
Her
and daddy took me to the zoo when I was a couple years old. Everything
was
going <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">great,
until we passed the cage with the black panther in it. Mom said that it
stopped
and stared <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">at
me.
When we would walk past it, it would turn and follow, never taking it's
eyes
off of me. If <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">we
turned
around and walked the other direction, it would do the same...again
never
taking it's <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">eyes
off
of me. I don't know if that means anything or not, but it's scary to
hear after
all these <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">years.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">4-Finally,
when I was 6 years old, my papa passed away. He had been sick for a
long time
with <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">mouth
and
lung cancer, and he passed away in the den of my nanny's home. For the
longest
time though, he would sleep in the bed adjaccent to my nanny's, because
he was
so sick. So there were always two beds in her room for as long as I can
remember. Any time I spent the night with her, that is where I slept.
One
night, we were sleeping, and for some reason I just opened my eyes. I
looked
over at nannys bed, and I saw my papa standing there, looking down at
her. He
never said anything. Then he turned and looked at me, smiled, and
simply
disappeared. To this day I wonder if I was dreaming that or not, but it
felt so
incredibly real to me. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">When
I was
25 I was alone at home in bed talking on the phone. I had all the
lights off
except for the bathroom light. I had the bathroom door closed but I had
it open
just a crack so I could at least see the outline of the things in my
room. I
don't like complete darkness. Anyway I was in deep conversation then
all of a
sudden I felt something brush against my arm. It caught my attention,
but I
just figured my hair had fallen off my shoulder and brushed against my
arm. I
had very long hair. Then I remembered I had just cut my hair to
shoulder length
that day. I turned and looked. I saw a small figure almost like a
shadow
standing between my bed and my door. Then it ran out of my room. It
scared me
so bad that I couldn't even talk. I just sat there and couldn't say
anything. I
believe it was a spirit of a little girl. After that stranger things
happened,
but I wasn't afraid anymore. I tried to keep it from my 6 year old
daughter,
but She figured it out too. She had been playing with her Barbie's in
her room
I came and got her so we could go to the store. When we got back she
went back
to her room and then came straight back out and said " mama did you put
all the shoes on my Barbie's?"I though what? Since when do you have all
the shoes to your Barbie's?? I figured it was time to tell my daughter
about
the spirit. My boyfriend at the time was abusive. I was stuck in an
abusive
relationship and was in despair. One day he was leaving for work and he
couldn't find his wallet. He had put it were he always put it. We found
it in
the bottom of a drawer. A couple of times he would be missing one shoe
and we
couldn't find them anywhere. I realized that this little spirit did not
like my
boyfriend at all. She was deliberately messing with him. I actually
grew very
fond of her and was sad to leave that house.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I have so many more stories. Some are too scary for me to
repeat. I have
seen many things, but I have never been touched like that.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">My
story
is not very long it was just when i was younger we had lived in a
duplex. Over
our time there we had ended up living in both sides, and it started in
the
first side. We only had one experience in that side, and by we it was
just me
and my mom. One day we had come home and my mom always had a clock
radio in the
bathroom to listem to music in the shower. So we came home from school
and work
i was about 5 or 6 at the time and the power chord had been ripped out
of the
radio but it was still plugged into the wall and the radio hadnt moved
at all.
It was on a small ledge so it would have fallen off if somethin had
bumped it.
That was the only one in that side but when we moved to the other side
we had
alot more experiences. And i have always been into thoes ghost hunter
shows and
most haunted shows. So one night i was layin in bed watchin tv and i
heard the
bathroom sink turn on and i thought it was just my mom in there so i
looked up and
there was no light coming from the bathroom so i went in my moms room
and she
was still asleep. I went and shut it off and went back to my room and
prolly
about 10 or 15 minutes later it was back on again. After that i just
left it,
another time my mom and i were both sleeping and the living room tv
turned on.
It was downstairs from us and the volume was turned all the way up but
it wasnt
on a channel just static so we went downstairs and turned it off then
it came
back on and shut its self off about 3 or 4 times. The final one was my
mom had
just got out of the shower and went into her room to get dressed for
work and i
was still sleeping. She opened her closet door and all her clothes were
on the
floor hangers and all we had no idea how it had happened i wasnt even
tall
enough to reach the rack. After that we had deciced to move out of
there i am
now 19 just moved to idaho and i have a facination with ghosts, haunted
places
etc.. so if you know of any around idaho coeur d'alene or spokane area
let me
know about them please and i hope u like my story<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">I
worked
at a local nursing home as a CNA for about 3 months before I was put on
a night
shift which runs from about 10 p.m. till 5:30 a.m.. I had never worked
the
shift before and was very new to the job. I had started my first rounds
at
midnight when the first insident occured. On the night shift there is
one LPN
and two CNAs. I had put my linen cart at the far end of my hallway so
that I
could do bed checks and pass linen at the same time. I had forgotten my
check
off list at the nurses station so I walked back to get it. At the time
we had a
resident in the process of passing away and when I got near her room I
began to
hear a radio, or so I thought. I went to investigate to see who had
turned on
the radio or TV, I went room by room and found none on but still could
hear
people talking as if through a radio. Not a single person was up or
conscience
when I went checking. I never did find the sorse of the voices, but
when I
neared the dieing womans room they would stop. Finally I gave up and
went to
get my paper. I asked the nurse if she had ever heard or saw anything
that
could explain the sounds I heard and she hadn't. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">I
had been
talking to my nurse for about 5 minutes when the second insident
happend that
night. My linen cart at the far end of the hall suddenly crashed and
flew about
5 feet down the hall. I thought a resident had gotten up and tripped on
my
cart, so I rushed down (as well as my nurse) to the end of the hall and
we
found no resident or any evedence that one had even woke up. As my
nurse and I
started cleaning up the now dirty linens off the floor, we both heard
the
strange disconnected voices coming from an unknown sorce. I whispered
to my
nurse that that was what I had heard before. We both got up and
searched this
time thinking that one of the residents was pulling pranks on us, but
again we
found no sorse or anyone from which the occurances came from. By this
time I
was so freaked out that I wanted to go home. I even asked the other CNA
to come
help me finish up so that I was not alone. We both heard the voices
several
times throughout the night.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">After
that
night, I rarely would work the night shift when someone was passing
away. It seemed
that when they were, something was there. I had, however, worked a
night when a
woman suddenly died when I was giving care to her. This was my first
sight of
death. When the woman passed, I called my nurse in and started
preparing her to
be taken to the morge when all of a sudden her pictures fell from the
bureau
and the curtains started to flutter. The nurse helping me jumped up and
opened
the window and the russlening stopped at once. She later explained to
me that
what had happend occured frequently if the window wasn't open to allow
the
persons spirt to leave. After that night I refused with my full power
to never
work nights again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Though
I
stopped working nights I still had encounters durring the day. They
were less
frequent and no where near as frightening, but there none the less. I
took care
of a resident who was very sick off and on, who on her bad days would
sit in
her room and swivel her head back and forth calling out to the angels
that
stayed in her room. At times she would shreek out saying that there
were ones
who told her they wanted her dead. At first I thought this was just a
product
of her medications, but one day when I went to comfert her. I sat on
the edge
of her bed near the middle of the bed when suddenly I felt every hair
on my body
stand up and turn extreamly cold even though the whole building was
nearly 90
degrees. The lady turned her head to me and politly asked me to move
further
down so that her sister could continue speaking to her. Her sister had
died
when she was 15. I quickly removed myself from the room and did not
enter the
room for several hours. There were also the unexplained cold areas all
through
the place, many would shift if you brushed near but most froze you to
the spot.

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">I
know
that these will not be my last experiances being a nurse. I have worked
at
several nursing homes in the last years to know that I will never get
over the
sudden scary chills when I see someone from the corner of my eye, or
feel the
sudden chill pass through me, but these are the most unbeliveable
experiances I
have so far. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">I
don't
know if I'm crazy or not and I'm not sure about what I saw, but from
what I've
been told <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">it
was a
ghost. I'm a junior at a really small high school school in Illinios.
My school
is really old <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">and
it
used to be a boarding school for little kids. It is currently used as a
high
school and there is <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">a
convent
where many nuns live in the north wing. My teacher knows I'm
interesting in
ghosts <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">and
stuff,
so she always tells me about her experiences inside our school. My
teachers
office is <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">right
next
to the bathroom where my sighting occured. She told me stories about
kids who
were <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">in
here
class. She said that two of her students who were working in her office
with
her felt <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">tappins
on
their sholders; when they turned around, no on was there. One girl even
screamed one <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">time
and
the other teachers came running into her room. When my teacher is in
her
office, she <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">says
that
she always feels like someone is standing behind her and that someone
is
watching her. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Now
to my
story. One day, about 4 weeks ago, during a boring physics class, I
decided to
go to <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">the
bathroom. I didn't really have to go, so I decided to do my hair. While
I was
looking in the <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">mirror,
I
saw a white puff of smoke comming out from above one of the stalls. As
soon as
I <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">turned
to
get a better look, I heard a quant sneeze comming from the direction of
the
stalls. Now, <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">this
bathroom is very big, there are about 15 stalls in a row. I thought
someone
might be smoking <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">in
one of
the stalls, so I decided to walk down the row of stalls and look in
each one.
No one <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">was
there.
Now I started to remember what my teacher had told me about how she
thought the
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">school
was
haunted, so I walked by her classroom. She didn't have a class at the
time, so
I went <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">into
her
room and told her what I saw. She said that the bathroom that I was in
used to
have <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">bathtubs
in them so the kids at the boarding school could take baths. She isn't
sure if
something <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">happened
in the bathroom, or in a room near the bathroom, but she said that
there
shouldn't have <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">been
smoke
comming from the stalls. There are no vents above the stalls and no
windows
above <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">the
stalls. There is, however, a door at the other end of the bathroom. One
door
lets you in the <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">bathroom,
one door leads to the teachers office, and the other is where the maids
to the
nuns <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">laundry.
(My school also has a convent at the other end of it. A priest fell
down the
stairs and <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">died
in
2006 and many nuns have died in the school, but we don't believe that
this is
the ghost of <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">the
priest
or the nuns.) The only explanation that we could think of for the
smokey object
was <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">steam
from
one of the washers/dryers, but my teacher checked and they weren't on
at the
time. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">I'm
not
sure if what I saw was a ghost or not, my dad did see a ghost in my old
house
so I am a <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">believer,

walk by <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">I
grew up
in Memphis but now live in Atoka, TN. I have had several &#8220;ghost<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>experiences &#8220;<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>the first when I was 4 or 5 years old. My parents were older and
my
grandparents were deceased prior to my birth. However,<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I suffered from nightmares and one night I
was awakened by someone sitting on my bed. When I opened my eyes I saw
a man in
a plaid bathrobe and silver hair. He was just looking at me. I looked
back and
was not afraid until he stood and vanished as he walked from the room.
I
screamed and it took my mother hours to calm me after I told her what I
saw.
Many years later we were talking about my childhood nightmares and this
one
came up. My mother got very quiet and when I asked why she told me that
the man
I saw in my &#8220;nightmare&#8221; and had described to her at such a young age
was her
father who had passed when she was 23 years old. I<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>suppose my grandfather just wanted to see the
youngest child of his youngest daughter. He was of Scottish<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>descent and loved his plaids. She said I
described his favorite robe that he wore in the last years of his life
so she
knew for certain it was him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Many
years
later I married and moved to Atoka to a new house built on land that was<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>fields and pasture. I have had<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>a few encounters with a shadow type ghost in
my home and the feeling of being watched. Once in daylight I was at my
sink
looking out side and thought my husband had come in the house and was
standing
behind me to wash his hands as he is prone to do. When I spoke to him
nobody
was there. I went outside to ask if he had just been in the house and
he was
under the car changing the oil and thought I was joking. Needless to
say I said
a few prayers although I never felt any danger I want the spirits to
have
peace. My son-in-law is interested in Indian lore and has found out
that the
area we live in was at one time inhabited by Indians and he thinks the
building
of the neighborhood has bothered them in some way.In the 11 years since
we
moved in either I have adapted to them or vice/versa because I have had
fewer
experiences as time passes. My husband still teases me about &#8220;my ghost&#8221;.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">This
story
took place just about 9 years ago, and I distinctively remember over
here in
malt <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">there
seemed to be some campaign about cancer awareness, especially breast
cancer
amongst <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">women.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">I
would
not say that Malta is a backward country then again it is not one of
the most
advanced <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">regarding
these matters. And how I remembered the events that took place? Well
how could
I <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">ever
forget them?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">I
remember
one evening, while I watching the TV with the wife and kids there was
some <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">woman
who
was sharing her cancer experience and how important it was for women to
have <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">regular
screening, or self examination when it came to checking for any signs
of breast
cancer. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Well
just
like anyone else, this kind of stuck into my wife&#8217;s head and after the
program<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">My
wife
thought it would a good idea if she went for an examination, just to be
on what
you <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">might
call
the safe side?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Over
a
week had passed bye and I had forgotten all about that evening, only
when I got
home <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">from
work
that day I found my wife in the kitchen looking quite worried about
something.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;"><span
 style="">&nbsp;</span>Well naturally I ask her what was the matter;
she hesitated then told me she had found quite a <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">large
lump
on the side of one her breast. (Well this may sound funny or kind of
rude, but
really <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">it&#8217;s
not
something anyone in their right mind would want to joke about)<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">The
next
day we made an appointment, to see our family doctor, who also happened
to be a
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">woman
which kind of brought some sort of relief to my wife. However, after a
careful <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">examination
the outcome concluded our worst fears, that there defiantly was
something there
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">and
my
wife was referred to a specialist in our local hospital. Were he also
concluded
after <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">having
an
examination and a mammogram, that they would have to perform a biopsy,
just to <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">see
if the
lump was cancerous or not, and to take matters from there.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;"><span
 style="">&nbsp;</span>Well that was all we needed to hear even
though the doctor did his best to try and reassure us <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">that
this
could just be a harmless cyst and not to jump to conclusions. Then
again I
guess it does <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">not
really
matter what someone tells you, because you always hear of these stories
were <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">someone
went into hospital just for something normal, just to find out they
that their
results <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">came
back
positive for cancer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">My
wife&#8217;s
minor sugary was scheduled for two weeks time and every evening she
would check
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">to
see if
the lump at the side of her breast was still there, forever hoping it
would
just vanish on <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">its
own.
However, this never happened and I felt helpless, sorry for her and
gave her
whatever <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">kind
of
support that I could. Only what can you say or do but then again I knew
I had
to do <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">something.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">It
was the
night before she was due to go into hospital and I could hear my wife
crying in
bed <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">frightened
from what the outcome of tomorrows surgery would be. I did my best to
comfort
her <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">until
finally she fell asleep and as for me well thoughts went through my
mind.
Should I pray to <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">god?
But
then again I am not religious so why if he did exist would he listen to
me,
when I don&#8217;t <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">even
go to
church and can&#8217;t even remember the last time I even said a pray for
that
matter. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">However,
just the same I thought I would give it a try anyway.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">I
placed
my hand just underneath, where the lump, cyst whatever you want to call
it was.
I then <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">closed
my
eyes and cleared my mind, I ask god to help me to heal my wife and to
remove
her <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">suffering
and at the same time focused on transferring my strength to her. I
brought
pictures <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">into
my
head of the energy flowing through my body, down my arm and to the palm
of my <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">hand.
I
could feel some strange sensation; a glow of warmth came upon me. All
of this
lasted <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">for
barely
3 minutes. And for some reason I felt exhausted and fell asleep.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">The
following morning we arrived at the hospital and my wife was taken into
a large
ward. I <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">was
told
since it was not visiting hours and the doctors were scheduled to make
their
rounds <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">soon
and
that I could not stay for long. So I gave my wife a big hug and asked
the nurse
if she <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">could
phone me if anything happened or for whatever reason that might have
came to
mind.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;"><span
 style="">&nbsp;</span>Well after just a few hours the phone at home
rang, it was the nurse from the hospital and she <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">told
me
that I could come and collect my wife?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Wow
that
was quick I said to myself and drove straight to the hospital which was
not
that far <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">away.
I
had only just reached the main gates and I could see my wife running
towards
our car <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">with
a big
smile on her face. I pulled over to the side to let her get in and
asked how it
all went. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Well
to my
surprise she said &#8220;it did not go any were the doctors examined me and
even took
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">another
scan only they could not find anything?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I was dammed sure that last night before I <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">went
to
bed that I could still feel that the lump was still there. Now isn&#8217;t
that
strange she <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">continued
saying?&#8221; And since that day I have never told her anything about what
happened
that <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">night
.
And as for believing in god, well I guess there are some strange forces
working
out <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">there,
only whatever they are only god knows who ever that might be?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">It
was one
long night in 1999 when i had just woken up from the worst nightmare.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">I
was only
seven years old at the time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I didn't
know if ghosts were real or not and i honestly didn't even care, the
word
ghosts just never went through my head.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">slowly
opening my eyes i hear a very but very thin squeaking coming from the
living
room, so as the little girl that i was i sit up and climb down my bed,<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>but just when i did that i gasped and almost
turned purple because this time i started to hear my mom's old rocking
chair
screech in the living room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So there i
go back up my bed to grab my favorite pillow, and get down and walk all
the way
to my door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">I
open my
bedroom door and look straight up at the hallway and its all pitch
black i
can't see anything. But i soon as i peek out to the right of my bedroom
to
checkout the living room the squeaking sound completely disappears. I
screamed
my mom's name but she wouldn't wake up, i wasn't able to see anything
so what i
did was that i put the pillow that i was holding in my hands on my
right side
of me thinking that no one or anything could harm me.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>So i start walking across the hallway towards
my moms room and thats when i started to hear that old rocking chair
squeaking
again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This time i was so tired and
scared that i just threw my pillow on the floor and forgot about my
mom, so i
started walking towards the hallway again and turn left to the living
room and
i stayed still.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is nothing again
no noise, no squeaking ,no rocking chair.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I felt that something was just playing around with me,<span
 style="">&nbsp; </span>and thats when everything for some reason
starts getting easier to see, everything either started to get clear or
my
vision got really used to the dark.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I
actually started to feel happy instead of scared.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
rocking chair<span style="">&nbsp; </span>appeared out of the blue
again and moved
slowly and then moved at a faster paste and it felt like it was calling
me to
get closer and closer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The closest that
i would get the faster the rocking chair move,<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>and it made that weird noise again.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I stopped getting closer and i was already in the middle of the
living
room and as soon as i stopped getting closer is when the the chair
completely
stopped and almost flew up and towards me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">I
really
don't understand how there was so much noise going on and no one heard
it but
me.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was actually a very cool
experience it didn't feel too scary and whatever it was it didn't try
to harm
me at all for except when the chair almost flew over me, but it didn't
so it
was all okay.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">The
next
day i didn't want to tell my mom because i was scared that she wouldn't
believe
me, and because i was little i was only seven so i ended up telling my
little
sister about it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My mom heard me telling
my sister<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and she got mad and told me to
stop telling her lies that would scare her.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I got mad but till this day she still doesn't believe me and its
been
more than ten years that that happened to me and i know for sure that
it was
real and not a dream.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So all those
people out there who have stories and their family and friends don't
believe
you its ok because there are a lot of people in this world that go
through
similar situations and some people just don't believe until they see or
experience.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>AND THAT'S OKY DOKy!!!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">Hi!
I have
read most of embedded stories in shadowlands and i decided to share
with my
own. I <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">have
lived
in old train station house for two years. In this house one man was
burned
alive and <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">one
have
commited suicide or killed (no one knows excatly). When my family and i
moved
in <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">most
of
rooms (there were three rooms) were messed up. It took while to clean
and sort
them up. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">One
room
where previous dweller lived who has burned alive was damaged an from
first day
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">when
i
went in this room i had that strange feeling of being watched and
feeling of
uneasiness. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">My
mother
told us to walk through all rooms with smouldering juniper branch in
hands to
clean <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">the
rooms
spiritually. We did that. Two months later i had my first weird
occurancy. I
forgot to <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">mention
that we lived in second floor. Below us was one big room and two
smaller ones.
It <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">happened
at 4:30 at night. I was watching tv when i heard strange noise in 1st
floor
right below <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">me.
In our
kitchen we had one broken faucet (it couldn`t be turned shut totally so
water
is <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">dripping
about
1 drop per 2 seconds). That noise sounded like someone was banging to
the <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">ceiling
in
first floor. Banging was almost sinchronized with water dripping.
Banging
lasted about <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">2
minutes
and then it stopped. Of course i got scared and turned tv volume louder
and
tried to <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">go
sleep
with my tv on. In the morning i went down to investigate, but i quickly
realized that <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">door
was
locked and key was being kept by my neighbour who lived next to me so
noone
could <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">enter
in
1st floor. I got the key and went to take a look. In first floor noone
has
entered for 2 <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span style="font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;">years.
All
was dusty and abandoned. I couldn`t see any footprints on the floor.
And
ceiling was <o:p></o:p></span></p>
