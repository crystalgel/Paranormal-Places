<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>"Little
things throughout my life" </big></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>By:

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>Man..where
should I begin..I guess from the beginning. OK. I will start off by
saying I am
very interested in the paranormal and I am believer in my Lord and
Savior Jesus
Christ. Just wanted to put that out there. OK, here goes..the first
"experience" I guess you can say that I remember in particular was
when I was around 4 years old in 1990. I remember lying in bed one
night with
my "Child's Play 2" doll just before I went to bed. When I awoke I
looked over in my closet and my doll was in there laying flat on my
huge heap
of other stuffed animals. I cannot explain this. I was no sleep-walker
- I
don't think. My mom and dad were down the hall in their room with my
sister
(infant) in her crib sleeping. To this day, I cannot explain this.
Maybe one of
them came into my room to check on me and saw my doll on the floor and
decided
to put it in the closet. IDK.&nbsp;&nbsp; Another
experience happened a few years later, I think I was around 6 or 7 in
1992-1993. My parents had separated, I was living with my dad and my
sister my
mom. Anyways, my dad and I had gone over to "visit" my mom and sister
(now living in a new apartment) and I remember my dad going upstairs
and me
staying downstairs. I had been sitting on a couch downstairs just idle
and I
decided to walk across the living to this couch on the other side. I
then, for
some odd reason get on my knees and stick my hand under the couch and
pull at
the threads. Once I pulled a part a piece of thread from under the
couch I
looked at it and I remember this just like it happened yesterday. There
was a
shiny black piece of mesh like string in my left hand (palm flat) and
all of a
sudden it vanished right before my eyes! It did not fall out of my
hand, blow
away or no such thing..I saw it vanish slowly. The next thing
occurrence
happened when I was about 7 or 8 in 1993-94. I was still living with my
dad in
a house we'd just lived in (built in the 1980s). Anyways, it was night
time and
I was in my room lying in bed. I had bunked beds and that were
perpendicular to
each other. I was in the bottom bunk and being a scary little boy as I
was at
the time (still am at times) I had built a tent with my covers, pulling
them
down so that I couldn't see outwards and nothing could see me. The only
openings were to sides of the top bunk which was lifted and to the far
left the
bed was inches away from the wall so only a small person could squeeze
through
and on the right was a lot more space for which you could walk.
Anyways. I was
lying there with my night light on and all of a sudden I hear footsteps
enter
my room in which I followed with my eyes if that makes sense. I
remember my
head turning and following the footsteps and they slowly crept across
the foot
of my bed which I couldn't see. They were making their way to the right
side of
my bunk where there was more walking space and uncovered. So
whatever/whoever
it was, I would see it soon. As soon as the fear in me rose to a
maximum it
stopped near the right edge of my bed right after it had turned the
corner. I
was so relieved. The next morning I went down stairs and asked my dad,
who was
the only other person in the house that night, if he had come in my
room last
night, he said no. I cannot explain that. The next thing occurred a
night or so
later if I can recall. I was lying in my bed, sleepless and scared as
usual.
But this time, I was lying on the opposite end of my bed exposed to
everything.
I remember my dad was out in the opening where the hallway bathroom was
- right
in front of the top of the stairs. Anyways, right before he went to his
room or
downstairs - can't remember &nbsp;which, I
told him to leave the bathroom light on and the door cracked. I then
remember
lying there looking up and out of my room with an upside down view of
the
hallway. Then moments later after I had just closed my eyes..I got that
feeling
of being watched and it was coming from the hallway. I didn't look out
into the
hallway and even though my eyes were closed I could tell the lights
were still
on because I didn't get that flicker when they go off. Anyways, all of
a sudden
a "gust or force" came rushing into my room and on top of me,
inhumanly fast! I instantly opened my eyes to nothing being there and
looked
out into the hallway - nothing there. I cannot &nbsp;explain this.
&nbsp;&nbsp;I actually need to go back a few years to
when I was about 5 or 6 in 1991-92 when I was living &nbsp;at my
grandparents (dads parents) house before
my dad bought his house. Anyways, I had just &nbsp;seen the movie "It"
sometime before
and I was lying in bed in one of my grandparents rooms &nbsp;alone.
There's a huge window in the room which
was right in front of me and even though it had &nbsp;curtains
up..there was a corner of the window
on the right side that was exposed and I you could &nbsp;clearly see
out. Anyways, I remember waking up
in the middle of the night and looking straight &nbsp;into that corner
of the window and seeing
"It" the clown up against the corner of the the house (this room was
the last on this side of the house) with his arms folded and starring
right at
me with a sneaky evil grin on his face as if he has been starring at me
for
hours. But he was outside the window. I remember that dull orange glow
from the
nearest streetlight and his face! I was scared out of my mind..I never
looked
his way again and I screamed - when I could "Grandma!!!!!
Grandma!!!!!" And ran into my grandparents room and slept on their
floor
the rest of the night. I'd also like to mention that this window is at
least
10-15 ft up from where I could see his upper body, with nothing you
connected
to the house for you to stand on. I cannot explain this. OK...to skip
ahead
some years..when I was about 17-18 years old in 2003-04 I was living
with my
mom and I was lying in bed one night and I had the covers over my head,
then
all of a sudden I hear this voice say "Try again" It sounded just
like my dad's voice, but it couldn't have been him because he wasn't
there. I
really think this was God talking to me and not paranormal at all, I
just
thought I'd mention it. Alright..a few years later in the summer of
2007 when I
was 20, the most evident paranormal activity occurred to me. I was
living with
my dad that summer in the same house from before and I tell you I just
felt
like he and I weren't there only ones there. Anyways, things I remember
from my
time there at summer was the feeling someone was watching me from the
hallways
of other rooms, getting scents of aromas out of nowhere, as if
"someone" had just passed by, hearing small noises (some sounding
like small chatter). Anyways, one early morning I was lying in bed and
awoke to
hearing my dad getting ready to head out to work. It was about
2:30-3:30 A.M.
and I heard my dads vehicle crank up, pull out the driveway and then
drive up
the street. Well, then the real activity began. I remember my door
being
completely shut when I looked at it before my dad left the house. As I
lay in
bed not even a minute after I heard my dad pull away I hear and feel a
"force" rush into my room. The same room from when I was younger in
this house. It stopped at the foot of my bed. I had frozen with fear
and I
couldn't open my eyes. I remember wanting and trying to say outloud
"What" (5x), but couldn't. Then with my eyes still closed this
"force" does the same thing again and gets beside my bed. I then am
just losing it with fear, but gets the courage to just will myself
upright and
open my eyes with my arm going up first as if I was drowning with fear
being
the water and me trying to get to the surface. Anyways, when I opened
my eyes,
I saw nothing and I didn't go back to sleep the rest of the morning.
When the
house was lighted by the sun I went downstairs, still home alone, for
some
food. When I came back up to my room, I looked down at the foot of my
door and
found a piece of material which I recognized from the attic. Then I
payed even
closer attention to it and noticed it was folded to show the word
"Help." The word was not written however, it was a word printed on
the material, but just folded to show the word "Help." Right after I
noticed this, I smelled the perfume I'd smelled a before. I was
freaking
baffled. I had no idea what was going on. I had a talk with my dad
about this
and see "says' he never had any experiences in the house. I left a few
days afterwords.&nbsp; **I would like to
mention that these were just a few things that stick out in my mind
that have
happened to me. All throughout my life there have been times where I
thought I
saw something out the corner of my eye where I shouldn't have, or heard
noises
when nothing was around to make them. I've also had dreams...save that
for a
later time. I've found unexplainable markings (scars, scratches and
scrapes) on
my body after waking up in the morning. I'm 23 now and this stuff has
been
happening all my life. After 2007, when I prayed that this stuff would
stop..its died down a lot. But I still get that feeling of being
watched or
touched every once in a while.** </big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>Me
and my husband just put a addition on our house about 10 years ago with
slot of
digging for our foundation for our new house and one night after a few
months
of renovations I was asleep and my dog started barking I was wide awake
right
now and looked at the direction my dog was barking at and froze in
terror and
saw a 5 foot tall shadow&nbsp; being that
walked from our bathroom into my dressor and disappeared.&nbsp;&nbsp; I
have never forgotten this incident.&nbsp; It was fully dimensional
black mass in human
form.&nbsp; another night me and my father
heard a bunch of people talking we both looked outside and nobody was
there
about two am at night.&nbsp; I found out this
land was a potatoe farm before the land was developed and also
frequented by
native Americans in earlier times.&nbsp; other
stuff has happened as well but no where as sureal.&nbsp; I am a skeptic
though do believe in another
realm of existance and have tried to debunk these things but can't find
any
explanation.</big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>A
few years back my husband (@ the time) had a sister dying from brain
cancer..One morning for no apparent reason while we were sitting in the
kitchen
with our coffee, we heard a crash come from the bedroom,as we entered
the
bedroom found a large picture had slid down the wall to the floor, but,
oddly
enough, the glass in the frame hadn't smashed on impact, nor, was the
hook on
which it had been hung, disturbed,we looked at one another in amazement
,
exchanged puzzled looks, shook our heads, made the comment, "that was
strange" hung the picture back up &amp; headed back to the
kitchen...minutes later, a musical roller that we had our toilet tissue
on,
started playing a tune, the odd thing about this is that the tissue
needed to
be tugged to rotate the roller in order for the tune to be played...No
one was
near that roller nor had the tissue been disturbed...Within the hour we
had
received a call from Texas informing us that Susie had passed on.We
believe
that these were signs from Susie &amp; she just had to pull these
tricks off on
us to get our attention.&nbsp; </big></big></p>

Family Cabin</big></big></p>

blake.henderson91@yahoo.com&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</big></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I
awoke in the middle of the night/early morning. Not sure what time, but
it had
to be around 12am-2pm. But anyways when I woke up it was mainly because
the
discomfort of the crappy little air mattress we had, I went down the
stairs and
got something to drink and started watching tv in the front room. The
front
room is kinda creepy, but I&#8217;m not really scared of it. It is a big box
room
connected with the kitchen in the cabin, the front and back door are in
this
room, and it has three huge windows on each wall, none of them had
blinds. So
could get the feeling your being watched at night when you&#8217;re in that
room. So
anyways I knew everyone was asleep because I heard them snoring in the
back
room where some bunk beds are. . All of a sudden when I&#8217;m watching my
movie a
light shines across the floor coming from one of the windows. I wasn&#8217;t
clueless
about what the light was, I knew what it was. Out in front of the
cabin, we
have a small shed we put our 4-wheelers and stuff in. and it has two
huge doors
in front of it.. That are always closed when no ones in there. Anyways,
I
looked out the window and seen that the two doors were wide open, and
the light
was on. I went to the backroom and woke my dad up telling him that I
think
someone was in our shed maybe stealing something because the light was
on. When
he finally got up and we went into the front room the light was gone,
and when
we shined the flashlight on the shed, the doors were closed. We turned
on the
porch light and went and checked it out to make sure no one stole
anything or
to see if anyone was hanging around there, etc. No signs of anyone, and
nothing
was gone. I told him that I knew what I saw, and that the doors were
open and
the light just came on in the middle of me watching tv.. He didn&#8217;t
really believe
me. We both went to bed.&nbsp; In the morning,
we checked out by the shed to look for footprints or anything..nothing.
So we
spent the rest of the day there and went home. I didn&#8217;t know what to
think. I
know what happened but I thought it was someone, not a ghost or nothing
like
that, but maybe a trespasser or something. A few months later me and my
uncle
went to the cabin to go hunting together, this was my first time I had
been
there since the night the light from the shed came on.&nbsp; We both
got ready to go hunting, and we both
split up on separate 4-wheelers. The land is pretty big, we have
atleast 4
different tree stands throughout the area. He went to one stand and I
went to
the other. Pretty good distance away from each other. So anyways, I sat
in the
stand, and seen a deer walk out. I couldn&#8217;t get a shot, because the
branches
were in the way.. But I could still look at it, so I did. It eventually
turned
his head and kept doing so like something was behind it or it was
hearing
things.. It then started running off.. I didn&#8217;t hear a thing that could
have
scared it. After that, I didn&#8217;t see anything and it was about 9am in
the
morning, so I started heading back on the 4-wheeler.&nbsp; Through the
woods, while driving on the
path.. I swore I seen something behind a tree. Looked like a black
shirt or
some type of cloth behind a tree. Then I look up and it was gone. It
was a good
enough view to make me thing. Whatever it was, it was pretty wide,
because it
stuck out a little from both sides of the tree. I didn&#8217;t stop to check
it out,
I kept going.. But def. had me thinking what would it have been.
Nothing else
happened irregular during my stay that day/night. The last thing that
has
happened was about 2 years ago I was at the cabin with my parents just
spending
the weekend there. Normal day. But at night, I woke up from the
upstairs loft
to the sound of a bell ringing. Not a big bell or anything, kind of
sounded
like a cow bell. I kept hearing it.. It sounded to close and clear to
be
outside.. Sounded like it was downstairs. When I went downstairs, my
mom was in
the kitchen area lighting a candle saying that she heard the same exact
noise..
But she said it sounded like it was up stairs&#8230; Somewhere from me and my
mom
talking the bell ringing stopped, and we didn&#8217;t hear nothing &nbsp;the
rest of the night&#8230; From my knowledge.. We
don&#8217;t have a bell anywhere in the cabin or around it&#8230; and we wouldn&#8217;t
need
one&#8230;. So we had no idea where the sound was coming from.&nbsp; This
point, not going to lie.. I started
getting scared of the cabin, and this experience is what started making
me
think that maybe all these experiences at the cabin might be ghost
related.
Ever since then, I have been to the cabin a few times, but nothing has
happened. But yeah, I think that maybe the whole land and the cabin may
be
somewhat haunted&#8230; I don&#8217;t go hunting there anymore because Im so
freaked out to
be in the woods by myself over there. And I have &nbsp;asked most of my
family members who normally
go to that cabin, no one has ever had anything &nbsp;odd happen to
them.. So far it&#8217;s just me and
my mom who have noticed anything weird. </big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>The
Man With The Wagon.</big></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>&nbsp;</big></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
jamesaxbrice@msn.com</big></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>&nbsp;</big></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>This
is my second story of a strange, and terrifying, event which took place
by my
house on Park St., Nacogdoches Texas.&nbsp; I
had two brothers who shared "the boys room" with me, but my oldest
brother was in Vietnam when this took place, I believe the year was
1968.&nbsp; My brother and I each had the heads of our
beds against separate windows that looked down upon Park Street from
the second
floor.&nbsp; Our street had the old carbon
light bulbs during that time which are so famous in so many old
thriller
movies. The light would shine brightly down, but in the area between
light
posts, it was almost totally dark; not like our modern street lights in
the least.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My brother and I would often lay on our
stomachs and look out the windows onto the dark street while we talked,
often
until we fell asleep.&nbsp; One night I was
looking out the window, my chin on my fists, and I felt my eyes grow
heavy and
sleep coming on strongly.&nbsp; A period of
time passed, I have no idea how much, when I heard "tok tok tok tok"
heading down our street from town towards the black neighborhood by our
house
which ended in a dirt road by the river.&nbsp;
This was in the sixties when black and white people were much more
segregated than today.&nbsp; Soon enough,&nbsp; I saw a young,
twenty-something looking black
lady walking down the street in a mini-skirt and high, tight boots
(quite
common in the sixties for young women).&nbsp;
I noticed as she passed underneath one of the harsh street lights that
she was quite attractive....I was only nine, and even at that age she
made
quite an impression on me.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As she
passed the house quickly I again felt my eyelids grow heavy and sleep
coming
when I heard a distant rumbling and squeaking sound coming, much slower
than
the woman, down the street headed in the same direction as the woman.&nbsp;
In the shadow and lighting I saw a heavy-set
old black man with a dingy brimmed hat, and a very wrinkly cotton suit.
His
snow-white gray hair stuck out from beneath the old hat.&nbsp; It
looked as if the suit, at one time, had
been snow-white,&nbsp; but was now a dirty
brown.&nbsp; The noise he made came from a
large, red metallic wagon he was pulling...an empty wagon.&nbsp; Once
again my eyes became heavy and I drifted
into sleep.&nbsp; &nbsp;As before, some unknown amount of time passed
when I heard the shrill scream of a woman from fairly far off...this
wakened me
to full awareness...I listened carefully, and about ten to fifteen
minutes
later I once again heard the rumbling, bumping and squeaking wagon
coming back
toward town.&nbsp; From out of the shadows to
my left,&nbsp; the black man emerged pulling
his wagon, but there was something in it.&nbsp;
When he passed from darkness to the harsh light of the street light
directly in front of my view I saw what his cargo was.&nbsp; It was the
limp body of the woman I had seen
pass by earlier.&nbsp; It was then that I
noticed the man had slowed to a crawl, then stopped completely beneath
the
street light.&nbsp; He was looking straight
down the street and he quickly turned his head and looked not at my
house, but
directly into my window...directly at me.&nbsp;&nbsp;
His face was emotionless and completely lit from forehead to chin.&nbsp;
The terror became complete when I realized
that this man "stared" at me with black empty sockets where his eyes
should have been.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I rolled off the bed
and screamed loudly, but only a harsh squeak came out.&nbsp; I shook my
brother awake and told him what
I'd seen, and he told me I had had a nightmare, and to turn on the
light for a
while and read or something.&nbsp; I was
covered in sweat, and believed my brother's explanation completely, but
something immediately made the hairs on my arms rise and my heart
hammer.&nbsp; I jumped back on the bed and squinted as hard
as I could to see what was apparently already out of my range.&nbsp; A
rumbling, bumping sound with a squeak that
was, only a few seconds later, gone.&nbsp; If
I had been older I would have checked our local paper to see if a young
woman's
body had been found murdered and dumped somewhere, but it didn&#8217;t even
occur to
me at that age.&nbsp; All I know is that I
have always been able to tell a dream from a wakeful state, and my mind
has
always rejected the idea that I was asleep.&nbsp;
Also, since black people were not treated equally with white people, I
knew that murders sometimes took place against black people which were
never
reported.&nbsp; Now that I write this, I am
prompted to, yet scared to death, to go back through the pages of the
paper and
see what I can find.&nbsp; I am almost afraid
I will find a report of a murdered woman whose body was dumped far from
the
crime scene.&nbsp; Part of me thinks that if I
do find such a story in the paper and realize it happened, then one
night I
will awaken to the sound of a rumbling, squeaky wheeled wagon, but this
time it
will be coming for me. </big></big></p>

Like Shadow </big></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
lbomber13@gmail.com</big></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I
just submitted a recent experience of mine and as I read a story on the
site an
old experience was brought to mind. When I was 14 I was standing
outside my
house around 9 pm waiting for my friend. I am an impatient person and
began to
walk down the street toward the pre-school to see if I could see my
friend
coming up the hill. As I got closer to the school I became aware of a
small
(child-like) black shadow against the fence of the school, but I could
not
clearly make anything out other than a small shape that appeared to be
sitting
on its bottom, &#8220;legs&#8221; pulled up the chest, &#8220;arms&#8221; around the legs and
face
hidden by the arms. As I got closer it picked up its head and pointed
at me and
I have never felt such intense fear in my entire life. This entity was
indeed
completely black with no facial features except for hollow type eye
sockets but
when it looked up at me I knew that it knew that I could see it and
that it
meant me harm, yet I could not move. We both remained there for a solid
10
seconds when it &#8220;took off&#8221; through the fence and proceeded to &#8220;run&#8221;
through the
playground, but all I could see was a light that moved like lightning.
This
&#8220;thing&#8221; terrorized me for a long time after that night lasting at least
4
years. I lived on the second floor and my room connected to the front
hall
where there was a porch. Now and again I would look outside after
feeling
watched and &#8220;it&#8221; would be there looking at me, either peeking over the
rail or
sitting on it and I felt like it was mocking me and enjoying my fear. I
eventually closed my blinds and didn&#8217;t open them again for roughly 4
years as I
was afraid what would happen if I continued to actually see it.
Sometime around
2000 my fear dissipated and I opened my blinds during the day but still
closed
them at night and have never had any other experiences with this
entity. I do
not know what this was but I got the distinct feeling that it was
inhuman. Do
you have any ideas about what this thing could have been and why it
would have
pointed at me with such hate?&nbsp; </big></big></p>

Encounters</big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I
would like to share 3 experiences that I have had in my life. It was my
junior
year in high school, 1994-1995, and I was sound asleep in a twin bed.
The air
felt colder than what my parents kept the house at but I pulled up the
covers.&nbsp; The foot of my bed lifted off
the ground and came down with a hard thump.&nbsp;
I was instantly awake.&nbsp; At the
foot of my bed a figure stood, she was dressed in white and she looked
flowy
for lack of a better word.&nbsp; I did not
feel scared or fear but I felt her loneliness.&nbsp;
I have never experienced her presence again though now being older and
back in my old room with a much greater understanding of paranormality,
I would
like her to revisit me; however, I know opening the door could let evil
in as
well so I am not inclined to invite her back.&nbsp;
In my senior year of high school, 1995-1996, it was sort of a rite of
passage to go in a group several miles out of the city to a dilapidated
house
that was considered haunted.&nbsp; Myself and
3 friends decided to go to this house around 10pm during the month of
September.&nbsp; Then, that house had the shutters askew and
the paint peeling with a not so good feeling emanating from it.&nbsp;
My friends did not believe in spirits or
ghosts but I always have, and upon entering I was overcome by a sense
that we
were NOT welcome.&nbsp; No one else in my
group felt anything.&nbsp; I remember going up
the stairs and with each tread I took, this ominous feeling of despair,
hatred
and fear overcame me to the point I wondered if I was going to be able
to
breathe.&nbsp; Once at the top of the stairs
we began walking down the hall; none of my friends felt anything nor
saw
anything but for me it was a different story.&nbsp;
At the end of the long hallway there was a window and the wood floor
was
scratched badly like a piece of furniture was drug across it.&nbsp; A
dark shadow of a man appeared there and complete
hatred vibrated from him through me.&nbsp; He
did not like nor want us there and he wanted to hurt me for trespassing
in his
home. I believe in different levels of evil and this presence was the
worst I
have ever felt or known up to this time. I told my friends we are
leaving now,
run! They thought I was totally neurotic and stupid for over reacting.&nbsp;
They were the first down the stairs and I was
the last.&nbsp; The shadow man was coming, I
could feel him getting closer and I was terrified to look back to see
how close
he was to me.&nbsp; The 12 stairs or so to the
main level of the house seemed to take an eternity for me and
everything felt
like it was in slow motion.&nbsp; We all ran
out of the front door and it SLAMMED shut behind us with such force it
shook
the windows.&nbsp; We jumped in the car and
sped away and I started to sob uncontrollably.&nbsp;
It took almost an hour for my breathing and heart rate to return to
normal.&nbsp; When I told my friends what I
saw I could not wrap my mind around why he wanted to hurt only me and
not all
of us.In the following months I would drive by that house and I would
get the
feeling that he knew and was watching me and waiting for me to come
back.&nbsp; He wanted me, this evil presence wanted me.&nbsp; The
following year the house was torn down to
make room for a housing development.&nbsp; I
have only driven by one time and the feeling of pure evil is still
there and I
do not envy the persons who live where that house used to stand. This
experience is the most recent that I have had and I do not want to have
it
again.&nbsp; This was an all of a sudden
occurrence and I have never had contact with an apparition render me
motionless
and half frozen before this night. A little background to begin:&nbsp;
The beginning of October 2009 my son was with
his dad, it was his weekend as we&#8217;re divorced.&nbsp;
I do not sleep alone often because my son sleeps with me.&nbsp; He is
afraid of the dark and after his dad
took him to the Dark Knight he doesn&#8217;t want the man with the red face
to get
him so every other weekend I have Saturday night alone.&nbsp; The door
to my room faces north. When you
walk in my room, to the left on the south wall is my dresser and a
small
closet, there is a double bed on the west wall with the foot of the bed
facing
east with a large window on the north wall and closets on the east wall.&nbsp;
It was around 2am on a Saturday night and I
was freezing cold.&nbsp; I thought I was
reaching for my covers and I could not find them nor could I find my
pillow.&nbsp; I was shaking I was so cold and I was in a
half dreamy half awake state and that is when I realized with fright
that I was
about 3 feet off my bed. I was completely alert at that moment; I
couldn&#8217;t move
or make a sound and I remember I could see my breath; it was getting
colder and
colder by the second.&nbsp; I saw a thing in a
bluish mist standing at the foot of my bed.&nbsp;
I could not make out any features because my head ached and I couldn&#8217;t
focus on it. This felt to me like an eternity but it could not have
been more
than 10 minutes total.&nbsp; In my mind I
remember asking God to watch over my son and my parents if something
happened
to me, to protect them and not let this thing harm them.&nbsp; The
apparition made this weird hissing, for
lack of a better word, sound as I was talking to God in my mind and at
that exact
moment I landed outside of my bedroom door. I did not get out of bed
and walk
there myself.&nbsp; At first I was totally
afraid to go back into my room, it was still ice cold.&nbsp; Then I got
angry.&nbsp; I am of Scottish/Irish ancestry and I was
ready to fight and my adrenaline flowed and I walked in there and said
I don&#8217;t
know who you think you are but I don&#8217;t appreciate being woke up like
that!
Shame on you!&nbsp; My back hurt and my
muscles ached from not being able to move and being so cold and I was
not in
the mood to go through that again.&nbsp; It
took several hours before I was warm again and for my breathing to be
normal.&nbsp; I only feel this presence now
when my son is away with his dad on the weekends and I can feel that it
is
livid with me for getting mad at it but nothing of that magnitude has
happened
since that night.&nbsp; I believe that this
entity has been quieter because I have a small cross in my room now
because I
felt that if it hissed at me praying silently to God it would not like
an
actual representation either; it is not openly visible but the meaning
is
there.&nbsp; I truly believe this thing is
more of a demonic presence and meant to do me harm that night. Why else
would I
be completely paralyzed and half frozen 3 feet off my bed? I have done
some
research since this happened and I began to notice that this was after
I had
seen that Paranormal &nbsp;Activity movie and
really began thinking about demonic presences and the like.&nbsp; I
have not studied demonology in depth by any
means, but I do wonder because after this movie I was curious and
sought
answers to my questions and that by reading about all of it, did I let
this
thing in?&nbsp; </big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>Ghost
Followed Me Home From Work One Day </big></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
lilkimber@yahoo.com</big></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I
worked in a law office that was in a 'haunted' building.&nbsp; The
small office complex was built on the
original homestead of the owners of the property.&nbsp; In the 'yard'
at the back of our building,
there was a chimney/fireplace, and the foundation of the homestead. It
was
pretty typical to hear typing on computers in empty offices, and other
strange
noises.&nbsp; Our attorneys frequently
dictated letters and documents, and we even caught an evp or two while
doing
dictation.&nbsp; Overall, though, it was an
extremely warm, welcoming feeling that you got when you were on the
property
and these strange things were fun, never scary.&nbsp;
As I was driving home one day, the radio started changing stations.&nbsp;
I figured it was another thing that was going
wrong w/ my truck at first - just a short in the radio.&nbsp; Then I
started asking it questions.&nbsp; And it answered!!!&nbsp; I'd ask it
to stop changing stations so I
could tell if someone was really there, and it did.&nbsp; If I stopped
talking to it, after a few
minutes it would get irate and change the stations really quickly to
get my
attention.&nbsp; It happened the entire hour
and a half drive home.&nbsp; I was still
talking to this 'entity' while I was sitting in my driveway.&nbsp; I
really hated to get out of the car and
leave it...&nbsp; I was never able to be sure
if this was someone connected to the property, or to me personally.&nbsp;
It's never happened to me again.&nbsp; I don't work in that complex
anymore.&nbsp; I always thought I'd be scared if something
happened to me personally, but honesly, all I could think it "This is
SO
cool!"</big></big></p>

Tales</big></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I
have been in the process of researching paranormal events and studying
demonology.&nbsp; I had some past experiences
and thought maybe you'd be interested in hearing them. I was 10 when my
family
moved to the house my mother currently lives in.&nbsp; I got sick about
2 weeks after the move, and
had a very high fever. &nbsp;This was Summer
of 1991.&nbsp; During that time, I would have
extremely vivid dreams about a little boy, maybe 8 years old.&nbsp; He
wore a blue and yellow rugby shirt, with
dark pants and had brown hair in a bowl cut.&nbsp;
Nothing about the little boy was extraordinary, but the dreams were the
same.&nbsp; He would walk or skip up and down
the hallway, to which my bedroom door was at the head.&nbsp; Sometimes
he had a ball to bounce, other
times he would stand at my doorway and call my name.&nbsp; When I got
better, I told my mom about the
dreams and she dismissed it telling me that fever can make people
hallucinate.&nbsp; Later that year, I started
noticing things that should not have happened.&nbsp;
My family and I went to dinner one night, but I had run back into the
house to get something.&nbsp; I left the light
over the stove on, but the main kitchen light off.&nbsp; There was also
a little basket full of odds
and ends my mom had left over from decorating for Christmas sitting on
the end
of the counter closest to the door.&nbsp; I
set the alarm and closed the door and he left.&nbsp;
When we returned about 2 hours later, I opened the garage door and shut
off the alarm.&nbsp; Now, the garage door
opens up into the laundry room, and you can see directly through to the
other
side of the house, if all other doors are opened.&nbsp; You can see
straight into and through the
kitchen.&nbsp; The main kitchen light was on,
and the basket of Christmas decorations was on the island counter.&nbsp;
When I left the house, it had been on the
opposite counter, closest to the "front" of the kitchen (the kitchen
is at the back of the house).&nbsp; My dad
came in right after me, and asked me why I hadn't turned the kitchen
light
off.&nbsp; I told him I had.&nbsp; The perplexing bit is that when you
drive up
my mom's street, you can see the house clearly, and as most of the
windows only
had minimal coverage, you could see which lights were on.&nbsp; When we
drove up, the kitchen light was
off.&nbsp; Christmas Eve night had my mom's
entire side of the family at our house.&nbsp;
My cousin and I were sitting in the den with a few other people.&nbsp;
Out of the corner of my eye, I saw one of the
candle sticks on the mantle wobble and turned in time to watch it fall
off the
mantle completely.&nbsp; The dust ring from
the candle indicated that there were a solid 3 inches of space in front
of said
stick.&nbsp; There were also little
"nudges" in the dust showing that it wobbled and where.&nbsp; The
nudges in the dust showed the candlestick
scooting forward.&nbsp; The second stick was
still firmly placed on the other ond of the mantle...closest to the
window,
which was closed.&nbsp; The crash attracted
everyone's attention, but my cousin and I were the only ones who saw it
fall.&nbsp; When I was 12, my mom went back to
school.&nbsp; She attended classes at night,
which meant I was home by myself until my dad got home from work.&nbsp;
My dad worked about an hour away, so there
were a few nights that I didn't see either parent before I went to
sleep.&nbsp; One particular night, I was in the bath tub
and I heard what I assumed was my dad open and slam the garage door,
walk into
the kitchen and on up the stairs.&nbsp; He had
a distinct tread and the house accoustics were great for travelling
sound.&nbsp; I yelled a hello from my bath and finished
up.&nbsp; When I got out, I opened the door
expecting to hear the usual "dad" sounds, which in my case were
television and kitchen rummagings.&nbsp;
Imagine my surprise when I opened the bathroom door to silence and a
set
alarm.&nbsp; My dad came home about an hour
later&nbsp; and denied having been home before
that moment.&nbsp; There was a similiar night
that happened right around that time.&nbsp; I
had been painting my nails in my mom's bathroom, alone.&nbsp; The
double door to my parents room was half
closed.&nbsp; The stationary side was bolted
at the top, as was usual.&nbsp; When one walks
across the threshold, their air current makes the door shake a little
and the
floor creaks.&nbsp; This happened as I sat in
my mom's bathroom, alone in the house.&nbsp;
Our house was not very old, but had already settled, and the creaks and
settling sound in the night were like the popping of joints on a person.&nbsp;
This was a defined squeak of floor boards
that happens only when someone walks across the threshold of the door.&nbsp;
My heart started pounding and I asked who was
there.&nbsp; I took a deep breath and peeked around
the corner.&nbsp; No one was there.&nbsp; I expected to walk through a
cold spot, but
there was nothing.&nbsp; It was definitely a
bit unsettling, but by far the least of the happenings to come.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In the interim, I had had a few recurring
dreams, but nothing that warranted me being upset or afraid.&nbsp; Then
my parents bought "The
Couch".&nbsp; This was an art decco
cradle back sofa, forest green with tassles, the whole nine.&nbsp;
Ugly, but also extremely uncomfortable.&nbsp; They set it up in the
living room, against
the windows with a clear view into the front hallway.&nbsp; On the wall
facing out, which was visible
from The Couch was a framed painting of fruit, a knife and a goblet.&nbsp;
The arrangement in the hallway was such that
a wooden secretary was placed against the wall below the painting, and
there
were 2 electirc candlesticks placed on the top of the stand.&nbsp; One
day, about a week after The Couch had
been settled in, there was a crash in the hallway.&nbsp; My mom and I
come running in from other parts
of the house, to find the painting on the floor.&nbsp; The painting
hangs on a wire, and the hook is
an actual hook, not a nail in the wall.&nbsp;
Fairly difficult for that particular painting to have just fallen
off...let alone fallen and missed taking out the electric candlesticks.&nbsp;
This happened for several more months until
The Counch finally managed to break the painting's frame.&nbsp; After
that, we moved the painting from that
wall.&nbsp; The problems stopped after
that.&nbsp; Or those did, anyway. I was 16
when the biggest event in my house occurred.&nbsp;
I had the house to myself for the weekend, and had some of my
girlfriends over to keep me company.&nbsp; One
of my friends was sitting on the stairs, facing the opposite direction
talking
to her mother on the phone.&nbsp; I was
upstairs in my bedroom and 2 other friends were in the den watching
television.&nbsp; The friend sitting on the
stairs let out a shriek and I heard her run into the den.&nbsp; When I
asked her what happened, she told me
"something kicked her in the butt."&nbsp;
As I said before, it was just the 4 of us, and anyone else walking up
or
down the stairs would have definitely been noticed by either her or
myself.&nbsp; Needless to say, those friends
weren't too keen on coming back over after that.The final parts to my
experiences have taken place at my neighbor's house.&nbsp; Their house
is situated up the hill to the
south of my mom's house.&nbsp; Their house overlooks
ours, slightly.&nbsp; They got custody of
their grandchildren when I was about 19, but I had been babysitting for
her
oldest granddaughter since I was 14.&nbsp; The
first time I remember Granddaughter telling me she "saw things", I
was 18.&nbsp; She would tell me she saw
"The Cowboy" and that she would hear "kids running
around".&nbsp; I believed her, but since
I hadn't ever seen anything at that house, I didn't ask too many
questions.&nbsp; One night, in 2007, I was staying overnight,
watching all of the grandkids.&nbsp; The younger
2 were trying to stay up later than their bedtime and had been jumping
on beds,
and generally being noisy.&nbsp; At around 10,
I headed up stairs to threaten them to within an inch of their lives if
they
stayed up another minute.&nbsp; I put them to
bed and that was that....or so I though.&nbsp;
Not 15 minutes later, I hear a thud and then the sound of running down
the hall, then a door slam.&nbsp; I raced
upstairs and noticed that all of the doors were open.&nbsp; When I got
into the Granddaughter #2's
bedroom, I noticed she was sound asleep, dead to the world.&nbsp; She
didn't wake even when I shook her.&nbsp; I looked at Granddaughter #1
and her eyes
were as big as dinner plates.&nbsp; We went
back down stairs, where I told #1 that it was her bedtime.&nbsp; She
asked me if she could sleep on the couch
with me, because she was scared to sleep in her room alone.&nbsp; I
told her that was fine, but she had to
sleep.&nbsp; She headed into the rest room to
wash up and while she was in there, I heard what sounded like someone
coming
down the stairs.&nbsp; I waited, thinking one
of the younger kids needed water.&nbsp; The
last 2 (or first two, if you're going upstairs) steps creak something
wicked
when you push on the step and it's next to impossible to miss them
without
jumping and landing on the tile with a thud.&nbsp;
There was the quick step-creak-step-creak of the last 2 steps
and....nothing.&nbsp; No little kid with bare
feet, no one.&nbsp; I got up and as I was
about to cross into the hallway, there were several long, extremely
loud peals
of laughter, almost like a baby being tickled, while laughing into a
microphone.&nbsp; #1, wide eyed, peeked around
the doorjam, visibly shaking.&nbsp; She looked
at me and asked me if I had heard it.&nbsp; Of
course, I had.&nbsp; I told her it wasn't
anything to worry about and she needed to get to sleep.&nbsp; Yeah, let
me tell you, no one slept after
that.&nbsp; I told my mom's neighbor what had
happened and she said it wasn't unusual.&nbsp;
Strange stuff had been happening since they had started remodelling,
the
year before.....I found out several years ago that the 3 houses on my
mom's
"block" sit on decomposed granite....and limestone and quartz.&nbsp;
Luckily, my baby sister doesn't have any
experiences.&nbsp; One final thing: my
great-grandmother died when I was 17.&nbsp;
She was 111 (we think; she lied about her age) and was wheelchair bound
before I was born.&nbsp; I remember her her
wearing a very cloying, floral scent, difficult to describe other than
it was
very sweet, dense and the scent lingered.&nbsp;
Right after she died, my younger cousin told me she would dream about
Nana, and sometimes she could still smell her perfume.&nbsp; It made
sense that my cousin would have this
experience because she was closest with our Nana.&nbsp; But apparently,
Nana watches over all of us.&nbsp; The first night I spent in my new
place, I
dreamed of her.&nbsp; She would often pat and
rub the hand she was holding....I woke up to something patting my
foot...and
the cloying scent of her perfume.&nbsp; Looks
like Nana still has plenty to do to keep her occupied!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Night Haunt</big></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>By:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
lbomber13@gmail.com</big></big></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>I
have had a multitude of sensory experiences with something beyond this
reality
throughout my entire life, but this was the first time I have ever
clearly seen
an actual person. I was home with my two daughters and two sisters, my
mother
was out of state, and I had felt watched all evening but had ignored it
and
focused on the kids. Later I was walking my infant daughter around my
bedroom,
trying to get her into a deep sleep before attempting to put her down
in the
crib, when I suddenly felt I was being watched. I turned toward the
hallway and
standing there was a little girl of about 8-11 in old clothing (perhaps
early
1900&#8217;s) watching us. She was only visible to me for 5 seconds max, but
she was
not transparent as I could not see the laundry basket that I know was
there behind
her and I got the feeling that she had not meant to be seen. Her face
was very
gruesome, she in fact looked dead, a true post-mortem manifestation.
Despite
her appearance I was not afraid of her because she had a very peaceful
look on
her face and I got the immediate feeling that she was soothed by my
daughter
and I. As I said she disappeared almost immediately upon sight but
there was an
air of sadness that remained as well as a kind of longing, which I
interpreted
as her missing her mother. I was not afraid to leave my daughter alone
but I
stood there cradling her for a few minutes more wanting to cherish the
moments
of infancy as the child had reminded me that children are taken from
this
reality every day. For the remainder of the night I felt followed and
watched
whether I was inside the house or outside. I knew she would not hurt us
but I
also knew this wasn&#8217;t where she belonged so I kept repeating in my head
&#8220;you
don&#8217;t belong here, you can&#8217;t stay&#8221; and the next morning she was gone. I
wonder
who she was and what happened to her all the time, even now, just
writing about
it creates a sadness in me because she just seemed so lost but there
was
nothing I could do for her. I don&#8217;t wish to see her again, but I hope
she can
find some peace.</big></big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big><big>We
lived on Robards Way in Hermitage, Tn. (Jackson&#8217;s Retreat Subdivision)
for 19
years and a woman who looked like Rachel Jackson would appear in my
bathroom
mirror when I was doing my hair or putting on my makeup. And daughter
said she
used to see a ghost figure in her room. You always new someone was in
the house
because you could always feel there presence and sometime it would wake
me as
it floated across my bed. These things would even spook my cats at
night. They
would look out the window and both of them would come running and
crying away
from the window and we would look out and nothing was there. But they
both were
scared to death.</big></big><span
