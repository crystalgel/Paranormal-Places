</H3><P><B>by moodycpa@msn.com </B>
<P>
<P><B>I love animals. I have had them most of my life. Birds, fish, cats,

reptiles </B>
<P><B>and rabbits.  Having so many animals, I am also used to their deaths.
But none </B>
<P><B>broke my heart more than Lily and Clover.  She was a white Netherland
Dwarf </B>
<P><B>with red eyes, and chocolet colored feet, nose, ears and tail.  I loved

Lily </B>
<P><B>very much, and she gave me another rabbit, her son Clover. He looked
just like </B>
<P><B>her except his markings were smoky blue. They had cages next to each
other and </B>
<P><B>were very close.</B>
<P><B>	After many years, Clover came down with a disease.  It is a disease
that </B>
<P><B>cannot be cured, but I treated him with antibiotics. He got a little

better.  </B>
<P><B>	After a few months, the disease hit him again, and it hit Lily too.
 The </B>
<P><B>disease can cause abcesses in the jaw of the rabbit, and there was
a huge one </B>
<P><B>in Lily's. The abcess was so big it, caused her eye to protrued so
much she </B>
<P><B>couldn't close her eyelid, and her eye dried up on the side of her
head. </B>
<P><B>Despite my attempts to help her I finaly opted to put her to sleep.
I have </B>
<P><B>never had to make that desicion before.  But even after I set the date
for the </B>
<P><B>next day, I got the feeling she didn't want to be put to sleep. She
was still </B>
<P><B>eating, and tried to be lively. I wanted to be with her when it happend
and I </B>
<P><B>watched as the vet gassed her up so she wouldn't feel anything.  But
when he </B>
<P><B>injected the needle into her heart, she convulsed and made a tiny squeal
of </B>
<P><B>pain. Oh God she felt it! </B>
<P><B>	With that haunting my mind, I went home, buried her body, and tried
to move </B>
<P><B>on with my life. But soon at night, I began hearing thumping noises,
like the </B>
<P><B>ones rabbits make when they are scared and warn the others. I would
also </B>
<P><B>sometimes wake up hearing that same squeal Lily had made that day.
I would </B>
<P><B>look at my cat that sleeps at the end of my bed, and his ears would
be perked </B>
<P><B>up. He heard something too.  For months I would hear these noises at
least </B>
<P><B>twice a week.</B>
<P><B>	I cared for Clover for those months but he wasn't getting any better.
 And </B>
<P><B>sometimes I would see the shape of two rabbits in his cage for instant
and </B>
<P><B>then see one.  Clovers cage was in the TV room and when the lights
are off it </B>
<P><B>gets very dark. But I could swear seeing the figure of a small rabbit

running </B>
<P><B>across the floor. But Clover was still in his cage. In fact he was
so weak he </B>
<P><B>couldn't even move much. 	Clover's illness got to the point where I
decide to </B>
<P><B>put him to sleep too. But he too didn't seem to want to be put to sleep

</B>
<P><B>either. He wanted to live despite the fact he couldn't move even to
groom </B>
<P><B>himself. I went to sleep that night thinking about it. I finally decided
to do </B>
<P><B>it.  </B>
<P><B>	That night I woke up to the thumping noises, louder than I ever heard

them. I </B>
<P><B>went downstairs, my cat was no where to be seen.  I went into the TV
room and </B>
<P><B>saw Lily. She was standing near Clovers cage, growling at me.(Rabbits
do </B>
<P><B>growl.) I could hear Clover moving in the cage and went towards him

thinking </B>
<P><B>about how scared he must be.  Lily's ghost then rushed forward and
bit me in </B>
<P><B>the ankle.  Scared out of my wits, I flew back upstairs and under the

covers </B>
<P><B>of my bed. For the rest of the night I heard the thumps and squeals,
but I </B>
<P><B>didn't dare look for the apparition. But I got the message loud and
clear. </B>
<P><B>DON'T put Clover to sleep!</B>
<P><B>	Finally, Clover died by himself. Now both he and Lily's ghosts are
running </B>
<P><B>around here. But I don't hear any more squeals or thumpings. I have
a small </B>
<P><B>scar on my leg where Lily bit me.  And I sometimes see two dark bunny

figures </B>
<P><B>hopping through the house together, and sometimes, I can still feel
two warm </B>
<P><B>tougues licking my hand when I am asleep.  </B>

<H3><A NAME=old>Ghosts in an Old House</A>
</H3><P><B>by MerComSv@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>My coworkers and I feel that at least half of the mansion that we work
out of is haunted.  It's a big old place that was built in 1869 in Philadelphia.

 We work in half of the house and the other half is used for storage.  Now
one guy who is a skeptic of all things occult distinctly heard children playing

on the other half of the house.  When he got up, it stopped.  There were
no kids around the outside and none inside.  He was alone.  Other people
have complained of a toaster oven that used to turn on when it was unplugged.
 The shutters used to open every morning on the other half after they had
been closed the night before.  I myself distinctly heard a man's husky cough
when I was alone in the house.  Just lastnight myself and another girl I
work with were getting ready to leave, about 10 PM and we heard what sounded
like running and a cat's scream, stuff being knoecked over, etc.  The sound
was coming right towards us from the other half.  We were standing in the
doorway to the outside, jumped out and slammed the door shut.  Then we heard

nothing.  Not a single sound, you could've heard a pin drop.  It scared us
to death.  When we went back inside we saw nothing out of the ordinary, except
a light on up on the third floor in that other half of the house.  The problem
is that there is no electricity over there.  What do you think and what should
we do?</B>
<P><B>     We've tried to get info on the house, but we don't know much about
the guy who built it other than that his name is George Thomas and this house
was built for his second wife.  He had a cottage on the same property with
his first wife who died.  We'd appreciate any help!</B>

<H3><A NAME=2>2 Visions</A>
</H3><P><B>by KBTNELSON@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>These two stories were told to me by my mother back in 1985, after
the death of my grandmother.  When I was a child, my grandmother mentioned
to me that  she liked the song "The Impossible Dream" from Man of La  Mancha,
and wanted it played at her funeral.  When I asked her what would happen
if the song wasn't played, she said that she would come back and haunt me.
 At the end of July 1985, my grandmother died.  The first thing I told my
mother while still in the hospital was that "Grandma wants "The Impossible
Dream" played at her funeral."  I am glad I remembered that because a few
months later, my mother told me this story:  On the day after my grandmothers

death, my mother, and her 2 brothers were making funeral arrangements.  My

Mothers twin brother Bill was going "nuts" looking for the "grandmothers
ring" (it had her birthstone in the center, surrounded by the birthstones
of her 4 grandchildren). Bill was desparate to find this ring, and would
not rest until it was found.  He told my mother later (after the ring was
found), that that morning before he left to meet my mother and their other

brother John,  Bill had been on the telephone with his girlfriend, the line
had a "bad connection" and suddenly the line broke up and Bill heared my

grandmother say, "I want my ring!", after that the phone line was fine, and
Bill continued his conversation with his girlfriend (who had not heared what
my grandmother had said).  The thing is the ring was taken off at the funeral

home in order for it to be returned to the family, so that hte family could

decide what to do with it.  Nobody knew that the ring had been removed from

grandma's finger until after my uncle had started his search, nobody that
is, except for grandma.</B>
<P><B>     That same day my mother shared at story with me about my great-great

grnadmother.  My great-great grandmother Robertson was a Cherokee Indian
(married to a white man).  My grandma Robertson was once seriously ill, and
it was thought that she may not live.  One night my grandmother's illness
reached a crisis situation, but she lived.  A few days later when she felt

better, grandma went out side </B>
<P><B>and found red feathers in the yard.  It then that she revield that
on the night if her crisis, an Indian wearing red featehers came to her and
told that she would live.</B>

<P>
<P><B>having seen your page i feel prompted to answer with an experience
that </B>
<P><B>happened to me several years ago in Birmingham England.</B>
<P><B>I am the greatist sceptic in the universe but events that day made
me </B>
<P><B>rethink.</B>
<P><B>It was a very warm day  I had the contract to paint and decorate what
the </B>

<P><B>upstairs at that,so the building was not in a real state of disrepair

over.</B>
<P><B>I went down stairs and the old lady who owned the shop said "are you

<H3><A NAME=cup>The Cup in the Bathtub</A>
</H3><P><B>by jclayton@shaysnet.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>I spent my teenage years in a house in Winchester, Massachusetts, a

suburb</B>
<P><B>of Boston. Two or three times during that period, probably about

midnight,</B>
<P><B>after my parents and younger sisters were long asleep, I heard the

plastic</B>
<P><B>drinking cup from the bathroom sink fall into the adjacent bathtub

and</B>
<P><B>bounce around before coming to a stop. Upon investigating, the cup

was</B>
<P><B>where it was supposed to be, by the sink. I never mentioned this to

anyone</B>
<P><B>for fear of ridicule. About ten years later, my youngest sister and
I were</B>
<P><B>talking about ghosts and, unprompted, she told me that she used to
hear the</B>
<P><B>sound of the plastic cup falling into the bathtub late at night...
Of</B>
<P><B>course, when she investigated, all was as it should be...</B>
<P>
<P><B>There were other oddities as well. Once, when running up the stairs

from</B>
<P><B>the first to second floors, I saw what appeared to be a</B>
<P><B>translucent foot, but it disappeared in a heartbeat and I never saw</B>
<P><B>it again. The time 1:18 PM seems to have been connected to the</B>
<P><B>phenomena... One day my pocket watch stopped at 1:18. Sure,</B>
<P><B>BFD. The next day, it did it again. Well, coincidence... A few days</B>
<P><B>later, it did it again, 1:18... and the clock by my desk _also_ had

stopped</B>
<P><B>at 1:18. I soon replaced that old wind-up clock with an electric

alarm</B>
<P><B>clock. A month or so later, my pocket watch stopped at 1:18 again.

Quickly,</B>
<P><B>I looked at the electric clock, then caught myself and

laughed--electric</B>
<P><B>clocks don't just stop! Sure enough, it was still going. I stopped</B>
<P><B>laughing, though... it was running backwards, the second hand going</B>
<P><B>_counterclockwise_...</B>

<H3><A NAME=granny>Granny</A>
</H3><P><B>by &nbsp;donnaherrick@juno.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>I have experienced many things in my life that most people would

describe</B>
<P><B>as some sort of encounter with ghosts/spirits/the supernatural. We've</B>
<P><B>lived in haunted houses, some with pleasant spirits that made the

place</B>
<P><B>very comfortable and peaceful, some with very evil presences which</B>
<P><B>effected our entire family and were quite frightening. However, I've</B>
<P><B>always treid to explain these incidents away..to try and force the</B>
<P><B>supernatural peg into a perfectly natural hole. My whole family, for</B>
<P><B>generations back, has had a belief in and a connection with the</B>
<P><B>paranormal. I have tried to deny that such things ever hapen to me,</B>
<P><B>because in short, I was afraid. I didn't want to acknowledge anything

for</B>
<P><B>fear that these things would keep happening to me. I didn't want them

to.</B>
<P><B>However, two instances occurred that forced me to believe in these

things</B>
<P><B>and, though it didn't allay my fears entirely, it did alleviate some

of</B>
<P><B>the sheer terror.</B>
<P>
<P><B>In July of 1994, my grandmother died suddenly. I was extremely close

to</B>
<P><B>her and her death hit me very hard. It was especially difficult for

me</B>
<P><B>as, the day before her death, I was to have gone to lunch with her

but,</B>
<P><B>not wanting to drive across town in the 114 degree heat, I'd cancelled.

I</B>
<P><B>had these horrible feelings of guilt and those, coupled with the</B>
<P><B>tremendous sense of loss, made me feel as if I was buckling under

this</B>
<P><B>enormous weight. For months I walked around in constant pain and

anguish.</B>
<P><B>I felt terrible that I'd never been able to tell her goodbye and I</B>
<P><B>wondered if she knew how much I loved her. I tried very hard not to

cry</B>
<P><B>or be sad, to think that she'd surely gone to some better place. My</B>
<P><B>family holds the old Scottish/Irish belief that to keep crying for
or</B>
<P><B>calling to a deceased loved one keeps their spirit here and won't let</B>
<P><B>them go to a better place. So, one night I called out to my Granny

and</B>
<P><B>told her to please try to come to me and tell me goodbye. I promised</B>
<P><B>that, if she did, I'd stop crying and let her go on. </B>
<P>
<P><B>I went to bed that same evening with the hope that my Granny would

appear</B>
<P><B>to me or send me some sort of "signal". I was also very afraid that

I'd</B>
<P><B>called sometihng else to come out. I had a strong fear of

"pretenders"</B>
<P><B>since I was six and my aunt Vernita passed away. The day after she
died I</B>
<P><B>was asleep in my mom's bed and woke up to hear the doorknob rattling

back</B>
<P><B>and forth. The door opened and two figures walked in. Both looked</B>
<P><B>very..dried out, almost decayed and the approached the bed and tried

to</B>
<P><B>talk to me. I refused to talk with them, but I couldn't move to get

away</B>
<P><B>from them. The one in front was bad, I knew it, so I looked at the

second</B>
<P><B>figure and she said, "Don't be afraid, sweetie, I'm your Aunt Venita".

I</B>
<P><B>told her, "You aren't my aunt, you don't even know how to say her

name."</B>
<P><B>At which point the two figures shrieked, "She's in hell! She's in

hell!"</B>
<P><B>and faded away. So, I was afraid that, in calling my Granny, I'd call</B>
<P><B>some pretender. </B>
<P>
<P><B>That night I awakened to see my Granny across the room, in the

doorway.</B>
<P><B>She was wearing her pink nightgown and sort of glided toward me as
I sat</B>
<P><B>up woth my arms out. I was crying and talking to her and telling her

I</B>
<P><B>loved her and missed her andwhen she got near my bed, the smell hit

me..a</B>
<P><B>cold, dirty smell. As she neared the bed, her arms came up as if to

grab</B>
<P><B>me and her mouth dropped open and the most awful, horrible moan came

out</B>
<P><B>of her. It was so ugly and evil and it really looked for all the world

as</B>
<P><B>if someone was holding up a dead body and it's jaw dropped open. I</B>
<P><B>screamed and woke my boyfriend, who saw nothing. I jumped under the</B>
<P><B>covers and eventually the vision faded, but the moaning continued

until</B>
<P><B>it dissolved into this really mirthful, tinkling laughter. After that,

I</B>
<P><B>tried to not think of my Granny. I didn't want to disturb her and

didn't</B>
<P><B>want the pretender to come back. I also tried very hard to pretend

that</B>
<P><B>the whole incident had been a dream.</B>
<P>
<P><B>In the fall of 1994, I was at my parent's home the night before</B>
<P><B>Thanksgiving. It was very difficult for me to think of the

approaching</B>
<P><B>holidays as I didn't want to celebrate without my Granny. That night,

my</B>
<P><B>mother reminded me to wake her at 3:00 AM to put the turkey in the

oven.</B>
<P><B>My mother is notorious for oversleeping. In fact, my Granny always

used</B>
<P><B>to wake her on the holidays so that our holiday dinner was cooked on</B>
<P><B>time. At any rate, everyone went to bed and I stayed on the ocuch</B>
<P><B>watching television. At about 1:30, I saw a commercial that said the

film</B>
<P><B>"Tower of London" was coming on. Since I enjoy that film and it was</B>
<P><B>nearly time to wake my mom, I decided to just stay up until the film

was</B>
<P><B>over and the turkey safely in the oven. I remember looking at the

clock</B>
<P><B>at about 2:15 and then returned my attention to the film. I dozed off

and</B>
<P><B>woke at 2:45. I recall looking at the clock, I recall hearing the

movie.</B>
<P><B>I felt myself beginning to fall asleep again and tried to make myself</B>
<P><B>stay awake for a few more moments, just to wake my mom. I felt scared

all</B>
<P><B>of the sudden and wished I'd left a light on. At that point, the hal</B>
<P><B>light came on and I thought that, miracle of miracles, my mother had</B>
<P><B>managed to wake up on time. I watched the hall and saw a shadow

advancing</B>
<P><B>down the hall very slowly. I was spellbound, just watching how very</B>
<P><B>slowly it moved, how long it was taking for someone to walk the 15

foot</B>
<P><B>length of the hallway. I could still hear the movie, but the voices

were</B>
<P><B>droning, like a 45 record on 33. I felt afraid and shut my eyes,

which</B>
<P><B>was quite an effort. The next thing I recall was a hand on my shoulder.

I</B>
<P><B>opened my eyes and first looked at the clock, which read 3:15. I

looked</B>
<P><B>up and there, with her very real hand onmy shoulder, was my Granny.

She</B>
<P><B>was wearing her favorite red and white dress and said, very clearly,

"You</B>
<P><B>have to wake Mommy up, it's time to put the turkey in." I sat up and</B>
<P><B>jumped to my knees and leaned over the back of the couch to try and

give</B>
<P><B>her a hug. I ws thinking how happy I was, how much I loved her and

she</B>
<P><B>smiled and sort of nodded, like she knew just what I was thinking.

But</B>
<P><B>she wouldn't let me touch her. When I trie dto , she backed away. At

that</B>
<P><B>moment, our cat jumped on the sofa and looked right up at my Granny.

I</B>
<P><B>looked at the cat for just a second, but when I turned my head back,

she</B>
<P><B>was gone. </B>
<P>
<P><B>I know I was awake. I heard the movie, saw and heard the cat and was</B>
<P><B>fully aware of what was going on around me. I know in my heart that

it</B>
<P><B>was not a dream. When I woke my mom, she was dismayed that she hadn't</B>
<P><B>herd her alarm (again) and asked how I'd managed to wake her up in

time.</B>
<P><B>All I said was, "Granny woke me up." </B>
<P>
<P><B>I know it is wrong to want my Granny to still be here with me and I

know</B>
<P><B>if I thougt htat she wa around all of the time, it might frighten me,</B>
<P><B>but, since that Thanksgiving encounter, I no longer discount the

things</B>
<P><B>that happened and continue to happen to me and I am learning the</B>
<P><B>difference in feeling between the spirit of someone who loved/loves

you</B>
<P><B>and the spirit of someone or something who is out to trick you or

hurt</B>
<P><B>you. </B>

<H3><A NAME=movie>Movie Theatre</A>
</H3><P><B>by luscombe@vci.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>My name is Jason, I work at the only movie theatre in operation in</B>
<P><B>Paducah, KY. A few I started working there Al came to me and told me

he</B>
<P><B>thought he had seen a ghost in theatre #12. (Al is normally under the</B>
<P><B>influence of something, so I really didn't believe him.) He told me
that he</B>
<P><B>saw a grown man sitting in the 3rd or 4th row, on the left aisle, in

the</B>
<P><B>seat against the wall. He said he saw him when all of the lights were

off;</B>
<P><B>even the aisle lights were off the only light that was on was the exit

sign</B>
<P><B>light above the door on the other side of the theatre. It was basicly</B>
<P><B>pitch-black in there, He also added that it did not look like any

special</B>
<P><B>F-X ghost he had seen on TV, he said it didn't glow or anything like

that</B>
<P><B>but it was visible in the pitch-dark. </B>
<P><B>	During that same week, one of the managers told me what had happened

to</B>
<P><B>them the other night. She was down stairs talking to a consessionist

after</B>
<P><B>the theatre had closed,so those two and the projectionist,(Mike), were

the</B>
<P><B>only one in the theatre  besides the janitors. Well anyway, the two

down</B>
<P><B>stairs were talking and mike came down stairs and asked if anyone had

been</B>
<P><B>upstairs. The manager said no, and then asked why. Mike told her what

had</B>
<P><B>happened. He was up there shutting down the projectors when he went

around</B>
<P><B>the corner to shut off #12 he saw someone standing in the doorway to

the</B>
<P><B>stairwell that leads to  theatre #12's Exit door. the man staired at

him</B>
<P><B>just for a split second then vanished. The manager assured him that
no one</B>
<P><B>had been up there, because all of the janitors had been cleaning in

the</B>
<P><B>lobby (that where she was sitting and talking). </B>
<P><B>	Later more people were getting freaked-out by all that stuff. So one

of</B>
<P><B>the other ushers asked his older brother that use to work at the

theatre</B>
<P><B>about 6-7 years ago. He found out some scary info. Theatre numbers

11&amp;12</B>
<P><B>were added on to the building much later after the rest of the theatre

was</B>
<P><B>built. (numbers 11&amp;12 are built differently than the others they
are also</B>

construction</B>
<P><B>workers died of a heart attack while working on it.</B>
<P><B>	 One man has heard his name yelled from directly behind him and turn</B>
<P><B>around and no one would be there while he was upstairs by #12. And

many</B>
<P><B>have said they have heard footsteps around the stairwell and around

the</B>
<P><B>projector of #12. And many other employees say they have seen him

sitting</B>
<P><B>in the seat against the wall in the 3rd or 4th row on the left hand

side</B>
<P><B>and always while all the lights are off. </B>
<P><B>	Personally I have never seen him but I do usually get chills and/or

goose</B>
<P><B>bumps when I walk into that theatre, I also noticed that the projector

for</B>

<H3><A NAME=3b>Apartment 3B</A>
</H3><P><B>by TGiovannon@aol.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>I usually dont tell anyone of what has happened to me and my family,
I stumbled across this page doing research for a show on the paranormal and
well I felt compeled to share this with all of you....I dont know how or
why this happened to us, all I know is once a happy flourishing family has
been utterly destroyed and the home we once lived in is in complete disarray,

many things have happened there and though it is still being financially
kept everyone refuses to be there never mind spend the night.....When we
first moved into the apartment my children were all small , I have four,
two girls two boys...the girls are older . We were a young couple and you
could say we were all growing up together, both of us raised in the catholic

religion, though we were not practicing Catholics, we did believe in the
catholic traditions yet we hardly ever went to church. we moved in the apt

shortly after my fourth child was born and everything seemed wonderful, for
years we lived peacefully and nothing was happening..I must say that I as
well as my Ex husband did experience paranormal activity when we were children

and growing up....premonitionary dreams, ESP, ect...but nothing concerning

hauntings untill that apt....as in anything having to do with the paranormal

society considers it as hokey and usually just stories that are made up for
one reason or another, I assure you this was not the usual "fun" stuff people

entertain themselves with...it actually destroyed us and the reality we called

our lives....sometime around the mid 8o's things began to happen...physical

things as well as dreams and disturbances....the very first occurance that
I recall was one afternoon while my three children were in school I was cleaning

the apt while the baby was asleep in his crib, I heard our dog howling in
a peculiar way in the babies room and rushed in to see the dog standing on
his hind legs looking up at the ceiling and howling...this totally freaked
me out and I quickly called out his name to no avail...the dog continued
to howl and after about a minute he stopped and walked out of the room like
if nothing had happened...it was very light in the room I did not see or
hear anything...I just told my husband when he got home from work and we
chalked it up to just something the dog mustve heard outside....shortly after

that within days , one evening I decided to clean out the hallway closet...it
had been cluttered with christmas stuff and old toys...I began to take things
off the top shelf of the closet and came across a ball my Grandfather had
given me as a child...as I held the ball in my hands I felt a sensation of
heat and slight vibrations...I quickly dropped it on the floor and didnt
handle it untill I had no choice but to....that night around 3 in the morning
I awakened from a bad dream as did my husband, we were both having nightmares
at the same time and awoke at the same time...what we witnessed infront of
us was a remarkable sight....it seemed like a ball or a fist shaped object
to the consistency of what I can only describe as Jello , light blue in color

just floating in mid air...it was translucent and it floated up to the ceiling

untill it dissapeared...I felt total peace as I watched this thing and I
was not frightned at all, I was thrilled that i had witnessed something not
of this world and happy that it was something good because of the way it
made me feel...I was already starting to believe we had a visitor and it
was friendly, I welcomed it and I felt privaledged to say the least...but
things did not remain the same, it seemed that around this period of time
things were happening within days of the other so three days later as I was
in my bedroom with my children and my husband I was leaning against our dresser

and talking, there was a dish on the dresser next to me, my arms were crossed
and I was in conversation with my husband when all of a sudden the plate
flew against the wall behind me and shattered, we all looked at each other
and my husband asked me why I had done that...I told him I didnt that my
arms were crossed as they still were....I knew I was in trouble then....nights

passed with something happening almost every night...one night I awoke again
at 3 in the morning to hear foot steps in the hallway, the next night I awakened

to hear my sons musical cho cho playing and I thought he was awake...I went
into the room to find him fast asleep and in the same position I had left
him hours ago...and the choo choo was still in the same position as well,
and it had stopped playing when I walked into the room....another time I
was awakened by the phone ringing at 6 in the morning....I had to get up
and walk to the kitchen where the phone was, when I answered it all I could
hear was static...I hung up and went back to bed...15 min. later it rang
again, I got up walked to the kitchen and ans. it...again static...I hung
up and stood there in shock for what I was hearing in my kitchen were actual

moans...I was frozen, couldnt move..I managed to get back tobed and stared
up at my ceiling untill everyone else woke up...I did not tell anyone of
this untill years later, but I did call a place that was refered to me by
the NY public library as the society for pychical research, and I spoke to
a Dr. Osis who helped me with thse disturbances at the time...unfortunately
it did not get any better..it worsened to what I now describe as pure evil,
my daughter began to see an old gentelman dressed in a brown siut pass bacvk
and fourth between the babies room and the bathroom, she would tell me and
there really wasnt much I could do but to be in complete denial and not pay

attention to anything else that was going on...it started affecting us physically

and mentally...I was one of its first victim and the first to leave the

household....I began to sense something that was telling me to kill myself...over

and over I would sense this on a daily basis...I thought I was going insane,
I went through therapy, medication, I locked myself in my room because I
thought I was dangerous, I went down to 95 pounds and was classified as having
a nervous breakdown....after a year of this i began to recouperate but things

were definately bad in the apt...everyone who would come to visit could sense

darkness and eventually our friends just dwindled away....my son for no reason
at all and no family history began having convulsions, after examinations
and test there was never any explanations of why this happened to him....I
left the household in 1990, my children would go and visit their father and
would spend the night...once my son and my daughter were watching tv in the

evening...the door was locked and the chain was on...they began to hear the
lock of the door being played with and they both looked over to the door,
they saw the chain on the door physically lifted off and fall and the door
fly forcably against the wall...needless to say they ran out of the apt...there

has been too many things that have happened for me to mention it all...but
my Ex husband did suffer a break down this is how it was explained

clinically...actually he began to hear voices telling him to kill himself
and that they were going to get us all, my daughter once while sleeping over
was held down to her bed while she heard a voice taunting her that he had
her now...everything that goes to that apt seems to break and theres an

infestation of roaches even though the apt has been fumigated countless of

times....as I said before...it stands alone now...no one goes there no one
sleeps there..its just there...whoever wanted it for themselves, achieved
it to its greatest power....I tell you this because maybe there are other

families who have been or are going through this now...maybe the end result
will not be like ours, maybe someone will be able to help these victims from

whatever it is that is out there.</B>

</H3><P><B>by iciafro@concentric.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>I have been tormented, scared out of my mind, and had jokes </B>
<P><B>played on me for years on end by what I and friends/family</B>
<P><B>believe to be some kind of entity or spirit.  I don't wish </B>
<P><B>to become anyones school paper or test subject, I would </B>
<P><B>just like some advice to mabey deal with the problem.</B>
<P><B>It all started when I was nine years old an my father sent </B>
<P><B>me to bed.  I was never really scared of the dark so my </B>
<P><B>father would allow me to tuck myself in an that night was </B>
<P><B>going to be diffrent.  My room was on the top floor of a </B>
<P><B>three story house an I never made it to the third story.</B>
<P><B>I thought I saw something move in the darkness of the third </B>
<P><B>floor an then I heard verey clearly someone say my name.</B>
<P><B>By the secound time this happened that night my father had </B>
<P><B>to carry me kicking and screaming to bed, this started </B>
<P><B>happening at least twice a week.  I became very afraid of </B>
<P><B>the dark an one time when my father made me walk down a </B>
<P><B>dark hall way something brushed agenst me.  It scared me so </B>
<P><B>bad Dad found me curled into a ball on the floor.</B>
<P><B>Then things started happening around the house like vases </B>
<P><B>being broken, or stains on the floor that no one ever saw </B>
<P><B>happen so naturaly they were blamed on me.  I spent most of </B>
<P><B>my childhood in trouble for things I never did, an the more </B>
<P><B>trouble I was in the more things would happen to get me </B>
<P><B>into more trouble.  I was convenced that the house was </B>
<P><B>haunted an whatever was haunting the house didn't like me </B>
<P><B>at all.  </B>
<P><B>Finaly I convenced my Father to allow me to move in with my </B>
<P><B>Mother in the next town.  For two weeks nothing happened an </B>
<P><B>I thought I had escaped, but one night my cousen spent the </B>
<P><B>night an it all started again.  We were watching television </B>
<P><B>an suddenly it just turned off.  I got up to turn it back </B>
<P><B>on an when I did as soon as I sat down it turned back off.  </B>
<P><B>This went on several times an then my cousen tried to turn </B>
<P><B>it on an when he got up something pushed him back into his </B>
<P><B>chair.  He didn't even have time to scream before the </B>
<P><B>television started turning itself on an off rapidly an then </B>
<P><B>the power to the whole house went off leaving us in the </B>
<P><B>dark.  My mother took him home an he never spent the night </B>
<P><B>again.  </B>
<P><B>I am twenty years old now an if I wrote everything that has </B>
<P><B>happened I'd be here for two days.  I can tell you that </B>
<P><B>this has so far ruined my life.  I even failed college </B>
<P><B>beceause It wouldn't let me sleep at night an it wouled </B>
<P><B>drive all of my roomates away.  My first week there I had </B>
<P><B>to get eight copies of my schedule, even if I wrote it down </B>
<P><B>in my note book the paper would be missing th next day.</B>
<P><B> I just wan't to be normal an live a normal life please </B>
<P><B>help if you can.  I have not read what has happened to you </B>
<P><B>yet but I will before I leave this site.  I hope this is </B>

<H3><A NAME=took>She Took My Breath Away</A>
</H3><P><B>by soy@intranet.ca</B>
<P>
<P><B>Let me assure you, this is true, this is completely true.  I wish it

wasn't.</B>
<P><B>My Grandparents owned a older home, it's approximately 200 years old

now.</B>
<P><B>This home had a small apartment within it.  My parents had lived in

the</B>
<P><B>apartment when they were first married.  At 16 years old my

Grandparents</B>
<P><B>allowed me to live there... alone.</B>
<P><B>There was always a uncomfortable feeling about the little apartment,

like</B>
<P><B>someone watching you.  It was eerie, and everyone who had been there

had</B>
<P><B>sensed it.  No one liked to be left alone there, myself included. 
I would</B>
<P><B>frequently invite my friends to spend the night, just so I wasn't

always</B>
<P><B>alone there.  My best friend Barb was spending the night with me one

cold</B>
<P><B>winter evening.  So cold in fact I had dragged my mattress out to the

living</B>
<P><B>as the living room was the warmest room in the apartment.  My friend

Barb</B>
<P><B>was sleeping on the couch, I drifted off moments later.</B>
<P><B>I was sound asleep, flat on my back.  I felt it before I saw it.

 Before</B>
<P><B>opening my eyes I was aware that someone was laying on top of me, and

quite</B>
<P><B>heavy at that.  For a split second, the moment before opening my eyes

I</B>
<P><B>thought "Has Barb lost her marbles" Then after a few blinks I saw it.

 A</B>
<P><B>woman, completely white from head to toe, I could see her white hair</B>
<P><B>floating about her.  She was somehow, ghastly.  I can't explain it

really,</B>
<P><B>she just was.  I was overwhelmed with fear, I had to, needed to, wanted

to</B>
<P><B>scream!  I opened my mouth to draw in breath.  I felt my lungs empty,
like I</B>
<P><B>had fallen on my back and the wind was forced out.  I could not

scream</B>
<P><B>because she had sucked the life breath from me.</B>
<P><B>Then the weight began to lift, first from my chest then mid section.

 I</B>
<P><B>began to gasp for air, starring wide eyed at her face.  Finally she</B>
<P><B>completely raised herself off of me, and then.... she smiled.  I will

never</B>
<P><B>get the picture out of my mind, the most horrid smile, a look of</B>
<P><B>satisfaction.  She was gone.  As soon as fear had subsided enough for

my</B>
<P><B>breath and my speech to return, I did scream!  Barb awoke from her
place on</B>
<P><B>the sofa.  "What's wrong" she said.  I told her my story, crying as
I spoke.</B>
<P><B>Barb told me I was dreaming, and to forget about it.  Well, I tried.</B>
<P><B>10 years later at 26, it still bothered me.  I still can't sleep on
my back.</B>
<P><B>On night a few months back I was visiting my Mother.  After a few glasses

of</B>
<P><B>wine, I began my story.  The story of how I once thought I saw a ghost.

You</B>
<P><B>may recall at the beginning of the story I mentioned my parents had

been</B>
<P><B>tenants in the same apartment before me.  I had got to the part in
my story</B>
<P><B>where I first felt it laying on me.  Then my Mother piped up

nonchalantly</B>
<P><B>and said "Oh, she's the one that takes your breath away" My heart sank

or</B>
<P><B>maybe it was in my throat, I don't recall which but I do know I was

pale.</B>
<P><B>This moment when I knew for sure that it really happened to me.  You

may</B>
<P><B>recall at the beginning of my story, my Mother and Father had lived
in the</B>
<P><B>same apartment when they first married.  As it turns out my Mother
had the</B>
<P><B>same experience 3 times while living there.  Well, like I said.....
I don't</B>
<P><B>sleep on my back anymore.</B>

<H3><A NAME=train>Ghost Train</A>
</H3><P><B>by tsteward@csrlink.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>I live in Williamsport, PA, about an hour and a half north of</B>
<P><B>Harrisburg.  This story happened to Nancy, a co-worker of mine.  She

was</B>
<P><B>seeing a guy named Dave who had heard stories about an old abandoned</B>
<P><B>house north of the city where strange things were said to have</B>
<P><B>occurred.  It was set back at the end of a dirt road, quite a

distance</B>
<P><B>from the highway, next to an old railway track.  This old brick house</B>
<P><B>was supposed to have been used as a temporary hospital for Civil War</B>
<P><B>soldiers.  I don't know whether these soldiers were Confederate</B>
<P><B>prisoners or wounded Union soldiers on their way north.  Word of

mouth</B>
<P><B>had it that a group of people went inside to look around.  When

someone</B>
<P><B>commented on the view from the bathroom, his companion led him back

to</B>
<P><B>the room and showed him the same window which was, in fact, bricked</B>
<P><B>over.</B>
<P><B>	Dave convinced Nancy that they should check it out.  They drove out

the</B>
<P><B>road, over the railroad tracks and parked in front of the old house.

 It</B>
<P><B>looked so forbidding that Nancy, who was driving, decided she didn't</B>
<P><B>want to go inside, so she turned around to head back.  </B>
<P><B>	They didn't get far, because the car stalled on the railroad tracks.

</B>
<P><B>Surprised and half jokingly, Dave asked Nancy what she was doing. </B>
<P><B>"Nothing," she said, as she frantically tried to re-start the engine.</B>
<P><B>"I'm not doing anything!"  Nancy turned the key over and over, but

the</B>
<P><B>engine wouldn't catch.  Suddenly, they were surrounded by a fog so

deep</B>
<P><B>they couldn't see in front or in back of them.  Nancy panicked and</B>
<P><B>scrambled for the door handle, but Dave restrained her, saying,

"You're</B>
<P><B>not going anywhere!"  Then they heard the train whistle.  Nancy and

Dave</B>
<P><B>looked to the right and saw the glare of the single headlight coming</B>
<P><B>directly toward them.  Nancy put her head forward, closed her eyes,

and</B>
<P><B>gripped the steering wheel as tight as she could.  She screamed and</B>
<P><B>braced herself for the collision.  But all she felt was a

whoosh...like</B>
<P><B>something going right through her.  She described it as an energy

force</B>
<P><B>passing right through her body.  </B>
<P><B>	Immediately afterward, the fog blew away as if by magic.  Nancy

grabbed</B>
<P><B>the key in the ignition, turned it, and the engine started up with
no</B>
<P><B>problem.  Nancy jammed her foot down on the accelerator, and the

tires</B>
<P><B>squealed as she drove away as fast as she could.</B>

<H3><A NAME=strange>A Strange Feeling about My House</A>
</H3><P><B>by kkaczur@ameritech.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>I have a feeling that something is going on in my house. I don't know

if</B>
<P><B>you would say it is haunted, but some unusual things happen here. My</B>
<P><B>mother tells me it is coincidences, but I don't think so. You be the</B>
<P><B>judge.</B>
<P>
<P><B>My parents bought the house I live in in 1987. They moved in 2 days</B>
<P><B>before Christmas, that in itself was a mess, but we had a family</B>
<P><B>Christmas there anyway.</B>
<P>
<P><B>The following July my mother was transfered to Washington D.C. Since

I</B>
<P><B>was the only unmarried daughter, I was told I needed to move into the</B>
<P><B>house, help pay the bills, and take care of my father. With that my

then</B>
<P><B>boyfriend Bill who I had lived with for 4 years before my parents

bought</B>
<P><B>the house, moved in.</B>
<P>
<P><B>From the moment we moved in, something did not feel right. I would

see</B>
<P><B>"something" out of the corner of my eye, but when I looked towards

it,</B>
<P><B>nothing would be there. My dog Wrinkles, a Bassett Hound, would sit

in</B>
<P><B>the familyroom and all of a sudden look upstairs towards the bedrooms</B>
<P><B>and bark and growel, every hair on her back would be standing up. I</B>
<P><B>would go upstairs and again saw nothing.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I would hear noises at about 2:30am, a loud banging sound, like

someone</B>
<P><B>took a sledgehammer against the side of the house. This of course

would</B>
<P><B>wake both my dog and myself up. I would go into the kitchen, where

the</B>
<P><B>sound seemed to be coming from, and nothing was out of place. No one</B>
<P><B>else would hear this, except one time my sister Penny. She came to

visit</B>
<P><B>me and was in the familyroom watching T.V. At 2:30am she too heard

the</B>
<P><B>noise. It scared her so much she wanted to call the police. </B>
<P>
<P><B>Anyway, the uncomfortable feeling continued. I was home most of the

time</B>
<P><B>by myself, my father would leave for work between 4:30am - 5am and

come</B>
<P><B>home about 9:30pm - 10pm. Bill was self-employed and would stay at

his</B>
<P><B>parents a lot since his father worked for him, and he would pick up

and</B>
<P><B>drop off his workers who didn't drive.</B>
<P>
<P><B>One incident will haunt me forever. I was always the last person to</B>
<P><B>leave the house in the morning. One day when I came home, I was

standing</B>
<P><B>in the kitchen and out of the corner of my eye I seen something move.

I</B>
<P><B>looked into the familyroom and the T.V. was on with the mute

activated.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Needless to say I was scared. I grabbed a knife and ran out of the</B>
<P><B>house. I went to my neighbors house and called the police. They

checked</B>
<P><B>my entire house and found no one there. No one was at my house that

day,</B>
<P><B>an no, I did not leave the T.V. on, I did not watch T.V. before I

went</B>
<P><B>to work. </B>
<P>
<P><B>I spoke to some of my neighbors, but never told them any experiences

I</B>
<P><B>was having. I was told that the couple who lived there before us

ended</B>
<P><B>up divorcing. They told me that the man who lived always thought

someone</B>
<P><B>was trying to break in the house, so he put rodiron stormdoors in the</B>
<P><B>front and on the patio doors. He even went so far as to brick in the</B>
<P><B>windows in the basement. As far as I know, no one ever tried to break

in</B>
<P><B>the house, it seemed to be "all in his mind". In hine site, I wonder

if</B>
<P><B>he was experiencing the same "feelings of uneasiness" as I had.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I was transfered to Pittsburg in January 1992. We moved my father

into</B>
<P><B>an apartment, and rented out the house (that in itself is another

story</B>
<P><B>altoghter). Bill bought a house and lived between there and staying

with</B>
<P><B>friends. I was gone for 1 1/2 years and hated every minute of it, I</B>
<P><B>missed my family and friends. I did not have any uneasy feelings while

I</B>
<P><B>was there. </B>
<P>
<P><B>I was transfered back to Cleveland in March 1994. Since we had

evicted</B>
<P><B>our tennants we (my father, Bill and I), moved back into the house.

The</B>
<P><B>feelings and sightings came back again.</B>
<P>
<P><B>In January 1996, after living together for 11 years, Bill and I

married.</B>
<P><B>My mother was transfered back to Cleveland the day before my wedding.

</B>
<P>
<P><B>Bill and I decided to live in the house until we had a new house

built.</B>
<P><B>His parents were living in the house that he had purchased a few

years</B>
<P><B>earlier, and we did not want to rent an apartment.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Bill was killed in a car accident by a drunk driver on August 9, 1996.

I</B>
<P><B>buried him one day before our 7th month anniversary. The uneasy

feelings</B>
<P><B>and sightings that I had had seemed to be stronger after my husband</B>
<P><B>died. I don't know if the sounds I heard were part of my grieving or</B>
<P><B>actual sounds. </B>
<P>
<P><B>Our bedroom was above the kitchen. After he died, I would sit in the</B>
<P><B>kitchen and hear sounds like he was getting out of bed. I had the</B>
<P><B>feeling he was watching me, but I never seen him.</B>
<P>
<P><B>My mother had a few experiences after Bill died too. Keep in mind

that</B>
<P><B>she never seen or heard anything unusual in the house. The first</B>
<P><B>incident she had was when she was in the kitchen cooking. She had the</B>
<P><B>feeling Bill was standing next to her, and she even turned around to</B>
<P><B>talk to him, but of course he was not there.</B>
<P>
<P><B>Another incident she had was a few days after that. She was up alone</B>
<P><B>very late one night, in the familyroom watching T.V. and got up to
go</B>
<P><B>upstairs to bed. She turned off the lights and was immediately

afraid.</B>
<P><B>She said it felt like someone was there watching her. She said she

ran</B>
<P><B>for the stairway to turn on the lights and ran upstairs. She did not

see</B>
<P><B>anyone. She said that was the 1st and only time she has every been</B>
<P><B>afraid in the house. I told her maybe it was Bill, she said, "No it

was</B>
<P><B>not Bill. Bill would never scare me like that". </B>
<P>
<P><B>I started to date again. My family had a party at my house and I

invited</B>
<P><B>the man I have been seeing to the party. Jim and I had pictures taken</B>
<P><B>together and every picture he and I are together in has a white

smokey</B>
<P><B>clouded area over us. The other pictures of family members are clear.

</B>
<P><B>I showed these pictures to family and friends and jokingly said it

was</B>
<P><B>Bill, a lot of them thought maybe it was.</B>
<P>
<P>
<P><B>I asked the camera shop where I have my pictures developed what the</B>
<P><B>shadow was, they told me that it was in the picture and they could

not</B>
<P><B>remove it, they could, however touch the pictures up, but that would

be</B>
<P><B>very expensive.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>To close, somethng happended to all of the families who lived in this</B>
<P><B>house. The first couple divorced. My parents did not divorce, but my</B>
<P><B>mother was transfered out of state. Bill and I moved in and I was</B>
<P><B>transfered out of state. I was transfered back, Bill and I married,

then</B>
<P><B>he died. My mother transfered back and my father did not die, but

ended</B>
<P><B>up having a stroke and is now unable to work. He was forced to

retired</B>
<P><B>from a job he loved, after 35 years at the same company.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I don't think what has happened here is just coincidence. What do you</B>
<P><B>think?</B>

<H3><A NAME=cat>My Cat Returns...for One More Night</A>
</H3><P><B>by tim@995yesfm.com</B>
<P>
<P><B>Being 25 years old, I have been a follower of ghosts stories since
I</B>
<P><B>was able to walk.  There is something exhilerating about the intense</B>
<P><B>feeling of fear that comes along with a ghost storie....TRUE GHOST</B>
<P><B>STORIES.  In my earliers, my friends and I did everything we could
to</B>
<P><B>find a ghost.  It ranged from taking tape recorders into a forbidden</B>
<P><B>Indian cemetary, to using Ouja boards on top of tomb stones.  We did</B>
<P><B>everything we could to experience an "EXPERIENCE" that we could</B>
<P><B>officialy say....."we saw a ghost"!!!  Although many strange events
took</B>
<P><B>place, nothing ever concrete made shape in front of us that we could</B>
<P><B>fullfil our dreams.  Eventualy we all grew up and went our own ways
to</B>
<P><B>college, and our Ghost Hunting days came to an end.  And it was in
then</B>
<P><B>that my first ever "true experience" happened.	It was over Christmas</B>
<P><B>Break in the winter of 1996, my last year of college at Central
Michigan</B>
<P><B>University.  I was back home with my family, and pets.  Pets have
always</B>
<P><B>been a huge part of my brothers and I growing up.  One night I woke
up</B>
<P><B>to this horrible banging sound, only to find our cat, who was 13
years</B>
<P><B>old and is quite old for a cat, was falling into convulsions.  She
shook</B>
<P><B>for an hour when she finaly fell asleep in my arms.  You see, her
normal</B>
<P><B>sleeping spot was on my bed when I came home.  The next night it</B>
<P><B>happened again, so we contacted the vet.  He informed us that at her
age</B>
<P><B>it was a simple matter of her brain deteriorating, and the only thing
we</B>
<P><B>could do is put her to sleep.  My mom loving that cat as much as she
did</B>
<P><B>, did not have the heart to do so.  So for two more nights I would
feel</B>
<P><B>her jump on the foot of my bed, and then in the middle of the night
I</B>
<P><B>would wake up again to her having convulsions until I comforted her</B>
<P><B>enough to fall asleep in my arms.  Finaly my mom had here put to
sleep</B>
<P><B>after that third night.  It was so hard for all of us to let her go,</B>
<P><B>afterall she had been with me for most of my life.  That night, after</B>
<P><B>putting her to sleep, I had my first experience.  After all these
years,</B>
<P><B>it is not what I expected my first encounter to be like, but it was
one</B>
<P><B>I will never forget.  I went to bed early that night, it was a long
day</B>
<P><B>for all of us to let her go.  At about 1:30am I woke up to feel
"momma</B>
<P><B>kitty" jump up on the bed.  She made her usual round on the end of
the</B>
<P><B>bed to find her "cumfy" spot and settled against my legs.  It didn't</B>
<P><B>take long before I realized that this should not be happening on this</B>
<P><B>night, we had just put her to sleep.  My first reaction was to
freeze,</B>
<P><B>and a cold swet swept up my back.  But after that I realized I
shouldn't</B>
<P><B>be scared, and a great feeling of comfort swept over me.  I smiled,
and</B>
<P><B>reached down where she should be and patted the area and told her I
love</B>
<P><B>her and will never forget her.  Although not the "horrifying"
experience</B>
<P><B>I thought it would be, it was very special.  It was her way of coming
to</B>
<P><B>me and thanking me for helping her all her last nights, and to let
me</B>
<P><B>know she would always be with me.......	"I LOVE YOU MOMMA KITTY"</B>

<H3>	<A NAME=death>My Grandmother's Death story</A>
</H3><P><B>by diana202@tld.net@tld2.tld.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>Hi. my name is Diana and day before my grandmother died in April,</B>
<P><B>something peculiar happened which I was told days later. My
grandmother,</B>
<P><B>had suffered from a couple of brain hemorrages which left her in a
very</B>
<P><B>bad state. He could not speak very well and had memory lapses. She
had</B>
<P><B>nurses in her house 24 hrs. a day who did everything for her and who</B>
<P><B>eventually grew very affectionate for my grandmother. One particular</B>
<P><B>nurse, Lourdes, had grown especially attatched to her and was the
nicest</B>
<P><B>of all the nurses. during this time, mu grandmother's health was not</B>
<P><B>progressing, but was pretty stable. </B>
<P><B>	A week before she died, Lourdes had not been able to nurse my</B>
<P><B>grandmother because she became sick. Immediately, my grandmother's</B>
<P><B>health decreased rapidly. She developed a bad case of pneumonia and
had</B>
<P><B>a very hard time breathing (she had to have all these machines
connected</B>
<P><B>to her all the time). The night before she passed on, Lourdes was in
her</B>
<P><B>bed praying for my grandmother. She was praying to God, and in a way</B>
<P><B>speaking to my grandmother, whispering the words "Everything is going
to</B>
<P><B>be just fine", "God is with you", etc. Now there is some kind of
prayer</B>
<P><B>which includes 7 "Our Fathers", which is supposed to represent
something</B>
<P><B>with Jesus and before he died, or something of the sort. Anyways, on</B>
<P><B>finishing the seventh "Our Father", she felt an incredible cold wind</B>
<P><B>come over her, making her still for about a minute. She then felt</B>
<P><B>someone come over her and lay in bed besides her. This feeling did
not</B>
<P><B>last very long, but then the "spirit" or whatever it was sleeping</B>
<P><B>besides her went away along with the rush of cold wind. The next</B>
<P><B>morning, my grandmother took her last breath and passed on next to
her</B>
<P><B>three sons sitting besides her bed. (my father and 2 aunts were
sitting</B>
<P><B>next to her bed holding hands). </B>
<P><B>	</B>
<P><B>	 The incident with Lourdes I wa told in her funeral and just
completely</B>
<P><B>shocked me. And after reading some of you're true ghost experiences,
I</B>
<P><B>just thought you'd might like to hear about this. </B>
<P><B>				Thank you for your time.</B>

<P><B>One of my friends committed suicide about 5 months ago. She killed
herself early one morning before school.  That night when I was just about
to fall asleep I  saw her standing in my doorway with the hall light on behind
her.  She came and sat on the end of my bed and I could feel the warmth of
her through my covers.  She said something but I couldn't hear her. Then
she just vanished.  The strange thing is I was the last one to go to sleep
that night and I turned off all the lights and closed my door before I went
to sleep just like I always do.  After she left I got up and closed the door
again, I know it wasn't a dream because the door to my room was oper and
the light was on when I woke up the next morning.</B>

<H3><A NAME=choppy>Choppy</A>
</H3><P><B>by PoloLau@sme.org</B>
<P>
<P><B>When I lived in North Carolina, my ex-husband and I recieved a letter</B>
<P><B>in the mail that was addressed to the people that used to live in the</B>
<P><B>apartment that we were occupying.  I shouldn't have opened it because
it</B>
<P><B>was clearly marked CONFIDENTAL in big red letters, but the name on
the</B>
<P><B>letter was very simular to my husbands so I opened it and I was
shocked</B>
<P><B>to see that it was an autopsy report.  Apparently there was a baby
that</B>
<P><B>has died of SIDS and being that I was pregnant and about ready to</B>
<P><B>deliver any day, I found it terribly disturbing.  Well, I had a girl
and</B>
<P><B>she was healthy beautiful, I never took my eyes off her, keeping her</B>
<P><B>near me at all times, often thinking of that baby that passed away.</B>
<P><B>Strange things started to happen when my daughter was born. For</B>
<P><B>instance, I always kept my daughter on her side with a big towel
rolled</B>
<P><B>up behind her afraid that she would go on her back and choke or go
on</B>
<P><B>her stomach and not be able to breathe.  Everytime she would roll in
an</B>
<P><B>awkward postion something would shake me awake.  Then things started
to</B>
<P><B>be misplaced and I would feel a presence in the apartment, also my
hair</B>
<P><B>dryer would go on by itself.  I got so shaken we moved down the
street,</B>
<P><B>but it came with us. I would hear a crying child in the night and
could</B>
<P><B>never tell where it came from.  As my daughter got older she played
by</B>
<P><B>herself for hours and I would hear her talking and laughing by
herself.</B>
<P><B>I often asked her who she was talking to and she would say that she
was</B>
<P><B>playing with "Choppy"  Well, Choppy was a huge part of our lives, my</B>
<P><B>daughter said he was a blonde little boy who didn't have feet he just</B>
<P><B>floated around and he was very kind.  My dog could see him, so could
my</B>
<P><B>daughter.  Doors would open and close, toys would move by themselves,</B>
<P><B>water would turn on and off, I thought I was going to go crazy!  Then</B>
<P><B>choppy started scaring me because he would let the dog out of the
yard</B>
<P><B>and try to get my daughter to go into the woods to play, I wouldn't
let</B>
<P><B>her and choppy got mad and started breaking my personal items.</B>
<P><B>We moved again, this time out of the state, and it has been a couple</B>
<P><B>years since I have heard anything from choppy, I even thought my</B>
<P><B>daughter forgot about him, until now, it seems choppy has found us
and</B>
<P><B>is back.  He doesn't like me very much and is breaking my personal</B>
<P><B>belongings again.  My daughter says it is him.  I don't know what to
do.</B>

<H3><A NAME=encounters>2 encounters</A>
</H3><P><B>by goldsac1@netcom.ca</B>
<P>
<P><B>When I was about 13 years old, I was standing at the top of the
stairs</B>
<P><B>at my stepmother's house.  From the top of the stairs on my right was
a</B>
<P><B>bedroom, on my left was a bedroom, down the hall where I was facing</B>
<P><B>there are two bedrooms one on each side of the hall.  There were two</B>
<P><B>lights on, the one behind me in the bathroom and the one at the end
of</B>
<P><B>the hall in my bedroom.  Otherwise it was dark.  I saw a figure,
black,</B>
<P><B>standing in my bedroom doorway.  It was an old woman her hair was</B>
<P><B>obviously frizzy and she was wearing a shawl.  It was told to me a
few</B>
<P><B>years previous that my greatstepgrandmother died in the very house.
 My</B>
<P><B>guess is that it was her, I was sleeping in her old bedroom and she</B>
<P><B>never liked my stepgrandmother.  I think she was trying to tell us
to</B>
<P><B>leave.</B>
<P><B>	Another time my mother told about an apparition that scared her very</B>
<P><B>badly.  She was lying in her waterbed, it was 3:25 am, she remembers</B>
<P><B>that because it was the only thing that she could see.   The reason
for</B>
<P><B>that was a colourful tornado like apparition pinned her to her bed
for a</B>
<P><B>full 30 minutes.  My mother also had many other encounters with
spirits</B>
<P><B>in her home, little things like lamps being moved, it would flick her
on</B>
<P><B>her shoulder etc.  It was really funny, in an ironic sort of way, one</B>
<P><B>day my mother stood in her kitchen and said really loud, "I wish this</B>
<P><B>fucking house would just burn down!" And well, a week later it did
burn</B>
<P><B>down.  A few years later they finished rebuilding a new house, it was</B>
<P><B>not in the exact same sight as the first house, but a portion of it
was</B>
<P><B>still on the old sight.  The same ghost, which my mother believes was
an</B>
<P><B>old man who died there, still haunted her house, but could only go
in</B>
<P><B>one half of the house.  Just thought you might be interested in a few</B>
<P><B>more stories.</B>

<H3><A NAME=fairchild>Fairchild, Wisconsin</A>
</H3><P><B>by bvanpatten@acronet.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>On a trip to Fairchild, Wisconsin we had the most terrifiying
experience</B>
<P><B>of our lives.  We're 23 and 24 and both hunt on my uncle's property.
 We</B>
<P><B>usually stay two or                                             
     three</B>
<P><B>nights.  We are completely surrounded by woods.  We have a generator
in</B>
<P><B>back so we have electricity.  It was late at night when we finally
got back</B>
<P><B>from bar hopping on the second night.  For some reason( This is where
the</B>
<P><B>ghost comes in ) we saw a bright light in the trailor.  We couldn't
hear</B>
<P><B>the generator running so we knew it was off.  We thought it might have
been</B>
<P><B>our imaginations, we had been drinking quite a bit.  We ventured closer
to</B>
<P><B>the trailor and saw something moving.  We ran and grabbed the .22 rifle
we</B>
<P><B>had left out.  Dominik ran in with the gun while I went to get our
cellular</B>
<P><B>phone and call the police.  Just as he entered the door the light went
out.</B>
<P><B> I ran in with a flashlight and nothing was there.  Dominik took the
gun</B>
<P><B>and went and turned on the generator.  We still saw nothing.  The
weirdest</B>
<P><B>part was our doors and windows are locked tight, so nothing could get
out,</B>
<P><B>yet the "intruder" managed to get out through locked windows and
doors</B>
<P><B>without unlocking them and without breaking anything.  We were at the</B>
<P><B>tavern the next day and described our story to the locals.They asked
us</B>
<P><B>where our place was so we told them.  A man came and told us about
a hunter</B>
<P><B>who had died there.  He was in a tree stand when he stood up to shoot
a</B>
<P><B>deer.  He slipped and fell out of the stand.  He supposedly died of
massive</B>
<P><B>head injuries.  They say he comes back during deer season to get the
deer</B>
<P><B>he missed that day.  I don't know if that story is true, but it does</B>
<P><B>explain a lot. </B>

<H3><A NAME=tenn>Haunting of My House in Tennessee</A>
</H3><P><B>by jolynnv@oakharbor.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>You know people I have told this to think my husband and I are a
little</B>
<P><B>crazy, but I can tell you things really did happen to us.  Weird
things,</B>
<P><B>like our ceiling lights falling out of the ceiling in the middle of
the</B>
<P><B>night or my husband thinking I was calling out to him when he was in
one</B>
<P><B>room and I was at the opposite end of the house asleep.  He swears
it was</B>
<P><B>my voice.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>Also, one night, not too long after my last child had gotten married
and</B>
<P><B>left the house, I got up in the middle of the night to use the
bathroom,</B>
<P><B>only I went to her bathroom instead of ours, as I sat down on the toilet
I</B>
<P><B>saw an image.  It was kind of like you see right after you turn off
the</B>
<P><B>television and it's dark in the room, only this was of a little girl</B>
<P><B>dressed like a period in the 1800's or earlier.  It only lasted a couple
of</B>
<P><B>seconds, so I didn't think anything of it until a couple of weeks later
I</B>
<P><B>was talking to my daughter and mentioned jokingly (for the first
time)</B>
<P><B>something about our resident ghost.  She said something that made my
hair</B>
<P><B>stand on end.  She said when she lived there she kept thinking she
heard a</B>
<P><B>childs voice.  I had said nothing about the ghost being what I saw
in the</B>
<P><B>bathroom.</B>
<P>
<P><B>There were also other things that happened like door knobs being
unscrewed,</B>
<P><B>my mother thought she saw someone walk past the living room door (which
is</B>
<P><B>right across the hall from the bathroom).  Also, my husband and I
were</B>
<P><B>sitting in the living room one day and we heard the closet door my</B>
<P><B>daughters old bedroom slam. </B>
<P>
<P><B>There are other things that happened in that period (approximately
6</B>
<P><B>months).  The one thing I thought of was we lived right on the
Mississippi</B>
<P><B>River and maybe some child had died and was buried on our property.
 </B>
<P><B>Anyway, that is my theory.</B>

<H3><A NAME=parsonage>Our Haunted Parsonage</A>
</H3><P><B>by 3ofus@netunlimited.net</B>
<P>
<P><B>We moved into this house in Walkertown, North Carolina in June, 1996.</B>
<P><B>The first week, Lou, my husband, was out side on the porch where you
can</B>
<P><B>see the tiny fellowship hall above the church and next to the
cemetery.</B>
<P><B>He was out on the porch one night and saw 2 of the windows had a red</B>
<P><B>glow. He looked around to see where it was coming from, but there is</B>
<P><B>nothing that around that would cast a glow like that. He could not</B>
<P><B>explain it.</B>
<P><B>And another time, Lou was in the bath room, which is right next to
the</B>
<P><B>kitchen where the front door is. While in there, he heard the screen</B>
<P><B>open, close and three heavy footsteps. He checked the house, and no
one</B>
<P><B>was here.  We live in a parsonage, a house for the preacher of the</B>
<P><B>church and there is a small cemetery on the same property.</B>
<P><B> I have smelled smoke throughout the house, and no one smokes in the</B>
<P><B>house, I have seen very detailed lights that are unexplainable.  Once
I</B>
<P><B>was going into the basement to bring up the clothes from the dryer,
and</B>
<P><B>I felt very cold and got goose bumps on my arms and legs while
walking</B>
<P><B>down the stairs. I sensed that someone was walking very closely
behind</B>
<P><B>me. When I turned around, no one was there. I felt panicked and
didn't</B>
<P><B>know what else to do, so I half-way screamed, "Please stop walking
so</B>
<P><B>close behind me!" And the sensation immediately went away. That same</B>
<P><B>night, the kids went out to a friend's house for the evening. I was</B>
<P><B>cooking dinner and I got that same chill and the goose bumps. I heard</B>
<P><B>the screen door open and was thankful that the kids come back,
thinking</B>
<P><B>they had probably forgotten something.</B>
<P><B>I leaned over to open the door for them, cause they didn't have a key</B>
<P><B>and there was no one there, but what ever was opening the screen door</B>
<P><B>must have gotten too close to me or something, because I felt like
I</B>
<P><B>received some kind of a shock...it wasn't like an electrical shock,
or</B>
<P><B>static. I have been thinking of a way to explain this feeling, and
there</B>
<P><B>are absolutely no words that I can think of. Afterwards, I felt
drained</B>
<P><B>of all my energy, and still, two days after, was still sluggish.</B>
<P><B>The night before, I saw a light come in from  underneath the kitchen</B>
<P><B>door and go into our pantry.  This was not a light that could have
been</B>
<P><B>a reflection, this was very small and well defined, like a cylinder
that</B>
<P><B>was narrow at the beginning and flared out at the end.  It was maybe
8</B>
<P><B>inches long. </B>
<P><B>After I had gotten off the computer that night from writing a letter
to</B>
<P><B>Hauntings Today, about the parsonage we found out was  obviously</B>
<P><B>haunted, I popped a video tape of Forrest Gump and tried to unwind.
</B>
<P><B>Near the end of the movie, about 11pm - about a half an hour before
my</B>
<P><B>husband got off from work, the door in the living room began to open
and</B>
<P><B>close by itself!  I wanted to run out side, but I was new to the
area,</B>
<P><B>didn't know my way around, besides, where could I go?  Of course I
was</B>
<P><B>in a panic.  I stayed in the kitchen, near the front door in case</B>
<P><B>something else started.  That way, at least I was close to a door that
I</B>
<P><B>could run out of. (Like that was going to do any good!)</B>
<P>
<P><B>A few months later, my daughter Julie and some of her friends went</B>
<P><B>outside on the porch and were talking, it was just before midnight
on</B>
<P><B>New Years Eve.  Across from the porch is the graveyard. She and her</B>
<P><B>girlfriend saw what looked like a man leaning on one of her favorite</B>
<P><B>grave stones.  She frequently walks over there and places flowers on
his</B>
<P><B>grave and spends time talking to him.  She calls him 'Grandpa'.  He
was</B>
<P><B>a W.W.II Veteran. She told me that this `see-through' thing that</B>
<P><B>resembled a person was just watching her, smoking a cigarette, and
he</B>
<P><B>waved at her.   Her friend saw him too.  Kind of makes me wonder if
he</B>
<P><B>wasn't the one in the house, smoking.  Julie said that she felt as
if he</B>
<P><B>was just watching over her.  </B>
<P>
<P><B>A few months ago in the living room, (next to the door that was
opening</B>
<P><B>and closing on its own accord last summer) the lamp on the table
began</B>
<P><B>to `dance around'. First the shade started moving, then the base of
the</B>
<P><B>lamp was kind of hopping...? I thought maybe the cat was tangled up
in the</B>
<P><B>cord, but he was asleep near the couch, well away from the cord.</B>
<P>
<P><B>One night my daughter's friend was spending the night. They were
laying</B>
<P><B>on the bed talking late that night when the door opened from a
latched</B>
<P><B>position for a few seconds, then closed and latched again.   </B>
<P>
<P><B>I don't think that it wants to hurt us, if it did I guess it would
be</B>
<P><B>throwing things at us or something.  That summer was the scariest and</B>
<P><B>most intense thing I have EVER been through, and this summer, even</B>
<P><B>though there are many paranormal things going on, I'm not as scared</B>
<P><B>about it as I was.</B>
<P>
<P><B>I have had many experiences with this sort of thing since I was a
child,</B>
<P><B>but nothing so obvious as it has been with this house.  Everything
has</B>
<P><B>been quiet for the past few weeks now, but as most paranormal
happenings</B>
<P><B>that occur in my life, they will no doubt begin again.  It seems to
be</B>
<P><B>just a matter of time.</B>
