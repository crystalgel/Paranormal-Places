<p class="MsoNormal"><big><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"><big>Are orbs
evidence that spirits are present?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>No.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Are orbs actually
spirits?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Orbs are nothing but dust and airborne
debris!<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yes, or at least that is the
case in many photos.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Surprised to hear
me saying this?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Don&#8217;t be.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Orbs are the source of the most contentious
debates in this field of research yet orbs are the least important pieces of
evidence that can be collected.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
have been enough studies conducted including my own experiments that the skeptics
are right, dust and some airborne debris can look very similar to orbs in
photos.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Many investigators can&#8217;t tell
the difference and this can be a problem for novices as well as experienced
researchers.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given all of these facts,
why do we see lots of orb photos all over the place?<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Simply put, it is the easiest visible
evidence to collect and to display.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
am guilty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I still post orb photos in
the gallery and on my investigation pages in order to have something visible to
go along with the case history and my findings.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We are very visual based society so adding
photos adds something extra to the words.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It does not mean though that the orb photos are the most important
pieces of evidence.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This is a major
misconception.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I like to add the
positive orb photos that correlate with other events like equipment readings or
psychic impressions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I also do it for a
deeper reason.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I want people who are
having problems with a haunting in their home related to the homes they see
pictured on my investigation pages.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>When they see a home that reminds them of their own it can alleviate
some of the anxiety that may be holding them back from contact me for
help.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>They can see that we have helped
people who live in regular homes just like theirs.</big><o:p></o:p></span></big></p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"><big>So why do
we use orbs as evidence at all?<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My
research has led me to believe that orbs are balls of energy that are visible
in the area of light between visible light and infrared light.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We know that orbs are real since there have
been experiments in laboratory conditions that have produced unexplainable orbs
in photos.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Orbs can be found all over
the place so it is possible that you can take a photo in your home and get an
orb or two in it.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This does not mean
that you have a ghost.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It does mean
that you have a couple of these balls of energy in your photo, period.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The reason we can use orbs I as one small
form of evidence that their may be spirit activity is that orbs are found in
higher percentages in areas that have spirit activity or unexplained activity
present.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How they relate to spirits is
unknown.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whether they are precursors to
spirits, are drawn to spirits, etc. is still to be discovered.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I hope that you will view the orb photos
posted on websites in a different light now.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>I encourage everyone to put the emphasis on orbs in conjunction with
other readings or events occurring at the same time and to look for the overall
percentages of positive photos higher than 3% - 4% as basic evidence and not
glorify the single orb photo as proof positive of a ghost.<span style="">&nbsp; <br>
