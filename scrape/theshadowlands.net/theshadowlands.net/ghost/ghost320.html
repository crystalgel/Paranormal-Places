style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I had my best friend,
Brittany, over. We were both sitting on our giant couch in our den. We were
watching t.v. when the wall opposite of us started to shake. We first looked at
each other and asked the other if they say that. I mean you could literally see
the wall shake. We had a candle holder mounted on the wall and it fell off. At
first we thought it was an earthquake. But it wasn't since it was that one wall
and only that one wall. We just shrugged it off not knowing what it could have
been. Well I told my parents and they said it could have been our dogs. Now I
know that couldn't be false because we have 3 huge dogs. 2 akitas and a st.
bernard and they fight and rumble sometimes which causes things to bump. But I
knew it wasn't them because there was a banging on the roof and they couldn't
have hit the house so hard to knock the candle holder off. From my friends and
neighbors on our block we've heard that someone jumped off our roof and killed
themselves. But that was never disclosed to us, only that the previous owner
was an elderly woman who had a heartattack and was rushed to the hospital where
she later died. I still don't know what to believe, but I think that it's a possibility
that it was the ghost re-enacting his death.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I've experienced many
things over the years in different homes.... My first recollection of something
odd was in the apt building we lived in for 13 years.....the basement was
divided into 3 sections: there was a small apt for the superintendent, an area
to wash clothes for the tenants and the boiler room...the superintendent was a
quiet man ..he kept to himself; in the summertime he liked to sit in the boiler
room -(which had a small back door that led into the alleyway) -, smoking his
cigarettes and listening to the classic oldies radio station...long story
short: he passed away in the local hospital but still liked to visit his
favorite spot.... from time to time you could smell cigarettes;<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>hear the music faintly and if you were quick
enough you could catch a<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>wisp of smoke
in the air from those cigarettes but as soon as you turned on the light there
would be nothing<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Later on we moved to a
one family house that was located over an embroidery...there were 2 presenses:
I could clearly hear 2 sets of footsteps padding on the carpet..I never really
&quot;saw&quot; them...more like sensed that one was small or young in age and
a bit mischievious...he would bump the end of my bed when I was laying on it
listening to music....the other was larger...I was not quite sure what to make
of this other one; just that it scared me...the hair on my neck would stand up
and my skin would get goosebumps when it was within 10 feet of me...also it
seemed to&quot; reside&quot; in the family room at night...right above where
the heavy cutting machines in the embroidery where kept....My family went on
vacation and wasn't able to go with them..although I arranged to sleep over a
family member's home there were 2 occasions where I wound up having to stay
home<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My room was always a &quot;safe
haven&quot; for me; whatever was in the family room never ventured into my
room...on those 2 nights that I had to stay home I was suddenly stricken with
such a fear...such anxiety...I felt that if I did not get out of my room at
that very moment I was going to die...of course I didn't actually believe this
it was just the feeling I had at that moment...and I wound up sleeping in the
family room -of all places! However from my room I heard noises such as the
boards creaking and the closet doors moving back and forth...<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Walking home one night I noticed the light on
in the family room window and saw someone leaning on the window sill ..I assumed
it was my mother waiting up for me to be sure I got home safe...but when I came
upstairs I found that the lights were off and that everyone was asleep--I know
this for a fact because I had to wake them to tell them I was home...so who was
in the window?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>    </span>On another
occasion<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>my mother decided to sleep in
the sofabed because the bedroom was too hot...she started calling for my father
frantically.......Later that morning she would tell me of how she heard
footsteps and then felt the sheet lift up and feel the mattress sink in where
someone had gotten in .....she thought that it was my father coming to join her
on the sofabed and reached over to put her arm around him only to feel cold air
and nothing else and then started calling for my father convinced that someone
was in the house with us and a search of every door and window proved that it
was impossible because they where locked<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Eventually we moved to a
new home...brand new construction....in central jersey<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>For the first few years things seemed
fine...well they still are fine... however I am sure that we have had a few
passersby...I have felt that bumping of the bed on occasion...and there had
been a knocking in the wall for a while ...at first I was the only one who
noticed it....then one morning around 5 am<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>the knocking started with such force that my parents jumped out of bed
and came running thinking that it was me trying to call for help by banging on
the wall...my father searched everywhere but could not find the source or a
cause for the sound. On another occasion my little sister came home from her
ccd classes and she had been chosen to bring a statue of the virgin Mary home
to&quot; visit&quot;.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We had Her for a
week until my sister's next class at which time Mary would go home with someone
else Every night during that week we would sit around Her and recite the rosary
and every night I would feel that there was another being in the room aside
from my family ...I had the distinct feeling that the visitor was a she and
that she seemed to take comfort in hearing the prayers...I have also heard
footsteps across the floors....However nothing has happened since
then...incidentally..the house over the embroidery burned down to the
ground<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>2 years after we moved out
...with the exception of the intruder in mom's bed and that horrible banging
noone else has ever noticed anything...my dad says I have a vivid imagination
and he refuses to believe in such things but I'm pretty sure my mind's a little
more open to things because it has happened on a few occasions where I have
&quot;known&quot; things before they happened... I guess that is also why I've
sensed these things as well.... my mom has also had visits from her
grandmother...once on the last night of her viewing<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>( she passed away ) many years ago when mom
was in her early teens and then again 5 years ago....I feel that both times
were because she sensed the my mom was going through some emotional
crisis...the first time obviously due to her grandmother's passing ....The
latter has an interesting twist to it...mom was again going through much heart
ache and grief during a family crisis and she told me that one night she as
though there were a cold hand on her back squeezing her spine and she remembers
feeling very scared and paralyzed...unable to move even if she tried
to.....then she saw her grandmother at the foot of the bed but she looked very
angry almost furious and mom says she remembers thinking that maybe her
grandmother was mad at her...however she says that when her grandmother
appeared she felt warm and safe again and that cold, squeezing feeling was
gone.....another family member said in response to this story that maybe mom
attracted some negative energy with all her sadness and grief and that her
grandmother came back to protect her<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>

style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I've had many ghosts
experiences through the 14 years I've been on this earth. But my first happened
at the 2nd house I lived at. My younger sister and I used to share a room,
she's always rocked and made noise. Well 1 night I was asleep and she started
crying and rocking in her crib. I couldn't stand the noise and needed my sleep
for school the next day. So I grabbed my blanket and pillow, went into our &quot;living
room&quot; and crashed out on the couch. <o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I awoke to a strange
presence that something was watching me. I opened my eyes and across from me on
our brown chair<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>was a hazy<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>yet solid figure. I can only describe him as
well dressed. A gray suit, a tie, buzz cut, and a mustache. He sort of looked
like my grandfather (who had passed away) I couldn't believe what I was seeing
so I shut my eyes and opened them again. He was still there. He just sat there
staring back at me. After awhile I started to fall asleep again. I didn't have
any nightmares. But I woke up to the door of our garage being opened. I looked
around and the figure was gone. I later discussed it with my parents. They said
that wierd stuff happened in that house to them too. They told me that they
woke up to our back door being shut. That they thought it was me letting out
the dog. But I was sound asleep in my bed. Out of all my experiences this one I
can't forget. I found out later on about the history of the house. The old man
who lived there before us died of a heartattack. He was kind to all the kids of
the neighborhood, his wife had already passed on and he was just waiting for
his time to go.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

in town or is it outside the immediate Middletown area?<span

what went down at Amity Hall....<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Three friends and I went
up late after checking out Middletown's cemetarys.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I guess it was around 1 am on a Sunday
night.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We sat in the parking lot and
killed the headlights and the engine.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We
saw a few orbs but the most significant one was bluish and near the car.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was changing shape, sometimes
disappearing, and flickerking, becoming brighter.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We were also pretty sure we were catching the
&quot;imps&quot; refered to on the shadowlands site out the corner of our eyes
though we can't be too sure.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I went back a few days
later with another friend and the one guy who was with us when we saw the
orb.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I have a Chihuahua puppy and he
goes everywhere with me that's legal -so he was on my lap sleeping.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Not much was happening, we were all talking
about stupid stuff, non -ghost related and my puppy, (Tito) woke up and started
to look around.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>While my friends were
talking, I heard a noise in the distance, at first it seemed like dogs barking
a few miles away but then it became clear that they were voices!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My friend noticed as well and we'd heard the
voices again, and then again right after, each time getting closer to the
car.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I wasn't driving this time so my
friend decided to pull out of the parking lot and get outta there.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When we pulled out of the parking lot the
voices stopped.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Then as we were at the
stop sign right by the place, we heard RIGHT OUTSIDE THE CAR what sounded like
giggles.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was so loud!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was like they were right outside the window!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It sounded like teenagers but definetly a
young woman and some other muffled voices that were less obvious.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We peeled away from the stop sign, the
giggles followed along side the car for a few more yards, then were gone.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I've been back up, trying to witness or hear
more but have had no luck.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Those were
the only times ever in the years I have been checking the place out, that I'd
ever noticed anything out of the ordinary.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I recommend checking it out soon!<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Today, the same usual
friend I go ghost hunting with, Nate, (who was with me both times at Amity Hall
by the way), was along with me and Tito to check out Gettysburg.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We got there around 6 pm and it was getting
dark pretty fast.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We drove around the
battlefield then decided to get out at Devil's Den.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I was walking with Nate and holding Tito on
the street above the boulder formation.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The three of us heard something strange behind us in the woods, apart
from the people we heard below us on the rocks.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Just as we turned to look in the direction of the noise, we heard what
sounded like a body or maybe a canon ball? crashing down through the
trees.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I ran! haha<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It gave Tito a start too.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I decided I'd already had enough so we walked
back down the little path by the area where the dead soldier was &quot;posed&quot;
for a picture.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We were at the corner of
Devil's Den that is further away from Little Round Top and I looked over beside
me to see a bright blue light between two sandwiched boulders.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was a very obvious shade of blue and just
as I was about to comment, Nate confirmed what I'd been looking at.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Again, all the times I have been ghost
hunting in that area, and this was the first time I'd experienced
anything.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Maybe it's just me lately,
being more in tune or something really has the spirit world stirred up!<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I called yet another friend to tell her about
the orb and she told me that after the last time she and I had visited
Gettysburg, her digital camera stopped working completely.<span

style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>As a start, I'd like to
say that I've been a frequent visitor for 2-3 years, and been very interested
in what I've read.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>But to start my story; I
will need to give you a bit of background knowledge of the place. Dragsholm
Castle is one of Denmarks most haunted places. There are 3 famous ghosts, and
an unknown number beside these. The first one is the Earl of Bothwell, who was
a captive at the castle, and died there. The second is a white lady, who was
trapped in a little room in the wall, as she had gotten pregnant with a man
from the local village. The third is a grey lady, who keeps the place in order.
Besides, the halls are haunted by a white stallion, who - the history say - was
taken to see it's owner, who was dying. But it went berserk in the halls and
had to be shot. In the castle, there is also a theater (this is not related to
the story, but pretty interesting...). Back in the days when it was used, they
would use people who had been convicted for crimes and had to be executed, if
they needed some fighting on stage. This meant that a lot of people were
murdered in the theater, and the staff in the castle claims that there are at
least 20-30 ghosts in that area of the castle.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Now, the story... I and
my GF was at a medieval-party in the castle, which is now a hotel. We went to
bed early (around 01.30) in our room in the northern wing of the castle. The
castle is surrounded by a moat, and was only open towards the north side.
Unfortunately, the swedes attacked from the south some time in the 17. century (I
believe), and was able to cross the moat and get in to the castle's courtyard. <o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>The room we were staying
in was directly at the top of the staircase, which was no more than 50-70 cm.
wide (two people couldn't pass eachother), and was one of three entrances to
the north wing. As I told you, we went to bed early, and the rest continued
their party. During the night, we heard people walking the stairs several
times, and in the end we got quite annoyed - we thought that it was some of the
other guests going to bed, and being quite noisy. What struck us, was that we
never heard anyone talk, just the footsteps on the stairs.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>The next morning when we
got up, we found out that we were one of only 3 or 4 couples who lived in that
part of the castle, and at least two couples lived on the ground floor... We
did not see any thing, but we sure heard it...<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Hello! My name is Teela,
I have several stories that I have experienced over the years. My first one was
when I first moved to Indiana, from Florida. The people that my husband and I
bought the house from had a little girl of about 7 or 8 years old. She choked
to death in my youngest daughters room. After a couple of months of being here,
everything was pretty normal and after that it started changing. The first
incident I noticed was, I was in the bathroom getting ready to take a shower
and I was just getting in there, and i was taking off my jewerly and I noticed
the door knob kind of jilting back and forth. I dismissed it, thinking that my
oldest daughter(4 years old) at the time, was playing a trick on me. All of a
sudden I heard a tapping noise that of tap shoes, when I started for the door
the noise in a way kind of took off running. I went to check and see if it was
my oldest daughter, when i checked she was fast a sleep. I asked my step son if
he had heard that noise and he said that he never heard anything. The 2nd
incident, I didnt see but my daughter and step son saw. They had taken are
dog,Peanut, outside to use the restroom. When the 2 came back inside they
walked in through the back door and where they were standing it went straight
threw into my office. Well the dog started barking like crazy, and the two of
them said that they had seen a little girl, in a foggy white color, look
directly at them and then took off running through the wall that lead to the
outside of the house. The 3rd incident happened<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>fter my family and i returned from eating out. The ceiling was dripping
with water from a leak in the roof. I had placed a bucket on the top of a
cabinet and there was no way the buck could possibly fall off, we were all
standing in the kitchen and all of a sudden the bucket just flew and slammed
onto the ground. This is a few of the things that had been happen around my
home.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>When we first moved in
my house on Navajo in San Francisco , everything seemed normal . We all felt
safe and nothing seemed off or weird . On 2000, we started to encounter odd
sightings and sounds at the house. My mom was doing laundry in the garage , usually
she only has one light on but this time she turned both of the garage lights on
. As she was getting the clouds from the dryer , she saw a young teenage boy
standing near a parked car we had inside . He slowly moved toward the garage
door and disappeared . Later on a few weeks past , we didn't make much of it .
One night , my sister was sleeping alone in her room . It was just me and her
at home . I had been watching tv with the mute on waiting for my parents to
come home . Then I saw the door knob slowly move , I had the door locked
and<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I could look under and no one was
there . The following day I woke up with bruise marks on my arm. After that ,
my sister had felt and saw someone all in black sitting at the edge of her bed.
My brother had seen<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>the same young boy
my mom saw downstairs in the guest room we have . After my sister got married ,
she and her husband stayed with us . Everynight , she recalled being awakened
by someone . She would feel like someone was laying next to her on the opposite
de of where her husband was and touching her . It got worser that we had to
call a spirit channel person . She took the ghost away . But it wasn't over .
Everynight in my room , I see objects changed from place or things on the floor
when i havent touched anything . I've heard repeated voices calling my name ,
knocks on my door , someone walking in the kitchen , turning on the faucet .
The last sighting i saw was at night . It was 10 pm . No one was home but me .
I was doing exercisese and I turned around and I saw a women standing at the
doorway for my kitchen as i winked and blinked , i saw the faucet running and i
felt a cold chill , when it was REALLY hot weather that day too .Whatever it is
, it just wont leave til it gets its message across.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

a half of a block away there is a supposibly abandoned house. when we was
walking past it i looked up at the upstairs window and i saw a figure in the
window. i told my sister to look and she saw it too. we stood there watching
it. it was a human shape but you could see right through it. I started to get a
very ad feeing and just at that moment it moved its hand like it was pointing.
i began to leave, i told them to come and i looked back up at it and it just
vanished! it did not take us long to run to my house. People that i tell this

months.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>My house is very old.
Dates back to the 1800's. After a short time we started to notice strange
happenings and sounds. Footsteps, whispering, thumps and slamming doors. Let me
first say that these things are unnerving for other reasons then the obvious,
that it is a ghost, but is also frightening because you can never be sure if it
is ONLY a ghost or that someone is actually breaking into your home. Which is
something I fear more than the dead. The dead aren't going to steal your t.v.
or kidnap your children. Ghost I can live with, I just hate it when they are so
damn noisey.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Ok, story time. My
husband works 3rd shift, so I am often alone at night in the house. When I can,
I opt for company, usually a family member will stay with me. One night my
husband was leaving for work and with our children away (remember that part) I
asked my cousin, Nicole to stay with me. Eric, my hubby, was doing his usually
routine of running about getting ready and saying his goodbyes. As he was leaving
he kissed me and said &quot;Bye baby, I love you, I'll see you tomorrow
morning.&quot;, which I said right back to him. He said &quot;Later
Nicole&quot; and she waved good bye to him also. This was the normal run of
things EXCEPT for the abscence of our daughters who are usually the last to say
good bye to their daddy. Eric exited the backdoor. A few seconds later Nicole
and I heard the voice of a child eminating from upstairs say &quot;bye
daddy&quot;. It was as clear as a bell and as real as me or you. I looked over at
Nicole who was just staring ahead with a frozen look of fear on her face. I of
course said &quot;Did you hear that?!?&quot; even though I knew she did just by
the look on her face. She said &quot;Yeah I did, but I don't want to talk about
it until morning.&quot; I think we were both a little freaked out for the rest
of the night. We had known that the house was haunted, but we did not expect
actual interaction with them.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>My second experience
happened just a few weeks ago. I told you my husband, Eric, works the a late
shift and so he usually sleeps during the day while our daughters are in
school. On that particular day I had a few errands to run, so my sister,
Maggie, decided she would tag along and we would go have lunch together. We
were away from the house for about 3 hours and when we arrived home we entered
the backdoor that leads to my kitchen so we would not disturb my husband who
was fast asleep on the couch in our living room. As it happens our kitchen is
seperated from the rest of the house by a big wooden, swinging door that leads
to our dinning room. Now please note that when we shut the back door in the
kitchen the air from it will cause a suction and make the swinging door swing
back and forth on it's hinges. I am used to this seeing it happen so many
times. As I said we entered the backdoor, Maggie going in first and sitting
some groceries down on the kitchen table, I came in last, sat down my things
and proceeded in shutting the door behind me. I automatically look up (as did
Maggie) to see the swinging door moving on it's hinges, no biggie I knew what
caused it, but as the door swung outward I saw a man standing about 6 inches
away from the door frame. He then grabbed the door and held for about 3 seconds
and just stood there looking back at me. I gasped and he let the door go. I
told Maggie to get out of the house, that I saw a man in the dinning room and
without a phone in that room (there is no phone jack there due to the fact that
my dog decided to eat it) I did the dumbest thing I could, I grabbed the
nearest object which was the frying pan I had fixed scrambled eggs in that
morning. I then did what came natural and holding the frying pan out in front
of me I pushed through the swinging door using every stealthy move I had ever
seen on all those cop shows! I know it sounds funny now but I was so scared,
all I could think was there was someone in my house and my hubby was asleep on
that couch! I pressed my back to the swinging door so if anyone was standing
behind they would be flattened to the wall, in which case if they were I guess
I could've smacked them one with the frying pan, but who knows, I was running
on pure adrenaline! I then ran to the living room looking all directions at
once and woke my husband. We searched every room and found nothing. I told Eric
exactly what the man looked like, I seen him plain as day. There was no trace
of any forced entry of any kind. I have never been so terrified in all my life.
It was like the man had vanished. I am still not sure what to think of it.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>We lived in a house in
the country in Frederick OK that was most definitely haunted. We lived there
for two years before moving here to Sallisaw OK. The way to get to that house
is pretty easy as the dirt roads are in mile sections. Right across from a
store called ALCO is a paved road. You take it to the first intersection and
turn right onto a dirt road. You take it down to the following intersection and
turn left. At the next intersection you turn right again. The house sits on the
lefthand side of the road. It is now abandoned, as I am sure no one dares to
live in it. We are not ordinary people, as we have seen and lived in haunted
houses before, as we go back to Frederick on a regular basis, we keep up with
the old house.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Some other people know
about it, but few are brave enough to enter it. I'm just curious as to what
tragedy happened there to cause such violent spirits to inhabit it. We know it
was a family home for generations, and that the kitchen was redesigned for a
crippled woman at one time, so the counters are shorter than normal. We also
know it was abandoned for 15 yea before we found it and renovated it. When we
discovered it, it was in very bad shape, no running water, windows broken out,
it was in severe disrepair, but we worked on it a bit and moved in.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The very first night there I heard a sound in
the attic like a child would make of about two years old. This wasn't no
squirrel, man! The kids heard it too and were scared.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>We saw a small child
periodically with blonde hair and very blue eyes. He is very pale and I sensed
evil coming from him.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>There are seven spirits
in all in the house, at least that's what we believe, whether there are more or
not, we don't know.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>My son saw a car driving
down the road that looked like it had been underwater. He said it was rusty and
it had a devil head on the license plate. We believed him because he was
frightened very badly.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>We also saw demonic looking creatures in the
girls bedroom. They had bodies like men but hooves like a goat, I am not joking
about any of this, you could check it out for yourselves, their eyes were red
and they were pure evil, some of their heads looked like deer heads, others
looked like partial skeleton cow heads with big thick rounded horns. They
terrified the girls and they said they couldn't wake us up when they saw them.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Sometimes the gas to the
propane heater we had would be turned on full blast when we woke up, or the
stove. Sometimes they would hurl objects in the dining room, open drawers,
throw knives and forks and spoons, whatever they felt like doing.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>I know I may sound crazy, but I am not lying.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>The most trouble was in
the attic. We were going to make our room up there, but never did, because the
hauntings were the worst up there. You could also feel things touch or tap you.
There were very cold spots in the house even in summer when the temperature was
108. <o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The year we moved out (we left a lot of our
stuff there when we moved, as we moved in a hurry) we went back to see what
stuff we might retrieve and the house looked like it was well cared for (there
were even new cars in the driveway) the house looked painted, looked like it
had new screen on the porch and everything. So I thought somebody had moved in,
but I found out later that the house was never inhabited again after we left
it.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>That was five years ago.
Just recently we went back (my brother lives there and we got a group together
and went out there together after dark) and took some sceptics with us, about
nine o'clock. I wasn't sure if anything would happen that early because when we
lived there things generally didn't happen much until about eleven at night or
later, sometimes they did, even in the daytime, but mostly after eleven.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>When we got out there
there were lights on in the house. One in the dining room and another in the
living room. They went out as soon as we drove into the driveway. We were
afraid that someone else might be out there, so we cautiously walked around the
house shining our flashlights into the windows. There wasn't anybody there. It
was empty and there was nowhere for them to go that fast.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>When we entered through
the front door ( it was standing wide open) it was eerie because most of the
stuff we left was still in the house. In the closet that leads up to the attic,
my youngest daughter's name, Alysia, still remains in crayon.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>When we entered the
dining room ( a real hot spot ) something touched my ear with a force. I
thought it was my sister in law just messing with me, but she was scared and
said it wasn't her. She felt something slide in between us when it happened.
They will never go back to the house. That's what they said. We all felt pretty
freaked out, and to tell you the truth, I felt I was in mortal danger. I don't
know why they wanted to hurt me so bad, but I know they did. <o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Also, before we moved
out, my son, then twelve, saw an army of what looked like zombies around our
house. We could hear drums, like BOOM, BOOM,BOOM, BOOM, and then a drum roll
and then over again, outside the house. He says he could hear them marching
like an army around our house. He says it sounded like a battle when they got
there. All we heard was the drums, but they were pretty scary by themselves.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Well, that is all I can really remember about
it, at least all the major stuff. We took pictures the night we went there, but
I don't have them developed yet.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>We might have a good
photo, I don't know, but as we were leaving, we took a picture of the attic
window because all of us saw a man standing up there by it. Also, my niece has
a vcr tape they made at an earlier time in the house, and they claim you can
see little white things floating around in the dining room, but I don't have
the video of that.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I swear that every bit
of this, as unbelievable as it may seem, is true. If you don't believe me, go
to the house. I gave good directions on how to get there<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

hometown in Michigan after being away for many years.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I have many stories to share, but this is a
recent one that stands out.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>A fixture in my town was
a burly guy named Bronco.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Bronco was the
typical bar bouncer-type (not surprisingly, this was his usual job).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>When I was younger, he used to drive this
Blue Ford Bronco.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My family knew him
well, as my mom ran the after bar breakfast restaurant, where all the party
people congregated when the bars closed.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Since I had moved away years before, I lost touch with the old 'party
crowd.'<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I DID hear, however, that Bronco
sold his beloved truck a few years after I moved.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Anyway, it was June of
2002 (I think) and I was driving on I94.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I saw Bronco's old blue truck driving on the opposite lane and mentioned
it to the person who was in the car with me.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>I hadn't seen Bronco in a few years, but knew I would undoubtedly run
into him at our upcoming 'Venetian Festival' and would mention the sighting to
him then.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span

the far side of the bar.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I raised an
eyebrow at him and he acknowledged me in his cocky way from across the room.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My friend and I went to look for a place to
sit--once we found a table I told my friend that I saw Bronco and wanted to go
say hi and tell him that I spotted his old truck the week before.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>As I made my way thru the crowd to the bar, I
heard the band dedicating a song.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

whimsically titled book, “The Everything Ghost Book”<span

personal occurrences, both psychic and paranormal. I did not realize until this
moment that they are, in all likelihood, related , at least in as much as I
have a “connection” or ability, or any number of<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>adjectives to describe the occurrences in my
life. It seems to be all about energy and about<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>opening one’s awareness of the energies around them. Well I don’t know
about that but what I do know is that since I was a child I was convinced of
the “other world”. I did not have many experiences but they were profound. I
remember them as if they occurred last week. I wish to document them in this
personal account, if for no other reason than to have them, perhaps in their
place. For a sense of continuity I will describe them in chronological order,

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Let me preface this
story with this fact that there have been many tales on both my mother’s and my
father’s side of “ghostly” sightings or occurrences but because I did not
witness any of them first hand I believe that they really have no place here.
However, if these things are familial, ie: run in families , all the more
reason to believe that my experiences were valid.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>One night when I was 12
years old my mother , my sister and myself<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>were alone in our house . It was not a typical place for a “haunting”;
it was a typical 50’s<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>three bedroom ranch
built three years after I was born. My sister was sound asleep in one of the
bedrooms; she was 5 years old. My dad was out for the evening at his monthly
card club meeting. It was around 8pm and my mom and I were sitting in the
kitchen enjoying some spareribs. Our dog, a poodle named Tessie, was asleep at
our feet.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We began hearing a noise from
the living room which was adjacent to the kitchen. At first it was not
discernible but then it became clear that it sounded like someone in our
overstuffed chair was snoring. It was very localized to that chair and crescendoed
into a very loud snoring sound. It was not like any other sound. It went on for
several minutes and my mom and I were very frightened. I started crying and the
sound immediately stopped. For several minutes we were simply stunned. Then we
started trying to “explain” what had happened. We checked on my sister who was
quietly sleeping in her bedroom. The dog had never stirred. We opened the front
door which was not far from the chair and hoped against hope that the
neighbor’s dog would be found there sleeping. We checked the HiFi stereo which
was off. The TV was off. We simply could not figure it out. We went back into
the kitchen and the cold ribs were just not appetizing anymore. Several minutes
later, as we were talking about what had happened, it started again. Only this
time it became very loud very quickly and this time the sound seemed almost
deafening. It again was very distinctively that of a person snoring coming from
the same chair. I became hysterical and grabbed my coat, screaming that I was
getting out of the house and going to the neighbors’. As my mom tried to stop
me and my hand was on the doorknob to exit, the snoring suddenly stopped. We
never heard it again, nor did anything more ever happen in that house that was
significant to me. She told me the next day that she was convinced that the
snoring had been that of her deceased father who had always had a propensity
for snoring loudly and she told me that that was the chair that he had sat in
during the one and only visit that he had made to my mom and dad in that house.
My grandfather’s relationship with both of them was strained to say the least
so I never remember him visiting with us. He had died a few months prior to
this “haunting”. My mother and I both occasionally recollect that night with
the same vivid details and we are both grateful that there were the two of us
to validate the story. <o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I was working as a nurse
on a medical-surgical unit at Greenville Hospital. I was always the “charge”
nurse on this unit and often worked the evening turn. As I made my drive to
work on afternoon in 1981 I suddenly “knew” that I was going to be “pooled” to
another floor that evening. (If staffing was low on any unit the administration
had the prerogative to reassign nurses to that shift to accommodate the
staffing need.) I , however, had never been pooled and I had no reason to
believe that I would be that night. But I knew. I also knew where I was to go
to: 3 West. I walked into my unit and sure enough the nurse in charge for dayturn
apologetically informed me that I was to report to 3 West for the evening
shift.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>She was a little perplexed by the
fact that I took it so well. (Nurses do not like to other floors which are
unfamiliar to them.) I had had plenty of time to mentally prepare. <o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>THE TORNADO<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>In 1985 I was working as
a head nurse in the Va Medical Center in Bay Pines, FLA, a government facility
in St. Petersburg, FLA. On the night prior to May 31<sup>st</sup>,1985 I went
to bed as usual. I had a dream about a tornado in my hometown . I must admit
that I have , occasionally, throughout my life had dreams about tornadoes.
Perhaps it was the damn Wizard of Oz scene that affected my psyche. Regardless,
I had never had one as vivid as the one that I had that night in my dream. I
omnisciently knew that a tornado was coming. I went to warn my parents but when
I went to their house they could not see me. In my dream I could see all that
was happening and felt helpless to do anything about it. My parents were on the
back deck which was just off of their two story bedroom. They were pointing to
the woods in our backyard and were hearing a tornado, or the typical “train”
coming. They seemed very frightened and I kept trying to tell them to get to
the cellar but , again, my attempts were futile, as they could not hear
me.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Finally, as the “train” got closer
they went to the cellar . I woke from my dream shaken. I was in a cold sweat .
I thought that perhaps I was just homesick, as I was 1200 miles from them and
that fact had contributed to this very troubling dream. I went to work on the
31<sup>st</sup> and at lunch I sat with an acquaintance (whose name I have
since forgotten) , a man who worked in the social service section and who was a
psychologist. As we had lunch together I felt very compelled to share my dream
with him. He was very supportive and I recall feeling better having gotten it
off of my chest. That evening I was watching TV in my townhouse with my
roommates Sheri and Jeffrey. The news flash was terrifying: several tornadoes
had ravaged the northeast, particularly some towns in Ohio and Pennsylvania.
Specifically Niles , Ohio and Wheatland and Hermitage PA had been hit the
hardest along with several other remote towns. The casualties were mounting and
no more specifics were coming out of the area as communications were down. My
entire family and friends lived in Hermitage and the surrounding areas. I tried
in vain to call and call. I was about to go out to the Tampa airport and buy a
ticket home when I finally reached my mom late that evening. She was extremely
shaken. The massive tornado had touched ground literally a few blocks away. In
fact its path had been directly behind them west of the woods in my dream and
cut a swath to the south of them. I believe that they did not know what was
hitting them at the time but I believe that they did go to the cellar. The
first indication that they knew that something really bad had happened was when
they described hearing hundreds of ambulance sirens all around them. There were
at least 38 deaths in their immediate area. The tornado had occurred hours
after my dream at 5pm on the 31<sup>st</sup>.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>That had been a Friday. All whom I loved were safe so I staying in
Florida. On Monday I saw the man with whom I had had lunch with on Friday and
he immediately asked if any of those tornadoes were close to my hometown. He
was incredulous when I told him just how close they had come.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>THE REGATTA TRAGEDY<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I was living in
Pittsburgh,PA<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>having moved from Florida
a couple of years before. When my roommate and I got to Pittsburgh we discovered
a yearly event which was the Regatta. It consisted of several events over a few
days in August, culminating in a high speed boat race on the last day of the
Regatta.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(I believe that we had seen the
previous two year’s races in 1986 and 1987.) I believe that it was 1988 that we
were positioned on the bank of the Allegheny River with some other friends for
the final race. I remember saying to everybody as the boats sped around the
course that it made me nervous that the boats were so close; it was a wonder
that no accident had ever happened. Not two minutes past that statement we
became aware that that the boat race had suddenly stopped and there was a lot
of commotion at the area to the left of us. A boat had lost control and had
exited the water only to land in the Regatta audience not 80 yards away from
where we sat. We went to see what had happened but we couldn’t get close.
Ambulances came and went and the Regatta was cancelled. It turned out that
several people had been critically injured as the boat had literally ripped
through the audience. Sadly a boy had been critically injured as well. This was
naturally disturbing to all of us and we went home as there was nothing else we
felt like doing. About a week later I awoke and had had a dream. I called to my
roommate Sheri and told her that in my dream I had had a vision of a newspaper
headline and it had read “BOY 7, DIES FROM REGATTA INJURIES”. She became
visibly shaken. She had just gone outside a little earlier and to get the paper
and there on the front page was the headline exactly as I had seen it in my
dream (even the comma was there). How could I have possibly seen that exact
headline in my dream?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This I swear to be
true. <o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>PEDESTRIAN ACCIDENT<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I was on my way to work
at the VA Hospital in Pittsburgh,PA in the late 80’s. The exact year is unclear
to me; I would guess 89. I worked dayturn in the VA in the capacity of a
vascular clinical nurse and was associated with the vascular lab nurses because
I remember calling them , quite upset by what had happened that morning. I was
driving down Route 88 towards work when I came upon an accident. It had
apparently occurred just moments before I had arrived, as there were no people
gathered and certainly no emergency vehicles. In fact, my car was the “first
responder” so to speak as it was the first to encounter the accident. There was
a large commercial truck stopped in the road with writing on it denoting a
plumbing company. To my horror I realized that under the truck was a woman
pedestrian who was pinned under the vehicle. I quickly got out of my car and
immediately went under the truck to the aid of the woman. She was conscious and
obviously in shock. She seemed to be partially crushed by the underworkings of
the truck but she was still alert. I heard people around me indicating that
emergency personnel had been summoned. She was very frightened and all I could
think to do, being a nurse, was to maintain a patent airway and to reassure
her. That is what I did. I did not leave her until the emergency personnel
arrived and I was quickly dismissed and frankly quite relieved. I got into my
car and had a strong knowledge come to me that her name was Mary and that she
was 51. She had not been able to talk while she was under the truck so she
could not have told me her name and age. I called work and told them about my
experience, including the fact that I “knew” her name and age. The next day in
the paper, sure enough, there was an entry that a pedestrian had been
critically injuring on Route 88. The pedestrian was identified as Mary (last
name forgotten), age 51. To this day I do not know if she survived but I know I
will never forget her. <o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Since the late 80’s I
have really had no memorable experiences other than normal ones such as
marrying in 1994 and having two very special children in 1994 and 1997. I spent
14 years at the same address in Bethel Park, PA and as much as I would have
welcomed a “sign” from my long deceased grandmother, nothing came. Nor did I
have any more psychic experiences (although the girls at work still ask me to
pick their horses, to no avail!) In August of 2001 our family of four moved to
a larger home about ½ mile away from my previous address. This current home is
a lovely Craftsman style ranch with a twist of Frank Lloyd Wright in the design
especially with regard to the corner style windows. It was custom built in 1950
by one of two brothers who raised his family there. The second of the two
brothers had also built a home on the homestead property about 200 yards from ours.
After the original owner (husband) died on a golf course, the home was sold to
a young family of four who lived there for about 10 years. They in turn sold it
to me as they had been offered a job promotion in Harrisburg. <o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>From August of 2001 to
the beginning of 2002 I did not notice anything unusual. In late January of
2002 I was wiping down the hardwood hall floor which is a dead end to three
bedrooms. I started at the bedrooms and in my typical fashion scrubbed the
floor on my hands and knees (husband calls my strong Hunkie woman!), backing up
towards the floor in my living room. I had finished the hall and was about to
start the rest of the hardwood when I noticed footprints on the hall floor.
They were very distinct and heading in the direction of the bedrooms, in other
words, away from me. I called for my husband to come and look and he agreed
that they were footprints but attributed them to my son. I had never left the
hall and certainly would have noticed my son walking in front of me as I was scrubbing
a floor!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Besides he was not in any of
the bedrooms, nor was anyone else. I found this to be very curious and a few
days later I wet down the hallway floor again to try to reproduce the prints,
thinking that perhaps someone in the past had walked on a waxed floor. I could
not reproduce the prints. <o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>One day within a couple
of weeks of the “prints” I was sitting on the commode in the bathroom (where
else would a commode be?) . The light was on and suddenly the light turned off.
It was daytime but it was dreary out. There is a small hallway that precedes
the bathroom so it wasn’t a child prank. I would have seen them flicking the
switch on the wall. The light switch was down in the Off position. The switch
was not loose; you have to push it down in order to turn the light off. Nor
were the bulbs burnt out. The light switch was able to be turned on and off as
usual.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I had hired a babysitter
Sheila who had come to our home that school year and she spent the days there
with my then 4 year old daughter Samantha and her own infant son Christian. She
was a lovely girl about 23 years old and was very reliable and mature. My
daughter loved having them here. In March of 2002 I came home from work and
Sheila proceeded to relay and experience that they had had that day. Sheila had
heard some commotion in my bedroom and went in to investigate. Some items on my
highboy had been disturbed : my grandmother’s picture and some knickknacks. She
assumed that the cat had done it, although the cat was not in sight. She stated
that she was busy tidying the dresser and had both children in the room with
her. She described an intense feeling of someone else in the room with her and
she felt that she were being watched. This was a very unusual sensation for
her, one that she had never experienced. At this point she told me that she had
never believed in ghosts. She grabbed her baby and my daughter and led them
down the hall. As they were walking toward the living room the TV suddenly
turned on of its own volition. The remote was secure. Sheila was very
frightened and my daughter can validate this story to this day. Incidentally I
had never told Sheila of either of the prior events. It was at this point that
I realized that there may be an entity in my house. Because the picture frame
was that of my grandmother I speculated that it may be her. But why here and
why now?<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>During the summer of
2002 I remember that my son would notice that the electric burners were on on
the stovetop but noone had turned them on. It was erratic. One day it would be
the left back burner; another day it would be the right front burner. I did not
make much of this except that I was concerned about a fire. I did call a
maintenance person who “fixed” the left back burner and there have been no
incidents since. <o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>The fall of 2002 was
uneventful as much as I could see. However in December of 2002 something
happened that seemed more divine that ghostly. My children had played for years
with large alphabet mat letters that measured 12x12 inches and had the letters
such that they could be punched out. They were interlocking pieces that could
make a floor mat. Over the years we lost pieces and the children had tired of
playing with them. I recall throwing several of the pieces away just to debride
the pile of toys that they had. Only a few of the random letters remained and I
was unaware what those letters were. On December 10 of that year my mother went
into the hospital with recurrence of seizure activity that she had had during a
hospitalization in September of that year. On December 11, a Wednesday, I
received a call from my sister that our mother had gotten dramatically worse
and was in the intensive care unit. I was to be at work that day so I planned
on calling off to go the<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>90 miles to the
hospital. Except the weather that morning was so treacherous with ice that the
roads were impassable. School had been cancelled and my babysitter could not
get to my house. I was stuck and felt as helpless as ever. I called my sister
back and told her about the weather. When I hung up the phone I was feeling
frantic. I remember walking into the gameroom in the basement just then and
there on the floor was the word HOPE spelled out vertically on the gameroom
carpet by four of those alphabet letters. I was stunned and just stood there
looking at them , trying to understand how they could be there. I called the
children to the basement to ask them if they had been playing with the letters
and they said that they don’t play with them at all anymore. I am pretty tidy
about the house and so I know that they weren’t laying there the previous
evening. I could only believe that the word was for me, for me to calm down and
keep up my hope that my mom would be OK. I did start to feel a sense of calm
and began to pray. She did go on to suffer a stroke two days later but has
recovered well since. I did take a picture of the letters to document this
incredible occurrence. <o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>The year 2002 ended and
for the better part of 2003 I did not notice anything unusual. In September of
2003 my mother-in-law took a fall which eventually led to her demise. Shortly
after she was hospitalized she unexpectedly had a severe stroke. My husband
received a call from his sister that night and the outlook was grim. It would
only be a matter of days before his mother’s death. We went to be as usual and
in the morning my husband woke me up and asked me, “Why did you do that with my
keys?” I had no idea what he was talking about. Dan is a creature of habit; he
rarely deviates from his routine. He had placed his keys in a bowl in his
drawer in the basement as he always does. His keys are on a sturdy solid chrome
ring and consist of a car key, a house key and a work key. When he had gone to
the basement to get his keys to go to work he found that they had all been
taken off the ring and lined up in the drawer. We drilled and drilled the
children (again) who looked pretty perplexed that we were asking them about
Dad’s keys. I do not believe that the children were ever in that drawer. I keep
pretty close tabs on them and if they were in the drawer I would have known it.

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I was cooking some
lasagna one day in late September. I still have the same oven that was
mentioned previously. The interior oven light has not worked for as long as I
can remember. It may have been burnt out; I simply did not check it. Too busy.
Anyway I was checking the progress of the lasagna and I thought to myself, “Boy
I wish I had a real oven with a light in it.” I turned my back and when I faced
the oven again the oven light was on. I was able to turn it on and off at will,
as if it had never been broken or burnt out. The next time I went to use the
oven light, it would not work. Who didn’t know that?<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

October my husband was out early doing his weekly grocery shopping. I had just
gotten up and both of the children were in bed sleeping. I was busy tidying the
house and looked at the clock, realizing that I should get the children up soon
so that they could get ready for Sunday school. I went into the bathroom and
began to get my toothbrush ready when I heard footsteps of someone walking down
the hall towards the living room. My first thought was, “Good, at least one of
them (the children) is up.” Immediately I followed the footsteps into the
living room, dining room and noone was in sight. I looked into the bedrooms and
the children were still sleeping soundly. Desperate to explain it I rushed to
the window to see if Dan’s truck were back in the driveway and that somehow he had
gotten past me to walk down the hall. Dan was still at Shop and Save.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

became very cold. I had bought a good winter coat for Joey the previous year
and it was navy with bright orange trim. I bought it at Kids R US for 60$. We
started looking for his coat one day and it was nowhere to be found. We looked
in all the obvious places: his closet, downstairs closet, drawers, floor of
closet, etc. I personally went through his (small) closet at least four time
trying to find the damn thing. I was very frustrated because 1) he had lost a
practically brand new coat and 2) he need coat to wear! He looked at his lost
and found at school. We checked the daycare lost and found. It was not to be
found. Then one day early December on a Saturday we had our first big snow. I
think it was December 13. Joey came out to me in the kitchen with a very odd
look on his face. He almost looked scared. He said, “Come here, that coat is in
my closet.” There in his room in the front part of the closet that we see and
use every day was his winter coat. With the bright orange trim that noone could
have missed that many times searching the closet. The obvious thought occurred
to me that Joey had found it and placed it in his closet. But after talking at
length to him I do not believe that to be the case. It just reappeared. Just in
time for the big snow.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>One weekend in November
there were two unusual events. The first one occurred on a late Saturday
afternoon. I was out in the garage contemplating dusting off the exercise
machine called the Nordic Track. I had not used it in years. I pulled it into
the middle of the garage and tested the skis of the track and they were still
working fine. (Damn). However I realized that the device on the bar of the
machine that always documented the time of torture and distance skied was not
working. I took off the plastic lid of the device and set it on one of the ski
tracks. Just then my daughter entered the garage and asked what I was doing.
She never touched the machine. I told her that I need to find batteries for it
and took her by the hand to go upstairs for batteries. Joey and Dan were
upstairs at the time. We easily found two batteries and set off to go back to
the garage. When we got there the device was not on the track. In fact it was
nowhere to be seen. The garage door was closed and noone else had access to the
garage. This frustrated me to no end.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I
asked Samantha if she remembered me putting it on the track and she said that
she did. I traced my steps upstairs,thinking that I was losing my mind, and
maybe I did take it upstairs with me. No, I had not. I expressed my complete
frustration to my husband who followed me down to the garage. He stood there
looking at me as if I had lost it. Seconds later he was walking around the
garage and reached into a bin full of baseballs and there it was. He asked me
it that was what I was looking for. The bin was at least 10 feet away from the
Nordic Track. He was as amazed as I was. There was the device that had
apparently moved itself 10 feet into a bin of balls. This was November 22.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>The next day November 23
another strange thing occurred. The children were outside riding their bikes
and I was in Joey’s room running the sweeper. It is a rather small but cozy
room and has a sizable TV. Dan had come to Joey’s doorway to ask me a question.
One of our pet peeves with the children is discovering that one of their TVs is
on when they have gone off to do something else. At the point when Dan came to
the doorway there was no TV on or we both would have gone ballistic about it.
He left and joined the children in the driveway. I finished running the sweeper
and went to the kitchen to get a glass of water. I then heard loud voices
coming from the bedroom area. I quickly went down the hall to find Joey’s TV on
full blast. They were all out in the driveway where they had been. That TV had
not been on . And then it was.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>December of 2003 was a
really active month. It seemed like the incidents were escalating as the time
intervals were becoming shorter and shorter. During the week of December 8<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>( I had become acutely aware of dates and
started documenting them) I was in Joey’s bed reading and trying to get him to
go to sleep. He is 9 but still needs an occasional backrub to get to sleep. Dan
and Samantha were sound asleep and had been for about an hour. Joey and I both
heard what would best be described as a loud “boom” in the house. Almost like
the furnace ducts expanding or contracting (like someone pounded on one of the
ducts). We had been in the house for 2 ½ years and I can honestly say that I
have never heard that sound. I checked the house and found no source of the
sound. It was around 10pm at night. The very next night I was in bed with Joey
again at around the same time and Joey said, “ I hope we don’t hear that sound
again.” Not two minutes later we did. Again I checked the house, outside the
house and assured Joey that there was no danger. We have yet to ever hear that
sound again at this house. <o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>On December 12 I was
home alone as I had called off sick with cold symptoms. Later that afternoon I
became compulsive and guilty, (as working mothers do) and decided that I
shouldn’t waste the time off; there is so much to be done around the house. I
proceeded to straighten up both Joey and Samantha’s rooms. I had been in Sam’s
room for almost an hour sorting papers, throwing nonsense away, folding
comforters, and making sense of the menagerie of stuffed animals. I felt
satisfied that her room looked tidy and went to Joey’s room. All that his room
needed was a little pickup and the sweeper. Their rooms are within a feet of
each other. I finished the sweeper in Joe’s room and for some reason I had one
more thought of something to do in Sam’s room. I quickly passed into Sam’s room
and as I passed through the doorway I was struck by a profound coldness, almost
as if I had entered a walkin freezer. The most sensual memory I have of that
split second was feeling like there was condensation on my face as I went into
her room. I stopped dead in my steps and didn’t move. I turned around as if to
expect that I would see something. I was stunned by the experience. The furnace
was actually on as you might expect in December and I could feel the contrast
of the heat coming from the duct and the coldness around me. I stepped back and
forth through the doorway to validate the coldness but it was gone. That was
the first time I felt fear. <o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>On December 13 the
aforementioned coat appeared in his closet. <o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>During the following
work/school week of 12/16 the children and I were preparing to leave to get
them on the school bus. We walked into the kitchen and Joey said, “There is the
stove light on again.” Sure enough, the stove light that seems to have a mind
of its own was on. He asked me if I was going to be afraid to come back after
the bus stop. I said that I wasn’t scared of that silly stove light and
proceeded to take them to the stop. I had turned off the stove light before I
left. When I came back it was still off but there was a hell of a commotion
going on in the living room. My cat,<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>(who, by the way, really never seems to react at anything at all) was in
the living room on the Persian rug and he was carrying on like I had never seen
him. He was howling and crying as if in pain. He did not seem to notice me and
he seemed to be following something in the room with his head and eyes. He was
very distraught and I have never seen him like that. Then he just stopped . It
was over but the worst of it was the howling and crying that I can still hear.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>The most convincing
event of all for me and my son occurred on 12/18. I had fallen asleep with my
daughter Samantha and was awakened by a trepidatious Joey who said that he had
heard footsteps in the hallway. I got out of Sam’s bed and went into Joey’s
room to offer support. He said that he had heard footsteps in the hallway
adjacent to his room and then again in the living room. I tried to calm him and
reinforced the fact that he was safe and no harm would come to him. I laid down
beside him in the dark and we both heard footsteps in the hall. I jumped up to
investigate the house. No one. Nothing.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>The cat had been at our feet so he was not the culprit. We laid down
again and again heard footsteps only this time they seemed to be more localized
to the livingroom/dining<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>room area.
Again I investigated and found nothing. Joey stated that that was what had
scared him to wake me up in the first place. We were both nervous but again
tried to go to sleep in Joey’s bed. It was then that we heard distinctive LOUD
knocking on the wall just adjacent to Joey’s bed and coming from the hall.
There were six knocks and could not be mistaken for anything but what they
were. We were very frightened by this experience. In the morning I asked Joey
to reiterate the details of what we had heard without any coaching from myself.
He relayed the story just as I had recalled it without any error to detail.
That night has been a turning point. Joey and I both know that there is
something here and we try our best to cope with that. We are both a little
nervous at night but we do believe that the entity is not here to harm us. We
just wish that the entity would not scare us at night anymore. <o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Christmas and New Year’s
passed without event. (Gratefully).I recall feeling somewhat secure and
attributed it to my foolish request alone in my living room the day after the
knocking. I asked that whomever was responsible to please stop frightening my
child. (And me). I almost thought that it was gone. And then one Sunday night
January 18<sup>th</sup> 2004 my son and I were alone on the couch watching TV.
Dan was in bed sleeping and Samantha had gone with a friend to the movies. It
was about 9:30pm. We expected Sam home at any minute. We were pretty comfy,
wrapped in blankets and enjoying a story about Noah’s Ark. All of a sudden Joey
looked at me and stated that he was really scared and nervous. He said that
“something is wrong” and he sprang from the couch. I panicked a little, as
Samantha was not home yet and I feared that he was premonicient. I asked him if
he was nervous about Samantha being out and he said no, it was not about
Samantha. He continued to pace in front of me with a worried, severe look on
his face., marking his forehead with concern. He seemed for a while to be
inconsolable. I asked him to sit back down on the couch with me and he refused,
stating “No, that is where I started feeling this.” He went into the dining
room and seemed to calm a bit. As soon as he came back in front of the couch he
continued to have that same unnerving worry on his face. This went on for at
least 10 minutes and again I felt helpless to help him. I felt nothing
extraordinary and continued to try to calm him. At last the feeling went away
for him and thankfully, Samantha arrived shortly thereafter. Joey felt
something that I did not. I am convinced that he and I are more receptive to
the “energy” that is here, as Dan and Samantha never report anything
independently. But of all the experiences, the above one was the most
frustrating because I felt so helpless to help my child. Incidentally, since
that event, Joey avoids the couch.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>(Note: there is a history to the couch that is interesting: belonged to
the brother of the original owner of my house. He had died and I had ironically
bought it at the estate sale months before I purchased his brother’s house!)<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>On January 30<sup>th</sup>
, against my husband’s wishes, I got yet another dog. This time a puppy 5
months old, a chocolate miniature poodle. Things were hectic here as I
desperately tried to housebreak a dog without my husband noticing any of the
accidents. I was in considerable better spirits , having found another doting
dog<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>like Wally who passed away in
November, so time went by without event. I remember (again) thinking that maybe
the ghost is being upstaged by the poodle, but so be it, things were going well.
I did not notice anything unusual to speak of. On the weekend before St.
Patrick’s day my son casually mentioned that his teacher had left a note in his
bookbag regarding his inability to see the board from the back of the room. I
was not surprised, as it seems that Joey’s vision is on a path worse than mine
or his father’s. On that Sunday night I suggested that we will probably make an
appointment to go to his eye doctor again. Within the last year he went and
obtained a new prescription which we placed in his old frames and I also
purchased a rather pricey frame for his new prescription as well. He always
preferred the old frames so the new glasses were unused. I asked him that night
where his newer glasses were as it was obvious that I would just change the
prescription in those. He stated that he had not seen them in some time. I was
more than annoyed, recalling that the frames were well over 100$. He stated
that the last time he remembered wearing them was for the formal school nurse
eye test two months prior and that he had changed them as soon as he got home.
He denied having ever seen them again. That Sunday night a full search ensued.
I become somewhat maniacal when I can’t find something. I did a preliminary
search of his room and all the suspect areas in the house where you might
expect to find eyeglasses. No glasses. I instructed him to look in the lost and
found at school on Monday even though he was insistent that he wore them home
after the school eye exam. On Monday night I searched the room again to no
avail. My frustration was escalating as I was looking at yet another expense
for frames. On Tuesday morning I asked him where he would likely have put them
the day of the exam when he came home. He stated that he would have put them on
his dresser or on his trophy case. Tuesday morning I put both of the children
on the bus and obsessed with finding the glasses, decided to come back to the
house for one final search before I went to work. I tore his room apart and
specifically searched his dresser and trophy case. Incidentally, two weeks
prior, Joey had totally rearranged his trophy case as he had just won three
trophies at a tournament. I had little hope of finding them in the trophy case
because I had witnessed the dismantling of the case two weeks prior and I would
have noticed his glasses when I helped him put all of his trophies back. I gave
up , frustrated, and went to work and even relayed the story to my coworkers.
When I cam home that night Joey announced that they had good news: that they
had found the glasses. Apparently they came home from daycare with their dad
and when Joey and Dan walked into Joey’s room there the glasses were big as day
, on the second shelf of the trophy case, visible from the doorway. I
interrogated my husband, thinking that perhaps he had found them and placed
them there. He denied it and seemed as mystified as myself as to how they had
gotten there. Then I did my best light bulb interrogation of Joey, thinking
that perhaps he had found them in an irresponsible location and he too could
have placed them there. He was very defensive and stated that he absolutely had
not and that when he saw the glasses there, where we had looked so many
previous times that he was “creeped out”. He made reference to the coat incident,
stating “Mom, the coat appeared out of nowhere too. I thought the ghost was
gone but maybe it is trying to protect me cause Dad was really mad about the
glasses.” Of note, the glass lenses appeared quite damaged with significant
scratches over them. Joey denies having ever seen them in that condition. I
believe him because he trusts me and knows that I will protect him as long as
he tells the truth. The glasses seemingly appeared from the “other side” and I
for one am grateful.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

have felt the house that I live in may have &quot;others&quot; that inhabit my
space. I am not afraid of the activities that go on for i don't feel it is one
that wants to hurt us I feel it is there to watch over us but it is just uneasy
at times to &quot;know&quot; things happen and I am not ashamed to tell people
of the activities that go around here. My daughter who is 19 has also
experienced the &quot;others&quot; , we have shut doors and then to hear them
open again with in just a few minutes of closing them. I burn alot of candles
and one day I was getting ready to go to work, I finished my shower and came
from my bedroom only to have all five candles blown out.. these candles were
all spaced around the living area<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>and in
the kitchen so I have dismissed the possibility of a draft going through the
house. When I am here alone I can feel a presence and also my daughter has felt
this as well. I will tell you of this story and not take up any more of your
time, I often visit the cemetary to visit my mother ,father ,brother , grand
parents ,uncles and aunts I usually take my daughter but only once before have
I taken my 2 yr old son and he was just a baby then not even a yr old. I pulled
through the gate of the cemetary on this particular day and my son starts
saying nanny papa see over there and pointed to the direction as to where they
are buried... my parents died before my son was born. He does not know them and
has not even seen a picture of them I had a house fire, not this house, but all
the pictures were lost in that fire. <o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>When I was about 5 years
old, my Uncle was living in a house on Brineger Road in Soldier, Kentucky which
is just a couple of miles out of Olive Hill (on a side note, the house has been
through I think 4 owners in the past 13 years or so, no one stays there for
very long.)<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This house had a history
that went with it that I did not find out about until my 7th grade year of school
when we did our local history studies.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Even when I was young, I got very odd feelings in this house, like I was
being constantly watched, ESPECIALLY when I was in the basement.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Everytime I would turn around and try to see
what was looking at me, I would catch a glimpse of someone running out of my
line of sight, from what I could tell, it was a young boy.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>This, as well as hearing odd noises during
the nights and the midget closets in the houe assured that I didn't spend much
more time there than was necessary.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Fast
forward to 7th grade now, and what our teacher tells us about this house:<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>A young boy named Roy

in the basement and he was abused very badly by his parents, so badly that they
beat him to<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>     </span><o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>death and left his body
to rot under his bed in the basement.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>After a couple of weeks the smell became untolerable, so, the parents
hung the body from a tree in the <o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>woods and reported the
child missing,<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>there was a search party
for Roy Ricky, and every night the parents would move the corpse to a section
of the woods that <o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>had already been
searched.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Finally hanging it in the
mouth of a mine where the body was found and the parents were prosecuted for it

this information is historically accurate, I have been unable to find much
information on it, but the other local history things we studied were accurate,
and I have found documentation on them.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

time and was spending some time at this house once again, needless to say, I
wasn't thrilled.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The feeling of being
watched was still there, as well as the glimpses of the young boy when I turned
around.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The feeling in the basement was
much more menacing now, menacing to the point that I actually refused to go
down there anymore, and normally these feelings don't bother me.<span

occurences at this house.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I was not

members that were raised in this house, and I will try to include a few of
them, but first, let me try to describe the house.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>It's a large victorian
house with a tin roof and old wood burning firnace with a large brick chimney,
a porch out front and a yard full of trees,<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>inside this house, there is a large basement and a large upstairs, those
are the 2 areas of the house I get the most feelings in.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In the basement I only get feeling of good
spirits, one that I believe is my grandfather, he was always putting wood in
the stove, or cracking walnuts, or fixing something in the basement, and I
really believe this spirit is his, however, the upstairs of the house is a
different story.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I don't think there are
any evil spirits on the upper level of the house, but I believe there are some
angry spirits that reside there.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>One
room in particular gives off some funny feelings.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It is the room at the left end of the house
upstairs, and it has a closet attached to it that spans the length of the
house, we'll call it the long closet.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>This closet has many many many items that belonged to people who have
since died.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My great grandmother's
clothing is in this closet, as well as an 8 year old child's clothing, this
child was hit by a car, and I believe that this could be one of the angry
spirits, trying to cope with the passing of the body, I know I'd be upset if my
life was ended that early.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Also there
are clother pictures, and various other articles that belong to someone who got
shot on a hunting trip.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I have never really seen
anything in this house, other than flickers of movement occassionally, but I
have heard many things.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Not limited to
breathing coming from the upstairs, bed springs creaking upstairs, and the
sound of the furnace having wood packed into it in the basement.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I don't place a lot of stock into what I see
and hear anyways, I place most stock into the feelings I get.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>This house was home to
at one point, 8 kids, my grandfather and grandmother, and my grandfather's
mother.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Plus, innumerable other children
that would stay with them.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It was not
uncommon to have 15 people in the house at any given time.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>That I believe is why there are so many
accounts of people hearing things in the house.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>My mother and grandmother
have both told me about heaqring deep breathing coming from upstairs.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>My Aunt once heard a
sewing machine running upstairs, and she was the only one in the house, it was
a foot operated sewing machine, not electric.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Even my grandfather has
heard what my family calls knocking spirits, which I should probably go into
this a bit more, because it could explain a lot.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Supposedly my family was cursed by a witch
over a land dispute.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My grandfather and
every single one of his children has been victim to these knocking spirits,
including my mother.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I myself have heard
knocking in the walls before, but I'm really not frightened by them.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>I guess I could just be
crazy, but it really doesn't feel like it to me, I get these feelings in a lot
of places, only to find out later that people have seen ghosts in that same
place. None have ever tried to communicate with me.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The Governor hotel is now a senior/special
needs residential apartment house in Harrisburg Pa. Back in 1987, the 6 story
building was abandoned and had been for many years. The building was
structurally sound, with no roof leaks, so it was in great shape when I started
work there.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>A little background on the building. The
building is built like a U, the front and left side exposed to the light (a
corner property), the right side, a 10 story building was built flush with the
wall, effectively sealing the windows on that side from light. The center
courtyard of the building had fire escapes, both sides roof to pavement, with
entrances on each floor at the rear of each hallway at the back of the
building. The windows were sealed shut with sheet metal all the way up in this
area to keep vandals out, thus sealing out all light in the right side of the
building and all the rooms on the top 5 floors, right side. The first floor was
set up as a lobby/storefront in front with white marble steps leading up to the
front desk and down to the basement. Following back you went through to the old
kitchen, then the old bar, then to the old walk in fridges.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The basement, in the front was an old work out
area with floor to ceiling mirrors that ran the length of both facing walls.
Progressing rear you go through storage rooms, the boiler room, the old beer
storage room and I found under the left side main stairwell an old maintenance
storeroom sealed with drywall and holding the records for the building. These
are in the city archives I was told a while back.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The second thru sixth floors are built in a U
shape, with rooms on both sides of the corridors. There were 5 rooms in the
front, with the corner room, street side, having a curved glass cupola in the
corner, very classy, all 5 floors.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>the side corridors had 6 rooms per side both
sides of the hall. the left side was in the light since the outside windows
facing the street were not covered, but the right side were pitch black and
hadn't seen sunlight for 10 yrs. Those 5 hallways gave me fits the 2 mths. I
worked there.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The building was built at the turn of the
century, and had last been used as the YWCA. when the new Y was opened,
everything was abandoned in the bldg., beds. linens, dressers, clothes,
paperwork, journals,....and diarys.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>Some of the beds were made, some dissheveled,
some strewn about, and for a young guy with a explorer spirit, a goldmine of
stuff to explore. At first..<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>My job in the building was to expose the beams
in the buildings 2nd. thru 6th. floors. That required me to cut through 1 1/2
inches of horsehair plaster, reinforced with steel mesh in a 2 foot by 2 foot
square area in four or five areas in each room, in the ceiling, on a ladder,
with a 8 in. hand held elec. grinder. Coupled with this is that I started the
job in January when it was 15 degrees outside.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The building had NO electric in it, so
everything had to be run off of a generator we put in the main stairwell and
moved up the stairs as I progressed up the floors. No heat. No light, lots of
extension cords. I did most of the basement exploring with a flashlight, by
myself because I couldn't get anyone else from the crew to work in the building
for more than 2 days, because they got creeped out whenever they worked with
me. When I had to cut the holes,<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>the grinder made so much
dust in the room You couldn't see your hand in front of your face, even in the
sun lit rooms. I was on the ladder cutting and the guys were to hold the
ladder. Once the dust started flying (we wore dust respirators and goggles) the
guys would say they saw people watching us from the doorways, beds or wherever
In some rooms. I would joke that it was 'my buddy the ghost' to freak them out,
not knowing that they were serious. This usually happened on the dark side
because the generator powered the clip light and the grinder and when I turned
on the grinder the light dimmed to almost nothing till I was done cutting.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>I have always, for some reason, been the
focus of 'phenomona' since I was a kid. If a spirit was around, it would let me
know, usually scaring the crap out of me, until a psychic lady my mom knew told
me what was going on.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>After that I didn't pay that much attention to
that stuff as much. But the other guys that worked with me couldn't handle it
and would quit rather than go back in the building. So I spent a lot of time in
the building by myself Grinding holes ad reading the letters and journals left
behind.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>My boss hired a guy to work with me That was,
as I am, a former Marine, mainly because he scared the crap out of my boss
during the interview, and he percieved him to be tough and grounded enough to
work in the bldg. with me and not be 'scared by Bills' ghost stories'.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We worked together for two weeks, 1 week
before I was done. <o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>This is why. We had to move the furniture<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>to cut, and about 3 days into his employ, we
moved a bed and found a diary. I read the diary of a lady that was put thru
Hell and continued to put herself through Hell almost on a daily basis. The
final page stated that she was going to commit suicide. Whether she did or not
I don't know.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'><span

on I felt watched every moment I was there. My mom called that night and her
psychic friend had told her to tell me not to take anything home from 'your
job', that I didn't want anything following me home&quot; I wanted to take that
diary home so bad. I'm glad I left it there where I found it. We always chained
the doors from the inside so burgulars, and the boss couldn't come in on us. We
were halfway down the right 5th floor hall cutting a hole when ken tapped me on
the leg and said , I thought,<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>&quot;There is someone on the bed&quot;! I stopped and looked after the
dust cleared, standing on the ladder, to the point we could see, and on the bed
was a clean area on the sheet shaped like a butt where someone had to be
sitting . We both got shook up on that one.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>His final straw came at the last room when we
were cutting the last hole. Dust was flying , the noise was deafening and all
of a sudden the generator that we had just filled and oiled, stopped, dousing
the light and the grinder, and we both heard someone walking down the hall with
a heavy tread with keys rattling with his every step. He said burgular, lets
get him!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>We ran out in the hall in the
dark , looked to the left toward the direction of the footsteps, also the
direction of the lighted end of the bldg. and ....No one there. He screamed
&quot;check the stairwells'. I went to the right Into the dark to check the
fire escape entrance and the dark back stairwells, and he went to the main
stairwell and neither of us found anyone. We went down to the first floor and
all the chains were intact. He Was DONE! He had me open the door, , The boss
was pulling up with the foreman, and as he got out of the truck, Ken started
screaming and cussing out the boss about all the stuff he saw and that he was
never ever going back in there and that he would be over to get his check. Then
he started running and I never saw him again. I ended up finishing the job
myself, and my boss never set foot in the building after that.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>Hi my name is Sarah I
live in a small but, popular town called Fort Myers in the sunshine state of
Florida. I never really believed in ghost or spirits up in tell about two years
ago. I was living with my mother and two siblings in a small but, very old
florida style home. It was all built out of wood hidden in trees and was creepy
at just the looks of it. We had only lived there about a month when my great
grandfather had become ill with cancer. All of the family decided to come
togther at the hospital while he spoke his last words and drew his final breath.
He wanted us to know it was okay to let go. WELL that following night for some
reason my mother , brother, sister and I decided to sleep in the living room
together ,mostly because we were so upset. My sister , brother , and myself had
fallen asleep but, my mother just couldn't seem to sleep. Just a few minutes
after we had zoncked out mom said she heard some one walking around. We had a
front room you had to go through to enter the door that led to the main part of
our house. She knew for a fact she had locked that door though. So she laid
there a little longer and the handle began to slowly turn and open the door. My
mom wondering how to defend us three kids and her self began to worry, as she
stood up to await the intruder we all woke up. My mom went up to the door
bravely and no one was there so she walked to the front room and the door was
still locked and pad locked. shocked the next morning we thought about it and
figured it was my great grandpa coming to visit and watch over us.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

at my Grandpa's house getting ready in the bath room for school. I saw a woman
walk down the hall towards the living room. I just thought it was my Grandma so
I just brushed it off. Then a few moments later i was looking out the door into
the hallway and I saw her again. I didnt recognize her. I ran into the living
room screaming at the top of my lungs, &quot;There's someone in the house,
Hurry&quot;. My grandpa took off into the house searching for an intruder. He
looked in every room, under the beds, and in the closets, he even looked in
cabinets big enough for someone to hide. There was no one there. Later that day
he said an old boarding house used to be on the same spot as the house was
built a long time ago. He said that I more than likely saw the woman who owned
it. He took out his picture box and showed me an old book that had the towns
history in it. He turned to the page where it had information on the boarding
house. As soon as i saw the picture of the owner I was speechless. I took me a
while but after i caught my breath i told my grandpa,&quot;Og my God, thats her<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>hello my name is
valerie, and this happen maybe 10 or 12 years ago,but it is still fresh in my
mind even today.i had to have surgery. and my husband was a shrimper at the
time and had to stay away for days,Well he did not want for me to be alone
because our daughter was only about 1 or 2 at the time.So my sister that is
younger then me, which i am the oldest, Ask me to come and stay with her. she
lived in a 3 bedroom house, oh the name of the place in which we lived is
called Port St.Joe Florida,In Gulf County.well,anyway, after i came out the
hospital, my husband dropped me off at my sister's house he had to get back on
the boat.I guess i stayed there for bout 3days and i came down with a
fever.well she had put me in the very back bedroom,my daughter, and my sister's
daughter slept on pallets on the floor next to my bed.ijn case i needed
anything during the night.Well this perticular night it was bout 2:00am and i
felt someone touch my forehead like a mother would touch a child to see if they
had a fever, then at the end of the bed i felt like the sofetest touch on my
legs, then the blanket i had on me was pulled up.then i felt them touch my
forehead again, well, at the time i didnt think much about it.the next morning
i ask my sister why didnt she say anything to me when she came into my room
last night....well she said i never came into your room...well that scared me
so much i called my mother for her to come and get me.My sister finally told me
that she and her husband have had alot of experiences with that house,she also
told me the room i was in is where a gentleman had hung hisself.she finally had
to move but to say the least i never went to her house again.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:white'>It seems that this place
is only active when Christmas time comes around. In a very small town called
Whitewright Texas there is a very old house that now belongs to my uncle. The
structure of the house is very stable as a matter of fact it has been lived in
alot longer than usual but is now used as storage by various family members of
mine. The first experience was when I was 11 and two days before Christmas it
was late into the evening and instead my parents driving back home 27 miles my
grandparents offered their old house for us to stay the night in. It had been
raining a little and it didn't take long for the three bedroom house to warm up
so we went to bed. I had two younger brothers, one of them was still a little
baby so he slept in the same room in a little crib that my grandmother had
still left put together for all of the grandchildren. I was quite tired and
almost fell asleep immediately when it started thundering and lightning. The
first loud crash woke me up and precisley the loud crash the outside screen
sounded as though someone had kicked the door. The house had a horseshoe shaped
porch and at each end of the porch was a door to the house another door was for
the living room. I screamed and my mother came in. I had woken up my baby
brother she had claimed but the thunder had woken him up. My mom picked up my
brother and took him with her to get him back to sleep. I tried to calm myself
to go to sleep and convinced myself that it was just a cat that got scared and
jumped up against the door. Many times though to convince myself I would check
outside through the window of the door. and then run back into the bed. I was
starting to drift off again when another thunder blast went off and lightning
followed but what I saw next terrified me even more so because I saw a figure
outside the window through the window curtain. I screamed out again and
scrambled off the bed to look into the next bedroom and tried to tell my mom
that someone was outside, she didn't believe and upon the suggestion of my
father I was escorted to the living room to sleep on the couch which made the
very front part of the porch even closer to me. All the windows were huge and
pretty much most of the living room was halfway nothing but windows but had
dark brown curtains. The storm subsided a little bit for another hour or so and
I tried with everything to stamp down the fear that wouldn't let go of me no
matter how I tried to shake it off. I forced myself to close my eyes. At that
moment someone or something stepped up onto the porch stomping and then started
walking. I stepped into my parents bedroom and asked my father if he heard the
walking on the porch he said it was the house settling. I know I was just a kid
but settling of the house didn't sound like a heavy man with big boots either.
I pleaded out of the window, I threatned, when I threatned it would stop for a
while but start up again. My last resort was praying to God for this to stop to
make whoever or whatever to go away. A few minutes later the rain drizzled and
the walking faded away. It didn't stop immediately just as though someone had
stepped off the porch but as though it was going away slowly. I fell asleep and
the morning came. I stepped out on the porch and the whole porch was covered in
mud clumps from one end of the porch to the other side. I talked with my aunt
and she told me that the only knowledge of the house was an old lady had lived
there and that some neighbors had found her dead in her bed and her dog was
missing. But that no one really cared about the dog anyhow. So the missing dog
wasn't much thought of after the lady's burial. The second activity was when I
had moved in with my aunt in the same house. She moved into the house a year
before I moved in with her and my cousins. My parents and I had very
considerable disagreements. Anyhow, as usual just a little before Christmas one
of my cousins and I were just about to go to sleep on the couch in the living
room which is the center of the house when my cousin rose up off the couch and
told me that someone was standing right beside and I got up off the couch and
made a mad dash to jump on the other side of the huge circular couch and jumped
right beside her. At that precise moment that I jumped up at the corner of my
eye I saw a very faint light move very fast in the center of the room not on
the wall or on the floor. Dishes were knocked over in the kitchen and my aunt
turned on all the lights. To explain this away so that we wouldn't be scared
and for all of us to get some sleep my aunt told us all that a cat and found
its way into the house and we scared it. The next morning my aunt went and
talked to my grandfather and a few weeks later they were digging in the back
yard and discovered a well and the remains of a dog. They filled the well with
rock and concrete. The activity stopped. Later it was told to me that the
Christmas before I moved in my aunt was alone at home in the same house and she
had been watching TV. Someone stepped up on the porch very heavily and tried to
break into the house by first turning the door knob and then trying to force
themselves through the door. She threatned whomever and they went away. The
house is now being used as the family storage house and whose evers friend of
the family storage as well. It is now not been lived in since my cousin Shane
last lived there.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

tell is one of a disturbing nature. It absolutely chokes me up every time I
tell it. If my grammar or language skills are not up to par, it's only because
I'm caught up in the horrid memories of that night.It was Newyears eve.My
cousin and I waited for our girlfriends to arrive, as we were having a party
that night.Yes there was alcohol, and say what you want, but I know what I saw.
The same thing we all saw. Anyway. Later that night we were all in my room,
drinking and singing,just having fun. It was a party. Time passed and more time
passed, and it began to get late. Something startled my cousins girlfriend. She
quickly eased her mind with the though that it was a household pet. A large dog
she thought. Little did she know we had no pets. When she later confronted me
about it, I told her just that. A little shaken, but mostly tired she and my
cousin went to lay down leaving my girlfriend and I alone in my room. We
watched TV for a while and just talked. We brought up how drunk my cousins
girlfriend must have been, and laughed. Well, it wasnt funny long. As we sat
there on the bed, half paying attention to the television, a &quot;thing&quot;
slothed across the floor in my room. We both sat stuck with fear holding
eachother as tight as we could. When it got to our feet it stopped, looked up
at us and almost smirked at our fear. We got a better look at it then. It was a
bloody, bludgeoned mess. It seemed to be walking on nubs of his knees and
elbows, and finnaly donned with a bashed in skull. It made my poor gilfriend
sick to her stomache. It continued its path to my closet and dissapeared. We
didn't sleep one second the whole night. If we hadn't all seen the god forsaken
creature I wouldn't have believed it my self. The next morning the black lights
were still on music was still going and bottles were every were. So I decided
to clean up. When I moved the speakers back to the other wall, the blacklight
shown down on the wall. Streams upon splashes upon steaks upon hand prints of
bright green trails were on my wall. It looked as if some one with green blood
was &quot;bludgeoned&quot; to death. Then I remember watching<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>forensic files and the luminol that they put
on surfaces to detect blood showed up green werever blood was. This really
choked me up. So finally I went and asked my stepdad if<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>he knew this houses history. His exact words
were, &quot; No. Why? Is the house HAUNTED?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>
