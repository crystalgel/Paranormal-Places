<td><b><font face="Arrus BT">These photos are examples of naturally occurring
events, processing errors or anomalous results that are often mistaken
for positive ghost photos.&nbsp;&nbsp; These photos are called false positives
by investigators.&nbsp; There are some similarities in these photos with
positive spirit photos but with time, experience and a careful eye you
can learn to tell them apart.&nbsp; I tried to pick a few good examples
of some of the most commonly made misidentified anomalies.&nbsp; If you
have any examples of false positive photos and you'd like to submit them,
you can <a href="mailto:ghosts@theshadowlands.net">send them to us here</a>

<b><font face="Arrus BT">These two photos are examples of what swarms of
bugs look like at a distance.&nbsp; These photos were taken intentionally
by Tome Wilson of <a href="http://www.sjgr.org">South Jersey Ghost Research</a>
to show the difference between spirit orbs and bugs.&nbsp; The film used
was Kodak Gold 35mm 800 speed.</font></b>

<b>The anomaly is what a flying bug looks like up close.&nbsp;&nbsp; Flies,
mosquitoes and other flying insects all look very similar to this anomaly
and it is often mistaken for a positive anomaly.&nbsp;&nbsp; This photo

<b>This is photo has two problems, one is the obvious flash reflecting
back in the mirror.&nbsp;&nbsp; The other problem is even though this picture
has a very faint orb in the hallway, it cannot be used as evidence because
the lens flare from the flash has made it worthless as evidence.&nbsp;&nbsp;
