<H3><A NAME="1"></A><B>Scientists Confident of Life on Jupiter Moon</B>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 4-10-97 </H3>

<P><B>PASADENA, Calif. (Reuter) - Space scientists said Wednesday they
were confident life existed in</B> <B>the muddy waters of one of Jupiter's
moons. </B></P>

<P><B>&quot;I am sure there's life there,&quot; John Delaney of the University
of Washington said in a reference to the</B> </P>

<P><B>Jovian moon <A HREF="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/galileo/europa/">Europa</A>.
Delaney and the other experts spoke at a news briefing detailing results
of</B> <B>pictures from the Galileo probe. </B></P>

<P><B>Pictures of Europa sent back by Galileo after its closest flyby of
the moon in February and released</B> <B>by the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration Wednesday showed a red-colored sea with</B> <B>a crust
of ice about three feet thick in which huge icebergs several miles across
were floating, the</B> <B>scientists said. </B></P>

<P><B>The images were taken as Galileo was 363 miles from Europa. Talking
to reporters at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the scientists said they
believed all the</B> <B>ingredients for creating and sustaining life forms
existed in Europa's waters. </B></P>

<P><B>Delaney, a professor of oceanology, said he and other scientists
believed the waters under the ice</B> <B>crust were being warmed by volcanic
activity and undersea research on Earth had shown that</B> <B>&quot;volcanic
activity supports life without sunlight.&quot; </B></P>

<P><B>Richard Terrile of the JPL, a planetary scientist, said he believed
there was organic matter in</B> <B>sediment at the bottom of Europa's ocean
and pointed out: &quot;On Earth, these same ingredients in a</B> <B>million
years gave presence to life.&quot; </B></P>

<P><B>Terrile said he would like to see a &quot;machine exploration&quot;
of Europa during a future unmanned probe to the moon in the hope of confirming
his beliefs. </B></P>

<P><B>Delaney said he was &quot;very excited&quot; by Galileo's pictures.
&quot;The bottom line is, it's about life. The</B> <B>discovery of life
on another planet will surpass anything that has ever taken place in human
history,&quot;he said. </B>&nbsp;<B>He added that volcanic activity not
only sustained life but encouraged it, saying when a volcano</B> <B>erupted
under the ocean on Earth it caused bacteria to &quot;bloom at a massive
level.&quot; </B></P>

<P><B>In an effort to bolster their life-in-outer-space theory, scientists
and engineers from around the world</B> <B>were meeting in Pasadena on
Wednesday and Thursday to discuss an exploration of Lake Vostok,</B> <B>a
subglacial lake under the ice in Antarctica which they believe has conditions
similar to Europa's</B> <B>sea. </B></P>

<P><B>Michael Carr of the United States Geological Survey said there was
evidence of movement and</B> <B>rotation by the icebergs which could not
be explained by wind as Europa is in a vacuum. &quot;The</B> <B>plausible
cause for this motion is traction below which implies liquid below. </B></P>

<P><B>Dr Paul Geissler of the University of Arizona said the pictures showed
the sea as a red-brown area</B> <B>on the surface of Europa. He speculated
that the red-brown material in the waters indicated it was a</B> <B>&quot;muddy
sea,&quot; while Max Coon, a scientist with NorthWest Research Associates,
Inc., concluded</B> <B>after studying the pictures that, &quot;The ice
features here (on Earth) look very, very like the ones on</B> <B>Europa.&quot;
</B></P>

<P><B>Oceanographer Clark Chapman of the Southwest Research Institute said
he believed Europa was</B> <B>still developing and the ice crust was about
one million years old, &quot;a mere day in geological terms.&quot; </B>&nbsp;
</P>

<P><B>The scientists, who make up the Galileo imaging team and whose task
it is to interpret the pictures</B> <B>and data sent back from the spacecraft,
also said it appeared that the ice crust was slowly melting</B> <B>because
of the warmer waters below which were being heated by volcanic activity.
</B>&nbsp; </P>

<P><B>Galileo was launched by the shuttle Atlantis in October, 1989 and
arrived at Jupiter to begin its</B> <B>exploration of the planet and its
moons in December of 1995. </B></P>

<P><B>NEW IMAGES HINT AT WET AND WILD HISTORY FOR EUROPA</B> </P>

<P><B>Chunky ice rafts and relatively smooth, crater-free patches </B></P>

<P><B>on the surface of Jupiter&Otilde;s frozen moon Europa suggest a younger,
</B></P>

<P><B>thinner icy surface than previously believed, according to new </B></P>

<P><B>images from Galileo's spacecraft released today.</B> </P>

<P><B>The images were captured during Galileo's closest flyby of </B></P>

<P><B>Europa on Feb. 20, 1997, when the spacecraft came within 363 miles
</B></P>

<P><B>of the Jovian moon. These features, which lend credence to the </B></P>

<P><B>idea of hidden, subsurface oceans, also are stirring up </B></P>

<P><B>controversy among scientists who disagree about the age of </B></P>

<P><B>Europa's surface.</B> </P>

<P><B>Dr. Ronald Greeley, an Arizona State University geologist and </B></P>

<P><B>Galileo imaging team member, said the ice rafts reveal that Europa
</B></P>

<P><B>had, and may still have, a very thin ice crust covering either </B></P>

<P><B>liquid water or slush. </B></P>

<P><B>&quot;We're intrigued by these blocks of ice, similar to those </B></P>

<P><B>seen on Earth's polar seas during springtime thaws,&quot; Dr. Greeley
</B></P>

<P><B>said. &quot;The size and geometry of these features lead us to believe
</B></P>

<P><B>there was a thin icy layer covering water or slushy ice, and that
</B></P>

<P><B>some motion caused these crustal plates to break up.&quot;</B> </P>

<P><B>&quot;These rafts appear to be floating and may, in fact, be </B></P>

<P><B>comparable to icebergs here on Earth,&quot; said another Galileo
</B></P>

<P><B>imaging team member, Dr. Michael Carr, a geologist with the U.S.
</B></P>

<P><B>Geological Survey. &quot;The puzzle is what causes the rafts to </B></P>

<P><B>rotate. The implication is that they are being churned by </B></P>

<P><B>convection.&quot;</B> </P>

<P><B>The new images of Europa's surface also have sparked a lively </B></P>

<P><B>debate among scientists. Galileo imaging team member Dr. Clark </B></P>

<P><B>Chapman is among those who believe the smoother regions with few
</B></P>

<P><B>craters indicate Europa's surface is much younger than previously
</B></P>

<P><B>believed. In essence, Chapman, a planetary scientist at Southwest
</B></P>

<P><B>Research Institute, Boulder, CO, believes the fewer the craters,
</B></P>

<P><B>the younger the region. Clark based his estimate on current </B></P>

<P><B>knowledge about cratering rates, or the rate at which astronomical
</B></P>

<P><B>bodies are bombarded and scarred by hits from comets and </B></P>

<P><B>asteroids.</B> </P>

<P><B>&Ograve;We're probably seeing areas a few million years old or less,
</B></P>

<P><B>which is about as young as we can measure on any planetary surface
</B></P>

<P><B>besides Earth,&quot; said Chapman. &quot;Although we can't pinpoint
exactly </B></P>

<P><B>how many impacts occurred in a given period of time, these areas
</B></P>

<P><B>of Europa have so few craters that we have to think of its surface
</B></P>

<P><B>as young.&quot; </B></P>

<P><B>Chapman added, &quot;Europa's extraordinary surface geology </B></P>

<P><B>indicates an extreme youthfulness &ETH; a very alive world in a state
</B></P>

<P><B>of flux.&quot;</B> </P>

<P><B>However, Carr sees things differently. He puts Europa's </B></P>

<P><B>surface age at closer to one billion years old.</B> </P>

<P><B>&quot;There are just too many unknowns,&quot; Carr said. &quot;Europa's
</B></P>

<P><B>relatively smooth regions are most likely caused by a different </B></P>

<P><B>cratering rate for Jupiter and Earth. For example, we believe </B></P>

<P><B>that both Earth's moon and the Jovian moon, Ganymede, have huge </B></P>

<P><B>craters that are 3.8 billion years old. But when we compare the </B></P>

<P><B>number of smaller craters superimposed on these large ones, </B></P>

<P><B>Ganymede has far fewer than Earth&Otilde;s moon. This means the </B></P>

<P><B>cratering rate at Jupiter is less than the cratering rate in the
</B></P>

<P><B>Earth-moon system.&quot;</B> </P>

<P><B>Scientists hope to find answers to some of the questions </B></P>

<P><B>surrounding Europa and its possible oceans as the Galileo </B></P>

<P><B>spacecraft continues its journey through the Jovian system. </B></P>

<P><B>&quot;We want to look for evidence of current activity on Europa,
</B></P>

<P><B>possibly some erupting geysers,&quot; Greeley said. &quot;We also
want to </B></P>

<P><B>know whether Europa's surface has changed since the Voyager </B></P>

<P><B>spacecraft flyby in 1979, or even during the time of the Galileo
</B></P>

<P><B>flybys.&quot;</B> </P>

<P><B>The craft will return for another Europa flyby on Nov. 6, </B></P>

<P><B>1997, the final encounter of Galileo's primary mission. However,

<P><B>eight more Europa flybys are planned as part of Galileo's two-year

<H3>New pictures of Europa suggest oceans, possible life </H3>

<P><B>January 17, 1997 Web posted at: 11:00 p.m. EST </B></P>

<P><B>JOHNSON SPACE CENTER, Texas (CNN)</B> </P>

<P><B>-- New pictures of Europa, taken by NASA's Galileo space probe, have
scientists excited at the prospect of an ocean on Jupiter's moon. &nbsp;
Pictures taken by the probe, which flew within 430 miles (692 km) of Europa
on December 19 show a criss-cross of ridges, craters and ice floes stretching
hundreds of miles long. &nbsp; Though they haven't been able to study the
pictures in detail, planetary scientists are able to say they detect signs
of ice-spewing volcanoes and shifts in the moon's icy crust that are not
unlike earthquakes. &nbsp; The features provide evidence that water, heat
and organic compounds may have combined to create an environment suitable
for the start of life, Galileo scientists told a news conference at NASA's
Washington headquarters. &nbsp; &quot;I think Europa is an excellent laboratory
for the existence of possible life,&quot; said Jim Brown, a planetary scientist
at Brown University in Rhode Island. &quot;It's got the ingredients.&quot;
&nbsp; Scientists are eagerly awaiting Galileo's closer look at Europa.
It will pass within 364 miles (587 km) of the moon on February 20. &nbsp;
Galileo, which was launched in 1989 and arrived at Jupiter in 1995, is
making a two-year tour of Jupiter. &nbsp; Reuters contributed to this report.</B>

<P><B>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</B> </P>

<P><B>January 17, 1997</B> </P>

<P><B>ICE VOLCANOES RESHAPE EUROPA'S CHAOTIC SURFACE</B> </P>

<P><B>Ice-spewing volcanoes and the grinding and tearing of tectonic</B>
</P>

<P><B>plates have reshaped the chaotic surface of Jupiter's frozen moon
Europa,</B> </P>

<P><B>images from NASA's Galileo spacecraft reveal.</B> </P>

<P><B>The images, captured when Galileo flew within just 692</B> </P>

<P><B>kilometers (430 miles) of Europa on Dec. 19, were released at a news</B>
</P>

<P><B>briefing today at NASA Headquarters, Washington, DC.</B> </P>

<P><B>Although the images do not show currently active ice volcanoes</B>
</P>

<P><B>or geysers, they do reveal flows of material on the surface that
probably</B> </P>

<P><B>originated from them, said Galileo imaging team member Dr. Ronald
Greeley</B> </P>

<P><B>of Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ.</B> </P>

<P><B>&quot;This is the first time we've seen actual ice flows on any of</B>
</P>

<P><B>the moons of Jupiter,&quot; said Greeley. &quot;These flows, as well
as dark scarring</B> </P>

<P><B>on some of Europa's cracks and ridges, appear to be remnants of ice</B>
</P>

<P><B>volcanoes or geysers.&quot;</B> </P>

<P><B>The new images appear to enhance Europa's prospects as one of</B>
</P>

<P><B>the places in the solar system that could have hosted the development
of</B> </P>

<P><B>life, said Greeley.</B> </P>

<P><B>&quot;There are three main criteria to consider when you are looking</B>
</P>

<P><B>for the possibility of life outside the Earth -- the presence of
water,</B> </P>

<P><B>organic compounds and adequate heat,&quot; said Greeley. &quot;Europa
obviously has</B> </P>

<P><B>substantial water ice, and organic compounds are known to be prevalent
in</B> </P>

<P><B>the solar system. The big question mark has been how much heat is
generated</B> </P>

<P><B>in the interior.</B> </P>

<P><B>&quot;These new images demonstrate that there was enough heat to</B>
</P>

<P><B>drive the flows on the surface. Europa thus has a high potential
to meet</B> </P>

<P><B>the criteria for exobiology,&quot; Greeley added.</B> </P>

<P><B>&quot;This doesn't prove that there is an ocean down there under
the</B> </P>

<P><B>surface of Europa, but it does demonstrate that it is a scientifically</B>
</P>

<P><B>exciting place,&quot; said Galileo imaging team member Dr. Robert
Sullivan, also</B> </P>

<P><B>of Arizona State University.</B> </P>

<P><B>The images also reveal a remarkable diversity in the geological</B>
</P>

<P><B>age of various regions of Europa's surface. Some areas appear relatively</B>
</P>

<P><B>young, with smooth, crater-free terrain, while others contain large
craters</B> </P>

<P><B>and numerous pits, suggesting that they are much older.</B> </P>

<P><B>The icy crust bears the signs of having been disrupted by the</B>
</P>

<P><B>motion of tectonic plates. &quot;There appear to be signs of different
styles of</B> </P>

<P><B>tectonism,&quot; said Greeley. &quot;In many areas we see that the
crust was pulled</B> </P>

<P><B>apart in a spreading similar to the processes on the sea floor on
Earth.</B> </P>

<P><B>This is different from the tectonic processes at work on, say, Jupiter's</B>
</P>

<P><B>moon Ganymede. This suggests that Europa's interior may be different
from</B> </P>

<P><B>Ganymede's.&quot;</B> </P>

<P><B>Galileo scientists will have a better chance to understand</B> </P>

<P><B>Europa's interior when the spacecraft gathers gravity data on another
flyby</B> </P>

<P><B>next November. The gravity field is measured by tracking how the
frequency</B> </P>

<P><B>of Galileo's radio signal changes as it flies past the moon. This
was not</B> </P>

<P><B>possible during the recent flyby because radio conditions were degraded
as</B> </P>

<P><B>Jupiter passed behind the Sun from Earth's point of view.</B> </P>

<P><B>Europa is crisscrossed by an amazingly complex network of</B> </P>

<P><B>ridges, said Sullivan. &quot;Ridges are visible at all resolutions,&quot;
he</B> </P>

<P><B>explained. &quot;Closely paired ridges are most common. With higher
resolution,</B> </P>

<P><B>ridges seen previously as singular features are revealed to be double.&quot;</B>
</P>

<P><B>Some of the ridges may have formed by tension in the icy crust:</B>
</P>

<P><B>as two plates pull apart slightly, warmer material from below might
push up</B> </P>

<P><B>and freeze to form a ridge. Other ridges may have been formed by</B>
</P>

<P><B>compression: as two plates push together, the material where they
meet</B> </P>

<P><B>might crumple to form the ridge.</B> </P>

<P><B>In addition to ice flows and tectonics, Greeley and Sullivan</B>
</P>

<P><B>noted that some areas on Europa seem to have been modified by unknown</B>
</P>

<P><B>processes that scientists are still debating.</B> </P>

<P><B>Greeley said that some areas, for example, seem to have been</B>
</P>

<P><B>modified by &quot;sublimation erosion&quot; -- the evaporation of
water and other</B> </P>

<P><B>volatiles such as ammonia and methane into the vacuum of space. &quot;Something</B>
</P>

<P><B>is destroying the topography,&quot; said Greeley, &quot;and this
sublimation erosion</B> </P>

<P><B>is a good candidate for what is at work.&quot;</B> </P>

<P><B>During last month's encounter, Galileo flew more than 200 times</B>
</P>

<P><B>closer to Europa than the Voyager 2 spacecraft did in 1979. After
a swing</B> </P>

<P><B>past Jupiter next week in what mission engineers call a &quot;phasing
orbit,&quot;</B> </P>

<P><B>Galileo's next targeted flyby will take it again past Europa as it
passes</B> </P>

<P><B>within 587 kilometers (364 miles) on February 20.</B> </P>
