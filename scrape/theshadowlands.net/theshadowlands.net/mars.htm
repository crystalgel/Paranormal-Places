PRIMITIVE LIFE ON EARLY MARS</FONT></U></B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>RELEASE: 96-160</FONT>

<P><B>A NASA research team of scientists at the Johnson Space</B> <B>Center
(JSC), Houston, TX, and at Stanford University, Palo</B> <B>Alto, CA, has
found evidence that strongly suggests primitive</B> <B>life may have existed
on Mars more than 3.6 billion years ago.</B> <B>The NASA-funded team found
the first organic molecules</B> <B>thought to be of Martian origin; several
mineral features</B> <B>characteristic of biological activity; and possible</B>
<B>microscopic fossils of primitive, bacteria-like organisms</B> <B>inside
of an ancient Martian rock that fell to Earth as a</B> <B>meteorite. This
array of indirect evidence of past life will</B> <B>be reported in the
August 16 issue of the journal Science,</B> <B>presenting the investigation
to the scientific community at</B> <B>large for further study.</B> <B>The
two-year investigation was co-led by JSC planetary</B> <B>scientists Dr.
David McKay, Dr. Everett Gibson and Kathie</B> <B>Thomas-Keprta of Lockheed-Martin,
with the major collaboration</B>
<BR><B>of a Stanford team headed by Professor of Chemistry Dr.</B> <B>Richard
Zare, as well as six other NASA and university</B>
<BR><B>research partners.</B> <B>"There is not any one finding that leads
us to believe</B> <B>that this is evidence of past life on Mars. Rather,
it is a</B> <B>combination of many things that we have found," McKay said.</B>
<B>"They include Stanford's detection of an apparently unique</B> <B>pattern
of organic molecules, carbon compounds that are the</B> <B>basis of life.
We also found several unusual mineral phases</B> <B>that are known products
of primitive microscopic organisms on</B> <B>Earth. Structures that could
be microsopic fossils seem to</B> <B>support all of this. The relationship
of all of these things</B> <B>in terms of location - within a few hundred
thousandths of an</B> <B>inch of one another - is the most compelling evidence."</B>
<B>"It is very difficult to prove life existed 3.6 billion</B> <B>years
ago on Earth, let alone on Mars," Zare said. "The</B> <B>existing standard
of proof, which we think we have met,</B> <B>includes having an accurately
dated sample that contains</B> <B>native microfossils, mineralogical features
characteristic of</B> <B>life, and evidence of complex organic chemistry."</B>
<B>"For two years, we have applied state-of-the-art</B> <B>technology to
perform these analyses, and we believe we have</B> <B>found quite reasonable
evidence of past life on Mars," Gibson</B> <B>added. "We don't claim that
we have conclusively proven it.</B> <B>We are putting this evidence out
to the scientific community</B> <B>for other investigators to verify, enhance,
attack -- disprove</B> <B>if they can -- as part of the scientific process.
Then,</B> <B>within a year or two, we hope to resolve the question one
way</B> <B>or the other."</B>
<BR><B>"What we have found to be the most reasonable</B> <B>interpretation
is of such radical nature that it will only be</B>
<BR><B>accepted or rejected after other groups either confirm our</B> <B>findings
or overturn them," McKay added.</B>
<BR><B>The igneous rock in the 4.2-pound, potato-sized</B> <B>meteorite
has been age-dated to about 4.5 billion years, the</B>
<BR><B>period when the planet Mars formed. The rock is believed to</B>
<B>have originated underneath the Martian surface and to have</B> <B>been
extensively fractured by impacts as meteorites bombarded</B> <B>the planets
in the early inner solar system. Between 3.6</B> <B>billion and 4 billion
years ago, a time when it is generally</B> <B>thought that the planet was
warmer and wetter, water is</B> <B>believed to have penetrated fractures
in the subsurface rock,</B> <B>possibly forming an underground water system.</B>
<B>Since the water was saturated with carbon dioxide from</B> <B>the Martian
atmosphere, carbonate minerals were deposited in</B> <B>the fractures.
The team's findings indicate living organisms</B> <B>also may have assisted
in the formation of the carbonate, and</B> <B>some remains of the microscopic
organisms may have become</B> <B>fossilized, in a fashion similar to the
formation of fossils</B> <B>in limestone on Earth. Then, 16 million years
ago, a huge</B> <B>comet or asteroid struck Mars, ejecting a piece of the
rock</B> <B>from its subsurface location with enough force to escape the</B>
<B>planet. For millions of years, the chunk of rock floated</B> <B>through
space. It encountered Earth's atmosphere 13,000 years</B> <B>ago and fell
in Antarctica as a meteorite.</B> <B>It is in the tiny globs of carbonate
that the</B> <B>researchers found a number of features that can be interpreted</B>
<B>as suggesting past life. Stanford researchers found easily</B> <B>detectable
amounts of organic molecules called polycyclic</B> <B>aromatic hydrocarbons
(PAHs) concentrated in the vicinity of</B> <B>the carbonate. Researchers
at JSC found mineral compounds</B> <B>commonly associated with microscopic
organisms and the</B> <B>possible microscopic fossil structures.</B>
<BR><B>The largest of the possible fossils are less than 1/100</B> <B>the
diameter of a human hair, and most are about 1/1000 the</B>
<BR><B>diameter of a human hair - small enough that it would take</B> <B>about
a thousand laid end-to-end to span the dot at the end of</B> <B>this sentence.
Some are egg-shaped while others are tubular.</B> <B>In appearance and
size, the structures are strikingly similar</B> <B>to microscopic fossils
of the tiniest bacteria found on Earth.</B>
<BR><B>The meteorite, called ALH84001, was found in 1984 in</B> <B>Allan
Hills ice field, Antarctica, by an annual expedition of</B>
<BR><B>the National Science Foundation's Antarctic Meteorite Program.</B>
<B>It was preserved for study in JSC's Meteorite Processing</B> <B>Laboratory
and its possible Martian origin was not recognized</B> <B>until 1993. It
is one of only 12 meteorites identified so far</B> <B>that match the unique
Martian chemistry measured by the Viking</B> <B>spacecraft that landed
on Mars in 1976. ALH84001 is by far</B> <B>the oldest of the 12 Martian
meteorites, more than three times</B> <B>as old as any other.</B>
<BR><B>Many of the team's findings were made possible only</B> <B>because
of very recent technological advances in high-</B>
<BR><B>resolution scanning electron microscopy and laser mass</B> <B>spectrometry.
Only a few years ago, many of the features that</B> <B>they report were
undetectable. Although past studies of this</B> <B>meteorite and others
of Martian origin failed to detect</B> <B>evidence of past life, they were
generally performed using</B> <B>lower levels of magnification, without
the benefit of the</B> <B>technology used in this research. The recent
discovery of</B> <B>extremely small bacteria on Earth, called nanobacteria,</B>
<B>prompted the team to perform this work at a much finer scale</B> <B>than
past efforts.</B>
<BR><B>The nine authors of the Science report include McKay,</B> <B>Gibson
and Thomas-Keprta of JSC; Christopher Romanek, formerly</B> <B>a National
Research Council post-doctoral fellow at JSC who is</B> <B>now a staff
scientist at the Savannah River Ecology Laboratory</B> <B>at the University
of Georgia; Hojatollah Vali, a National</B> <B>Research Council post-doctoral
fellow at JSC and a staff</B> <B>scientist at McGill University, Montreal,
Quebec, Canada; and</B> <B>Zare, graduate students Simon J. Clemett and
Claude R.</B> <B>Maechling and post-doctoral student Xavier Chillier of
the</B> <B>Stanford University Department of Chemistry.</B> <B>The team
of researchers includes a wide variety of</B> <B>expertise, including microbiology,
mineralogy, analytical</B> <B>techniques, geochemistry and organic chemistry,
and the</B> <B>analysis crossed all of these disciplines. Further details
on</B> <B>the findings presented in the Science article include:</B> <B>*
Researchers at Stanford University used a dual laser mass</B> <B>spectrometer
-- the most sensitive instrument of its type in</B> <B>the world -- to
look for the presence of the common family of</B> <B>organic molecules
called PAHs. When microorganisms die, the</B> <B>complex organic molecules
that they contain frequently degrade</B> <B>into PAHs. PAHs are often associated
with ancient sedimentary</B> <B>rocks, coals and petroleum on Earth and
can be common air</B> <B>pollutants. Not only did the scientists find PAHs
in easily</B>
<BR><B>detectable amounts</B> <B>in ALH84001, but they found that these
molecules were</B> <B>concentrated in the vicinity of the carbonate globules.
This</B> <B>finding appears consistent with the proposition that they are</B>
<B>a result of the fossilization process. In addition, the</B> <B>unique
composition of the meteorite's PAHs is consistent with</B> <B>what the
scientists expect from the fossilization of very</B> <B>primitive microorganisms.
On Earth, PAHs virtually always</B> <B>occur in thousands of forms, but,
in the meteorite, they are</B> <B>dominated by only about a half-dozen
different compounds. The</B> <B>simplicity of this mixture, combined with
the lack of light-</B> <B>weight PAHs like napthalene, also differs substantially
from</B> <B>that of PAHs previously measured in non-Martian meteorites.</B>
<B>* The team found unusual compounds -- iron sulfides and</B>
<BR><B>magnetite -- that can be produced by anaerobic bacteria and</B>
<B>other microscopic organisms on Earth. The compounds were</B> <B>found
in locations directly associated with the fossil-like</B> <B>structures
and carbonate globules in the meteorite. Extreme</B> <B>conditions -- conditions
very unlikely to have been</B> <B>encountered by the meteorite -- would
have been required to</B> <B>produce these compounds in close proximity
to one another if</B> <B>life were not involved. The carbonate also contained
tiny</B> <B>grains of magnetite that are almost identical to magnetic</B>
<B>fossil remnants often left by certain bacteria found on Earth.</B> <B>Other
minerals commonly associated with biological activity on</B> <B>Earth were
found in the carbonate as well.</B> <B>* The formation of the carbonate
or fossils by living</B> <B>organisms while the meteorite was in the Antarctic
was deemed</B> <B>unlikely for several reasons. The carbonate was age dated</B>
<B>using a parent-daughter isotope method and found to be 3.6</B> <B>billion
years old, and the organic molecules were first</B> <B>detected well within
the ancient carbonate. In addition, the</B> <B>team analyzed representative
samples of other meteorites from</B> <B>Antarctica and found no evidence
of fossil-like structures,</B> <B>organic molecules or possible biologically
produced compounds</B> <B>and minerals similar to those in the ALH84001
meteorite. The</B> <B>composition and location of PAHs organic molecules
found in</B> <B>the meteorite also appeared to confirm that the possible</B>
<B>evidence of life was extraterrestrial. No PAHs were found in</B> <B>the
meteorite's exterior crust, but the concentration of PAHs</B> <B>increased
in the meteorite's interior to levels higher than</B>
<BR><B>ever found in Antarctica. Higher concentrations of PAHs would</B>
<B>have likely been found on the exterior of the meteorite,</B> <B>decreasing
toward the interior, if the organic molecules are</B> <B>the result of
contamination of the meteorite on Earth.</B> <B>Additional information

<CENTER><A NAME="1"></A><FONT SIZE=+2>British Scientists Back Life on Mars
Theory</FONT></CENTER>


<P><B>Thursday October 31 3:33 PM EST</B>

<P><B>LONDON (Reuter) - British astronomers said Thursday they had found
evidence to back reports from U.S. space scientists that they had found
traces of life in a meteorite from Mars.</B>

<P><B>They said samples from two separate Martian meteorites showed definite
traces that could have been left by living organisms, and one was recent
enough to indicate that there still could be life surviving somewhere on
Mars.</B>

<P><B>"We have identified a second meteorite which appears to contain matter
that we define as organic," Colin Pillinger, an astronomer at Britain's
Open University, told a news conference.</B>

<P><B>Pillinger said his team had also taken a second look at a sample
from the meteorite -- known as ALH84001 -- that the U.S. space agency NASA
said contained traces of life.</B>

<P><B>That sample, he said, contained traces of a carbon isotope -- a variant
of carbon -- that is often formed by microscopic life forms on Earth.</B>

<P><B>"These pieces don't actually say that there was definitively life
on Mars, but they tend to redress the balance," Pillinger said.</B>

<P><B>He told the news conference there had been a lot of criticism of
the NASA announcement and scientists wanted to make sure interest in the
subject did not die out.</B>

<P><B>But when they re-examined old meteorites after NASA's announcement
last summer, they were surprised at what they found.</B>

<P><B>NASA said tiny traces in its sample of ALH84001 could have been left
by tiny bacteria. Studies published since then questioned that finding,
some saying the little holes in the ancient Mars rock seemed to have been
formed at temperatures too extreme for life to survive.</B>

<P><B>But Pillinger said his group's findings added weight to NASA's claim.
The carbon isotope, carbon 12, is found in methane on Earth produced by
tiny bacteria that live in places like cow's stomach's and rice paddy fields.</B>

<P><B>NASA's meteorite is believed to have been knocked off Mars by an
asteroid and thrown into orbit 16 million years ago.</B>

<P><B>The second sample, known as EETA79001, is much younger and could
be only 600,000 years old.</B>

<P><B>"This throws it into a time when life would have been teeming on
Earth," Pillinger said.</B>

<P><B>"Geologically speaking this is sufficiently recent for there to be
a good chance that life might still exist in protected areas on our planetary
neighbor." -----------------------------------------------------------------------

<P><B>Thursday October 31 5:54 PM EST</B>

<P><B>UPI Science News</B>

<P><B>LONDON, Oct. 31 (UPI) _ Mars may have had life as recently as 600,000
years ago _ a sign that something might still be alive there _ said three
scientists in the United Kingdom Thursday.</B>

<P><B>At a meeting of the Royal Society hosted by the U.K. minister of
science, researchers presented new evidence to support the idea that meteorites
from Mars show traces left by ancient life.</B>

<P><B>In August, NASA scientists had suggested that a potato-sized chunk
of Mars picked up in Antarctica held traces of one-celled life at least
3.6 billion years old.</B>

<P><B>Now evidence of organic matter has turned up in a much younger meteorite
and in further analysis of the first rock, said Ian Wright, Monica Grady
and Colin Pillinger from Open University.</B>

<P><B>The second meteorite has up to 1,000 parts per million of organic
matter that hitchhiked on the rock as it came from Mars instead of just
smearing onto the surface when it crashed to Earth, said the researchers.</B>

<P><B>This second meteorite formed only 172 million to 177 million years
ago, much later than the 4.5 billion-year-old rock NASA studied. Researchers
have suggested that Martian microbes lived in groundwater that seeped through
tiny cracks and pores in the rock, and might have been thriving until the
rock left the planet. Previous studies concluded that the young meteorite
shot into space some 600,000 years ago, perhaps when a huge rock slammed
into the planet and kicked up debris.</B>

<P><B>This finding brings the possibility of Martian life much closer.
The NASA team had estimated their traces were 3.6 billion years old.</B>

<P><B>The researchers also studied the same rock that NASA had examined.
The ratio of carbon forms in the older meteorite matches the pattern of
living microbes producing methane. That pattern can only be produced by
something living, at least as far as Earth scientists have observed.</B>

<P><B>The researchers also pointed out that the pattern of components in
the meteorite matched a pattern in organic matter in the Earth's oldest
fossils.</B>

<P><B>``This is fairly strong supporting evidence,'' said NASA's Everett
Gibson, from the Johnson Space Center in Houston, one of the NASA scientists
who proposed the meteorites held traces left by ancient life. ``We're really
quite pleased,'' he said.</B>

<P><B>He would not comment on whether the new evidence makes current life
on Mars seem more likely. He did point out that if both meteorite analyses
are right, life on Mars survived a long time.</B>

<P><B>Michael Meyer from NASA headquarters in Washington, a specialist
in the search for life in space but not a member of either team of meteorite
analysts, said the new announcement was stirring up considerable excitement
in the planetary science community. The new evidence is ``pretty strong,''
he said. Finding traces that from such a young meteorite _ young at least
in the eyes of astronomers _ raises hope for finding traces of life now.
``Six hundred thousand years ago? That's yesterday!'' Meyer said.</B>

<P><B>after the new evidence, ``I think you'd get people to bet there's
life on Mars,'' Meyer said.</B>

<P><B>There is considerable interest in this unusual feature on the surface
of Mars.</B>

<P><B>It was photographed during the NASA Viking mission to Mars, and NASA's
official position is that it is probably a "natural" formation, created
by simple wind erosion. Many investigators feel otherwise, including Richard
Hoagland, who helped bring this to the public's attention.</B>

<P><B>He, and many others, have come to the conclusion that it must have
been deliberately constructed (perhaps carved from a natural hill that
was already there). The builders, if any, are unknown, but given the advanced
alien presence we currently seem to be dealing with on our own planet,
it may very well be that these same beings constructed this fascinating
feature.</B>

<P><B>The object is approximately a mile long, from the chin to the top
of the head. The eye sockets are nearly the size of a football field, and
it rises 15 hundred feet above the flat suface of the Cydonia region of
Mars. The black spot on the right side of the face is a reference mark
in the image, not part of the feature itself. The dark area under the chin
is a shadow being cast by the feature.</B>

<P><B>Computer analysis has shown it to be greater than 95% symmetrical,
which makes it very unlikely that it is a naturally eroded formation. This
symmetry means that the features on the right half of the "face" are 95%
identical to the features on the left side, and the two sides are a mirror
image (just as in a real face). Even the "hair" matches on each side.</B>

<P><B>The question is, if alien beings contructed this "face," what was
or is the purpose? One possibility is that it may have been intended as
a "sign" for humanity to find, when we were able: one more clue that there
are "other intelligences out there." Some people have pointed out that
this is similar in concept to the strange monolith found on the moon in
the film 2001: A Space Odyssey.</B>

<P><B>THE SAME NASA team that says it found microbial life in a Martian
meteor now claim two other meteors contain similar fossilized remnants.</B>

<P><B>What appear to be bacteria are contained in two meteorites believed
to be from Mars, according to a team led by Johnson Space Center geologist
David S. McKay, who presented his findings Thursday at the Lunar and Planetary
Science Conference.</B>

<P><B>The NASA team's latest findings, made within the past six months,
were from samples of a 1.3 billion-year-old meteorite that fell to Earth
in 1911 near Nakhla, Egypt, and a 165 million-year-old meteorite that fell
near Shergotty, India, in 1865.</B>

<P><B>"My own opinion is that these will turn out to be true micro-fossils
from Mars," McKay said. "We're not counting on getting many converts. All
we ask, though, is that people keep an open mind."</B>

<P><B>The scientist was one of the researchers who in August 1996 announced
the discovery of tiny fossilized structures in crevices of a 4 billion-year-old
Mars meteorite found in the Allan Hills region of Antarctica in 1984.</B>

<P><B>For the past three years, rival researchers and other scientists
have debated the significance of the NASA team's earlier findings from
Mars. Independent analyses of the Mars rock have failed to yield absolute
evidence that the potato-sized chunk ever contained life.</B>

Water Ice on Mars</FONT></B>
<BR><B>Fri Mar 1, 2002&nbsp; 4:34 PM ET</B>
<BR><B>By Dan Whitcomb</B>

<P><B>PASADENA, Calif. (Reuters) - The Mars Odyssey spacecraft has identified
what appear to be large areas of ice on the red planet's surface, a discovery
(news - web sites) that could prove key to the search for life there, U.S.
space scientists said on Friday,</B>

<P><B>Odyssey, which began mapping the Martian surface last week, used
a suite of gamma ray spectrometer instruments to detect significant amounts
of hydrogen near the planet's south pole, which scientists said are most
likely due to the presence of ice formed from water.</B>

<P><B>"We're not looking at just surface frost, there's really a lot of
ice," said William Boynton, professor at the University of Arizona's Lunar
and Planetary Laboratory said during a press conference at NASA (news -
web sites)'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.</B>

<P><B>Earlier missions to Mars by NASA's Viking Orbiter and Global Surveyor
spacecraft have previously suggested that ice might be found on the red
planet and scientists have concluded that water once flowed there, creating
deep canyons and other geologic features that can still be seen.</B>

<P><B>But the findings by Odyssey, which was launched in April of 2001
and arrived in Mars orbit in October, could provide the first real proof
of ice still formed on the surface.</B>

<P><B>"We're delighted with the quality of the data we're seeing," Stephen
Saunders, Odyssey project scientist, said. "We'll use it to build on what
we've learned from Mars Global Surveyor and other missions. Now we may
actually see water rather than guessing where it is or was."</B>

<P><B>Scientists said preliminary assessment of the data suggest the presence
of hydrogen in the upper few feet of the Martian surface in an area about
400 miles across.</B>

<P><B>"If you were an astronaut walking around on the surface of Mars you
could kick the ground and see ice crystals," Boynton said. "You could melt
it and have water."</B>

<P><B>Boynton said scientists were excited about the discovery because
