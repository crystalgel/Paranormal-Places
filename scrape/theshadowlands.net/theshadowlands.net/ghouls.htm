<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Oftentimes it is difficult to pinpoint
where something originates, but commonly the birth of ghouls occurred in
Arabic speaking countries.&nbsp; There is not a country today that does
not have its own</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">history of ghouls.&nbsp; India, China,
Arabia, Germany, France, and Mongolia are just a few countries that have
an early history of ghouls.</FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">What is a ghoul?&nbsp; Well, today's
definition is someone who kills without thought, mutilates the corpse,
and perhaps dines on it either by drinking the blood or eating the flesh.&nbsp;
Today's definition is</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">based on encounters of the past.&nbsp;
Ghouls are flesh eaters.&nbsp; While they are more frequently associated
with corpses, they are known to feed on human children, infants, and occasionally
weak and sickened adults.&nbsp; Ghouls are rumored to live near graveyards
and in desolate places where they can safely feed on the freshly deceased
and for attacking and feasting on a tired unsuspecting traveler.</FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;Some believe ghouls are reanimated
corpses possessed by evil spirits that have very little control over the
body thus the staggering and lurching walk. Many have linked ghouls with
vampires.&nbsp; As with vampires, a person can become a ghoul by the quality
of life he or she lived.&nbsp; Ghouls are also reportedly failed vampires
- this means that they did not fully develop into a vampire at the time
of their death.</FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">There are many similarities between
ghouls and vampires.&nbsp; Like vampires, ghouls are nocturnal creatures,
repelled by sunlight, and both can feast on the living.&nbsp; However,
unlike vampires, ghouls are driven by their intense hunger, they eat flesh
and not solely blood, and finally, they are not in control of their bodies.&nbsp;
Any intelligence that was once present in their life is no longer present</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">and they can only communicate with
grunts or hisses.</FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Ghouls are commonly described as having
long arms, sinewy legs, gaunt faces, large and sometimes bulging eyes,
razor sharp teeth, hands that are claw-like, and thick fibrous blue-gray
skin.&nbsp; Their claws are extremely sharp and are used to dig in the
dirt and to rip apart flesh.</FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">It is reported that China has the most
malevolent of ghouls.&nbsp; They are condemned to be a disembodied spirit
because of their evil earthly life.&nbsp; They can take on a visible form
and when they do, they are seen as tall, dark, with huge ears, large tongue
and tusk like teeth.&nbsp; Like their counterparts in other countries,
they feed on corpses and the living flesh of those weaker or unsuspecting.&nbsp;
They are credited with causing minor diseases.</FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">In Paris in 1849 Sergeant Francoise
Bertrand was executed for opening&nbsp; graves and partaking of their flesh.&nbsp;
While many label him a vampire, his behavior is closer to that of a ghoul.&nbsp;
A generation later in 1886, Henri Blot was found to have committed the
same type of crimes.</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT></B>&nbsp;<B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">The wilderness of Afghanistan and Iran
bring us stories of the monstrous ghoul, Ghul-I Beaban.</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Ghouls are not in control of their
bodies, they experience no pain, no aging, do not require air to breathe
and have regenerative powers which makes them difficult to kill.&nbsp;
To destroy a ghoul one must surprise them or overwhelm them in sheer number
as they will fight if forced to with speed and agility coupled with fierceness.&nbsp;
While it is difficult to kill a ghoul, it is possible.&nbsp; One must burn,</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">decapitate, pour concentrated acid
or electrocute them.</FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Is it possible that the corpses that
were removed from their graves and eaten actually disturbed by hungry animals?
This is a possibility but we cannot credit animals with every ghoul activity.</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Take a minute and think about the medical
profession of the 1800's and earlier.&nbsp; Doctors were present but their
expertise in recognizing ailments and even death was not 100%.&nbsp; Comas
and some diseases will slow the breathing and heart rate to almost nothing.&nbsp;
Most graveyards were in desolate areas where there were no lights and no
modern conveniences that would tell them that the corpse in question might
still be alive.&nbsp; What would you do, if you awoke in a dirt grave,
had to dig your way out after waking from a coma or "dead" sleep to discover
that maybe you're really dead.&nbsp; The traumatic shock of finding yourself
in a grave would be enough to disorient anyone and then to find your way
home only to have your family and friends scream in fear at the mere sight
of you.&nbsp; The thought of eating dead flesh might not be as horrifying
as one would have thought.</FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">So it is possible that the above two
are possible scenarios for creating ghouls.&nbsp; Then there is the thought
that if one were evil in life, what happens with the soul or evilness of
the living when death</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">occurs?&nbsp; It is a common belief
that the soul of a good person lives on in heaven or stays around to protect
their loved ones.&nbsp; Is it possible that evil can be so strong to reanimate
a corpse and</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">continue to spread evil?&nbsp; Or is
it possible that there are so many people such as Sergeant Bertrand, Henri
Blot and modern day "flesh eating" ghouls who have simply acquired the
taste for flesh?</FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">While the ghouls we hear about most
often are modern day flesh eaters in well-populated places, there is still
a vast world of desolate places with unsuspecting people who are in jeopardy
of continuing past beliefs.</FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT></B>
