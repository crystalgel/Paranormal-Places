    directly; 'C' indirectly).
      (c) Quarantine means the detention, examination and
    decontamination of any person, property, animal or other form of
    life or matter whatever that is extraterrestrially exposed, and

      (a) Administrative actions.  The Administrator or his designee as
    authorized by Sec. 1204.509 of this chapter shall in his
    discretion:
      (1) Determine the beginning and duration of a quarantine period

    applies to various life forms will be announced.
      (2) Designate in writing quarantine officers to exercise
    quarantine authority.
      (3) Determine that a particular person, property, animal, or
    other form of life or matter whatever is extraterrestrially exposed
    and quarantine such person, property, animal, or other form of life
    or matter whatever.  The quarantine may be based only on a
    determination, with or without the benefit of a hearing, that there
    is probable cause to believe that such person, property, animal or
    other form of life or matter whatever is extraterrestrially
    exposed.
      (4) Determine within the United States or within vessels or
    vehicles of the United States the place, boundaries, and rules of
    operation of necessary quarantine stations.
      (5) Provide for guard services by contract or otherwise, as may
    be necessary, to maintain security and inviolability of quarantine
    stations and quarantined persons, property, animals, or other form
    of life or matter whatever.
      (6) Provide for the subsistence, health, and welfare of persons
    quarantined under the provisions of this part.
      (7) Hold such hearings at such times, in such manner and for such
    purposes as may be desirable or necessary under this part,
    including hearings for the purpose of creating a record for use in
    making any determination under this part or for the purpose of
    reviewing any such determination.
      (8) Cooperate with the Department of Health, Education, and
    Welfare and the Department of Agriculture in accordance with the
    provisions of Sec. 1211.105.
      (9) Take such other actions as may be prudent or necessary and
    which are consistent with this part.
      (b) Quarantine. (1) During any period of announced quarantine,
    the property within the posted perimeter of the Lunar Receiving
    Laboratory at the Manned Spacecraft Center, Houston, Tex., is
    designated as the NASA Lunar Receiving Laboratory Quarantine
    Station.
      (2) Other quarantine stations may be established if determined
    necessary as provided in paragraph (a)(4) of this section.
      (3) During any period of announced quarantine, no person shall
    enter or depart from the limits of any quarantine station without
    permission of the cognizant NASA quarantine officer.  During such
    period, the posted perimeter of a quarantine station shall be
    secured by armed guard.
      (4) Any person who enters the limits of any quarantine station
    during the quarantine period shall be deemed to have consented to
    the quarantine of his person if it is determined that he is or has
    become extraterrestrially exposed.
      (5) At the earliest practicable time, each person who is
    quarantined by NASA shall be given a reasonable opportunity to
    communicate by telephone with legal counsel or other persons of his
    choice.

      (a) If either the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare or
    the Department of Agriculture exercises its authority to quarantine
    an extraterrestrially exposed person, property, animal, or other
    form of life or matter whatever, NASA will, except as provided in
    paragraph (c) of this section, not exercise the authority to
    quarantine that same person, property, animal, or other form of
    life or matter whatever.  In such cases, NASA will offer to these
    departments the use of the Lunar Receiving Laboratory Quarantine
    Station and such other service, equipment, personnel, and
    facilities as may be necessary to ensure an effective quarantine.
      (b) If neither the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare
    or the Department of Agriculture exercises its quarantine
    authority.  NASA shall exercise the authority to quarantine an
    extraterrestrially exposed person, property, animal or other form
    of life or matter whatever.  In such cases, NASA will inform these
    departments of such quarantine action and, in addition, may request
    the use of such service, equipment, personnel and facilities of
    other Federal departments and agencies as may be necessary to
    ensure an effective quarantine.
      (c) NASA shall quarantine NASA astronauts and other NASA
    personnel as determined necessary and all NASA property involved in
