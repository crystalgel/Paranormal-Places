<b><font face="ARIAL"><font color="#FFCCFF">Myth &amp; Lore:</font></font></b>
<br><font face="ARIAL"><font color="#CC66CC">A vampire feeds on the life
essence of their victims. This usually occurs by drinking the blood of
their victim. The reasons that the vampire needs blood to survive varies
from culture to culture. Some feel that the vampire needs blood to flow
through their veins to keep their bodies animated and limit the damage
of decay. Others feel that the beasts feed as a sadistic habit in order
to wreak havoc and fear.</font></font>
<br><font face="ARIAL"><font color="#CC66CC">This theory of course also
makes on think that it may not be the blood that animates the vampire,
but the fear &amp; pain. Vampires aren't particular they will drink the
blood of animals as well as humans.</font></font>
<p><font face="ARIAL"><font color="#CC66CC">The most obvious characteristic
that you think of when referring to the vampire is of course that the creature
is dead a yet walks among the living. Most tales of vampirism tell us that
these beings have fangs, are afraid of sunlight, they can shape-shift,
(i.e. bats and wolves), they cry tears of blood, sleep in a coffin during
the day and have extreme levels of strength and speed. Of course it goes
without saying that this creature is immortal, unless of course killed
using the proper methods.</font></font>
<p><font face="ARIAL"><font color="#CC66CC">As stated before different
cultures have different myths about the vampires. For instancing European
beliefs the vampire is dead, zombie like, hideously deformed from death
and inherently evil. Whereas the American legend has been handed to us
by Hollywood. The creature is a sensual, desirable one. Most of our movies
and fiction combine the myth and legend of Europe, but also adds the dash
of Americana, making this being a seductive beauty, with brawn as well
as brains, and sometimes even a dash of compassion.</font></font>
<p><font face="ARIAL"><font color="#CC66CC">Who is a vampire? Are you predestined
from birth to become one of the undead? In older lore vampires were people
who died unnaturally and couldn't face the fact that they were truly dead.
In my research I found some really fun and interesting ways of becoming
one with the undead. The most common way of becoming is of course being
bitten by a vampire. From here on the becoming is very bizarre. Lets start
with some of the predisposition's; being conceived on a holy day, being
weaned too early, being born the seventh son of the seventh son or receiving
a curse. The last two are my personal favorites a mother who did not eat
enough salt during pregnancy and a mother being stared at by a vampire
while pregnant. Enough of predisposition's, lets move onto ways that you
can cause yourself to become a vampire. Common beliefs in older lore include
being a witch or were-wolf, being cruel or evil person, committing suicide,
being murdered or being the murderer. All these things can make you a vampire
upon death. But wait, there are more ways to be a do-it-yourselfer. These
are my personal favorites in this category; eating sheep killed by a wolf,
leading an immoral life, (i.e. prostitutes &amp; treacherous barmaids),
or (for a priest) saying mass while in the state of mortal sin. For the
Europeans after death becomings include; wind from the Russian Steppe blowing
on the corpse and being buried face up in the grave, the latter of the
two believed in certain parts of Romania. Other after death causes of the
becoming are; having a cat or other animal jump or fly over a corpse, having
a shadow fall on a corpse, no burial or improper burial rites, murder that
is unrevenged, having ones brother sleep walk (?), death by drowning and
finally stealing the ropes used to bury the corpse. So my research turned
up many way to become a vampire.</font></font>
<p><font face="ARIAL"><font color="#CC66CC">How do you detect that someone
is a vampire? Ever wonder if your friends, family or teachers are just
Vampires leeching you dry? The following suggestions are taken basically
from old myths and lore. If you find a corpse that is bloated, showed blood
in the mouth, grew long nails and hair chances are that you are dealing
with a vampire. (Of course in modern times we have realized that the previous
conditions are all part of decomposition.) To detect a vampire at graveside
or in the cemetery, if you are not looking for anyone in particular, first
look for fingersized holes around the grave, look for disturbed dirt, constant
mists, disturbed coffins, moved or fallen tombstones footprints leading
to and from the grave, (just make sure that they aren't your own), no birds
singing, dogs barking and refusing to enter the cemetery, geese screaming
when near the suspected grave and last, but not least, groaning sounds
from under the earth.</font></font>
<p><font face="ARIAL"><font color="#CC66CC">If you think that someone you
know has been a victim of vampirism or might possibly be a vampire here
are some ways of detection. If the supposed victim suffers from one or
more of the following list chances are that you are dealing with the undead.
Things to look for are sleeplessness, nightmares, anemia, bite marks on
the neck, (dead give away), exhaustion, nervousness, irritability, sleepwalking,
difficulty in breathing, no appetite, weight loss, aversion to garlic,
strange dental growths and photosensitivity. All taken together means that
you are either dealing with a vampire or a parent of young children.</font></font>
<p><font face="ARIAL"><font color="#CC66CC">The appearance of the suggested
vampire is also important. You should look for the following; fangs, red
eyes, long fingernails, paleness, reluctance to enter a house without an
invitation, hairy palms and aversion to bright lights. Also look to see
if your family and/or friends have a reflection or cast a shadow.</font></font>
<p><font face="ARIAL"><font color="#CC66CC">Once you have determined that
you are dealing with the undead, the following information is to help you
prevent, protect and destroy your evil demon. Prevention for pre-burial
is fun, here is just a sampling of what I found; destroyed vampire that
caused death, close all windows, prevent moonlight from falling on the
corpse, cover all mirrors, (keep in mind that these are old rituals used
when people still buried their own), place corn or garlic in mouth and
cover all standing water. Now for some of my personal favorites; pour incense
into eyes, nose and ears of victim. Bind the body of the victim by tying
the mouth shut, tying legs or feet together, weld the toes together (?),
and then wrap in carpet or net. Decapitate the corpse and place the head
under the arm or between legs or bury it in a separate grave. The number
one favorite to prevent a loved one from becoming one of the undead, stretch
a dead cat or dog across the threshold to the house.</font></font>
<p><font face="ARIAL"><font color="#CC66CC">If your prevention does not
work, then you should try to protect yourself and your loved ones from
the same fate. Garlic of course is one well-known method. It can be used
on windows, doors, around the neck and under armpits (?); if you mix it
with water it can be sprinkled or sprayed throughout an area. Also try
fishnets on windows, doors and graves, for some unknown reason vampires
are obsessed with untangling objects. Seeds are another way to protect
yourself, just sprinkle into yard or walkways; vampires are compelled to
count seeds (i.e. the count on Sesame Street). Holy water is yet another
popular way of protection. Bells ringing will keep the undead away if ringing
constantly. My last suggestion would be placing mirrors on the doors, because,
as one author put it, it really annoys the vampire that they cannot see
their own reflection.</font></font>

<p><font face="ARIAL"><font color="#CC66CC">Now that I have given you the
information to detect, prevent and protect yourself from the evil critters,
lets move onto Myths of the creation of the vampire. Many authors have
written about vampires and their creation, but the story or myth that is
my favorite is the "Myth of Merrydeath" by an unknown author.</font></font>
<p><font face="ARIAL"><font color="#CC66CC">The tale tells of a beautiful
queen ruling for her children in ancient times. Keep in mind that this
is a time when men were still new to the earth. Queen Meredith had taken
a lover after years of being alone due to the king's death. Her lover was
Mambayan, a warrior chieftain and close friend of the king. Well as all
good love stories go, her lover was wounded in battle. Also around the
same time a vampfara was imprisoned in the castle keep. Meredith tried
everything in her power to save Manbayan, but to no avail. Death was imminent.
An old crone suggested that since the vampfara appeared to be able to heal
itself, maybe they should try the blood of the vampfara to heal Manbayan.
Meredith formed an idea in her mind to visit the vampfara and request his
help. That very same night she did visit the vampfara. When she requested
his blood to save her lover. The vampfara thought about her request and
he requested his freedom in return. He told her that she must carry his
blood inside of her, as it had to be kept warm. He bit her and drank her
blood greedily and just as she was about to die he sliced his wrist and
held it to her mouth, making her drink his blood. Then he told her that
in order to save her lover she must repeat the same procedure. Of course
they have now died and been made into vampires. The kingdom rebelled against
the lovers who now walked with the undead and cast them out. As the story
goes they are still roaming the night together and the vampfarant was freed
as per agreement. That is the myth of Queen Merrydeath.</font></font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="ARIAL"><font color="#FFCCFF">History:</font></font></b>
<br><font face="ARIAL"><font color="#CC66CC">When you think about vampires
usually the first name that you think of is Dracula. Bram Stoker is the
man who penned the famous novel "Dracula". It is thought this story that
most of us are introduced to vampires.</font></font>
<p><font face="ARIAL"><font color="#CC66CC">"Dracula" was actually based
on a true Romanian Prince named Vlad Tepes, (pronounced Tzepesh). He was
seen as a hero by his countrymen. According to most legend he was considered
a fair, but very cruel man. Most of the information about this prince has
been handed down to us by verbal tradition in his homeland, and by Russian
and German pamphlets printed shortly after his death. The verbal form tells
us of his conquests for his country, whereas the pamphlets portrayed him
as an evil demon.</font></font>
<p><font face="ARIAL"><font color="#CC66CC">The name Dracula (draculaea)
simply means son of the Dracul. The name Dracul seems a little harder to
decipher. Some say that it means demon or devil, while other historians
assert that Vlad the II belonged as a knight of the order of the dragon,
hence the surname dracul- dragon, the insignia of the order was a dragon
being knocked down by a cross. The knights were a group of Slavic rulers
and warlords sworn to uphold the Christian faith against the Turks. The
name Tepes is also report to mean "the impaler".</font></font>
<p><font face="ARIAL"><font color="#CC66CC">So that was the history of
the name, but who was this man so closely connected to the vampire. His
life started off well as the son of the prince of Wallachia. At a young
age he was captured by the Turks and imprisoned by the Sultan. It has been
suggested that Vlad developed his sadistic tendencies during his captivity,
as he would not convert his allegiance to the Sultan. Vlad was eventually
released as the Turks thought him subdued.</font></font>
<p><font face="ARIAL"><font color="#CC66CC">Vlad the III actually ruled
Wallachia three separate times as the prince or voevod (warlord). He first
ruled in 1448, he left the throne the same year because he realized that
at that moment in time he was not strong enough to defeat the Turks. His
second term as ruler began in 1456. He ruled well with the help of his
allies, he ensured peace in his country. He was always depicted as a sever
ruler. He was ousted by his brother with the help of the Turks, in 1462.
His third and final rule only lasted a month in 1476. At this time he was
beaten in battle by the Turks and killed afterward. His head was presented
to the Sultan as proof of his death and his body buried in a monastery.
An interesting footnote to this story is that when Dracula- Vlad Tepes
the III's grave was later opened all that was found was a pile of horse
bones.</font></font>
<p><font face="ARIAL"><font color="#CC66CC">Of course there were reasons
why the Turks were afraid of Dracula and his countrymen considered him
so severe in his punishments. Vlad the III was known as the impaler because
that is how he killed many of his opponents. There are numerous stories
that tell of the atrocities committed by the man.</font></font>
<p><font face="ARIAL"><font color="#CC66CC">One story tells of how he impaled
his victims in geometric patterns, the height of the stake indicated the
rank of the victim. The corpses were often left rotting for months as a
deterrent to the Turkish armies. Vlad was not just an impaler, he also
had a few other tortures that he seemed to favor such as, nails in the
head, cutting off limbs, blinding, strangulation, burning, mutilation of
sexual organs, scalping and skinning. The list seems to go on and on, too
morbid to continue.</font></font>
<p><font face="ARIAL"><font color="#CC66CC">He did not like the noblemen
of his country, because they were untrustworthy, and he often employed
his methods of torture against them as well as his enemies. At one point
he even had his noblemen building Dracula Castle. It has also been reported
that he was not fond of the ailing or poor. To rid his country of these
people he held a feast for them. At the end of the feast ordered his soldiers
to bar up the exits and burn the great hall to the ground. His reason for
this was so that the poor and invalid would no longer be a burden to his
countrymen.</font></font>
<p><font face="ARIAL"><font color="#CC66CC">There is never any mention
of Vlad the III being a Vampire, just a sadistic ruler. Vlad was a hero
to his people, even though his methods of his punishment were unequivocally
severe and cruel. He helped defeat the Turks and kept them out of Romania
for many years. I have used many different sources for this history and
all tell the tale a little differently, but the same basic premise is the
same throughout all sources. (See acknowledgements at the end of the article.)</font></font>
<p><font face="ARIAL"><font color="#CC66CC">There are other famous people
in history that were considered vampires. In the next few paragraphs I
will tell of Elizabeth Bathory, the Vampire of Croglin Range, Arnold Paole,
John George Haige, Fritz Haarmann, Martin Dummolard and Peter Kurten.</font></font>
<p><font face="ARIAL"><font color="#CC66CC">Elizabeth Bathory was a Transylvanian
noblewoman born in 1560. She was married to Count Ferencz Nadasdy. By the
age of 25 years old she became obsessed with her beauty and terrified of
growing old. When her husband died in 1604 Elizabeth moved back to her
family lands in Vienna. She began to practice certain forms of sorcery,
which included attending rituals that sacrificed animals.</font></font>
<p><font face="ARIAL"><font color="#CC66CC">Elizabeth became obsessed with
blood by accident. She was correcting a servant girl for not performing
her duties to the satisfaction of the countess. Elizabeth went after the
young girl with a pair of scissors. Her blood was splayed over Elizabeth,
whom upon cleaning discovered that it made her skin more youthful. This
started her descent into hell; it is thought that she participated in the
murders of over 600 young girls. She preferred the blood of younger girls
and considered them to be her fountain of youth. She would torture her
victims for weeks and sometimes month before actually killing them. By
December of 1610, only six years after the death of her husband, she was
brought to trial for her atrocities and found guilty. Due to the fact that
she was a noblewoman she would not be put to death for her crimes. She
was sentenced to life imprisonment in her own home. She was placed in a
small room with no windows or doors, only an opening for food to passed
through and slits for air. The documents of her trial were sealed, when
later found they were not completely intact. The rumors still circulated
that not only did she bath in the blood of her victims, but she also drank
it as well.</font></font>
<p><font face="ARIAL"><font color="#CC66CC">The vampire of Croglin Range
is another interesting story. There is no exact name given to this creature,
but when chased by one of the victim's families, it disappeared into an
old family crypt that had been in the town for hundreds of years. When
the vault was opened by the town's people it was discovered that all the
coffins but one had been destroyed. Inside the remaining coffin was a mummified
corpse with a fresh bullet wound. The villagers disturbed by this sight
of the corpse removed the vile being and burnt it on a funeral pyre. That
vampire visits the town of Croglin Range no more.</font></font>
<p><font face="ARIAL"><font color="#CC66CC">Arnold Paole is another unique
character in history. This story is actually documented and can be found
in a few history books from the area. Arnold Paole was from Medvenga, near
Belgrade. The story goes that he returned home from Greece in 1727, where
he had served in the army. Upon his return he married a local girl. He
often told her that he feared an early demise. Sure enough, while working
on his farm he fell from a great height and was returned home, he from
internal injuries within a few days. After a month townspeople had begun
reporting that they had seen Arnold in their homes. These people soon turned
up dead from reasons unknown. Arnold's body was exhumed. When the coffin
was opened they found the body had experienced no decomposition, old skin
and nails had been replaced by new. There was even fresh blood on his lips.
A member of the group that had exhumed the body staked Arnold. The corpse
sat up and screamed, fresh blood flowed from the wound. The group then
began to do the same to all of Arnold's victims, careful to surround the
bodies with garlic. All was quiet until 1732 when there was another group
of unexplained deaths. The town took no chances this time and exhumed all
of the corpses to investigate. Again they found no decomposition among
the bodies, so they performed the ritual again. One theory explaining the
second outbreak was that Arnold had also attacked cattle as well as people
and when the cattle was slaughtered for meat and consumed the vampire qualities
were passed on to the innocent victims.</font></font>
<p><font face="ARIAL"><font color="#CC66CC">John George Haige was another
character in history whose claim to fame was vampirism. In 1944 the "Acid
Bath Vampire" was born. John had a troubled youth in Wakefield, England.
He claimed to have a reoccurring dream about a forest of crucifixes, the
crucifixes would turn into trees dripping blood. There was a man there
to collect the blood and offer it to John, but that was when he would wake
up, never tasting the offering. He would later rent a basement workshop
and shortly thereafter commit his first murder. He only drained enough
fresh blood from his first victim to fill a cup, which he would drink.
Then he would dispose of the body by dumping it into a bathtub and pouring
acid on it, letting it melt until only sludge would remain. Then he would
gather the sludge and dump it down a manhole located in the workshop. He
killed many victims this way and was caught because of his increasing acid
orders. This led to his arrest, where he confessed everything. It only
took a Jury 15 minutes to deliberate and return with a guilty verdict.
He was hung on August 10, 1949.</font></font>
<p><font face="ARIAL"><font color="#CC66CC">Another fun character was Fritz
Haarmann. He and two accomplices committed many grisly murders. Fritz was
into cannibalism and like biting his victims on the throat. His other good
qualities consisted of being a child molester and selling the flesh of
his victims to unsuspecting customers in his cook-shop. Fritz was beheaded
in April of 1925. His brain was donated to science for research.</font></font>
<p><font face="ARIAL"><font color="#CC66CC">Martin Dummolard was a man
possessed by a woman. He was called the "Monster of Montluel". Martin met
his mistress Justine Lafayette when he moved into her boarding house. Martin
would drink the blood of his victims and take the fleshier parts home for
Justine to eat. They murdered close to eighty girls before being caught
in 1888. Justine was beheaded by the guillotine, and Martin spent the remainder
of his life in an asylum for the criminally insane.</font></font>
<p><font face="ARIAL"><font color="#CC66CC">Our final story takes place
in Germany and is about a man named Peter Kurten. The "Vampire of Dusseldorf"
as he was known, was the son of an alcoholic father and a mother who just
didn't care about anything. He was a truck driver, a bespectacled little
man, very unassuming, however, this man was able to assault or murder twenty-nine
people during his reign of terror. His victims were strangled, raped and
then he would slit their throats so that he could drink their blood. He
married, hoping that it help him to control his urges. This did not work.
He was a devoted husband by day and an evil creature by night. Eventually,
he confessed his crimes to his wife, who then turned him in to the police.
He was convicted and sentenced to death in 1931. He wrote letters to the
families of his victims, stating with no remorse that some people crave
alcohol, where as, he craved blood and apparently needed some kind of sexual
fulfillment.</font></font>
<p><font face="ARIAL"><font color="#CC66CC">Of course these are just a
small sampling of those in history that were considered vampires. These
people needed or craved blood to survive just as our Vampires of lore needed
blood to survive.</font></font>
<p><font face="ARIAL"><font color="#CC66CC">Are there really vampires?
That is for you the reader to decide. Those who lust for blood must have
some reason for this need, but again that is for you to decide.If you have
any questions please contact me at <a href="mailto:cat@theshadowlands.com.">cat@theshadowlands.com.

will do my best to answer them.</font></font><br>
