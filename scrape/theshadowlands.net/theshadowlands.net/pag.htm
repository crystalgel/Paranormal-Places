<CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>UNIDENTIFIED LIGHTS ABOVE PAG… AGAIN</FONT></CENTER>


<P>There really is something unsual about the island of Pag. After all
those sightings of strange lights I already wrote about and finding that
huge triangle carved into rock, not to mention rocks falling from nowhere,
there was another sighting this week.
<BR>During Tuesday afternoon (June 4th) and the night from Tuesday to Wednesday
(from June 4th to 5th, 2002), above Velebit, Podvelebitski channel and
Pag, an unusual light phenomenon has been sighted. First sighting has been
reported by phone to
<BR>local radio station, Radio Pag, just after 6 p.m., and another one
at 8:30 p.m.

<P>Among the first witnesses was a group of tourists from Germany currently
situated in Pag, on a promenade near hotel “Pagus”, an employee of “Hrvatske
ceste” company, and several families from the south-west of Pag, near Vodice.
Right after the first sighting, witnesses notified the C.I.M.P. (it’s a
society that observes and takes notes of strange phenomena) from Pag whose
members immediately organized a sky-observing action that lasted from 6:30
to 8:00 p.m., but without result.

<P>Unusual phenomenon was slowly ascending.

<P>At 9:30 p.m., another sighting has been reported to Radio Pag. A C.I.M.P.
member, Josip Fabijanic managed to take a photo of the UFO during the last
seconds of it’s appearance from the balcony of his house in Vodice. The
light has been of round
<BR>shape which occasionally turned into cyllindric, and it glowed in several
colors. It’s edges seemed more greenish than the inner part, which was
mostly red.It was slowly ascending and, as witnesses said later, stood
in one place for about
<BR>fifteen minutes. After that it disappeared. At 9:45 p.m., several airplanes
flew over the area. Most eyewitnesses say that there were two airplanes,
but Kresimir Fabijanic, Josip Fabijanic’s brother, says that there were
three airplanes and one helicopter.
<BR>At least one airplane came from the north (possibly from the air force
bases in Istra and on Krk), and another one from the east. The evening
was cloudy, which means that the UFO (which was double larger from the
airplane’s silhouette) was rather low.
<BR>It also excludes Venus, any other astronomical phenomena, and a weather
balloon. Weather balloons glow only when Sun shines at them in the heights.

<P>C.I.M.P. members determined that the UFO appeared at an exactly same
spot as the UFO that appeared on December 13th, 1997, and that their paths
were almost identical.

<P>Results of an official investigation are expected to be published soon.

<P>Those who have seen the phenomenon at 6 p.m. said that there were actually
two objects, completely identical and cyllindric, occasionaly round-shaped.

<P>On Wednesday, C.I.M.P. members have sent a request to several services
that regularly monitor Croatia’s night sky to see if any radar or visual
contacts have been made. After that they’ll publish their results.

<P>“Right after I found out about the UFO hovering above Pag I tried to
take a photo of it. I did it during the last seconds, when it already began
to disappear. I only managed to take one photo. However, it is a valuable
document that C.I.M.P. will continue studying.”,said Josip Fabijanic.

<P>What can I say? The fact is, this is not the only phenomenon that occurred
above Pag or in its surroundings. I’ll try to do some research during summer
(this year I’m having a holiday in Vodice) and write an article that will
cover all sightings ever recorded in that part of Croatia (I don’t know
if it’s true, but I heard that the first reported sighting dates all the
way back to 15th century).
