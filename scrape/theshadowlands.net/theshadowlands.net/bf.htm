reclusive man-like
creature inhabits the remote areas of our planet? Why not ? Isn't it
arrogant
of us to assume we know of all the species on this huge planet ?
Scientists
will tell you that we don't. Just over a decade&nbsp; ago, a unknown
animal now
named the Okapi was discovered.&nbsp;&nbsp; More recently a new ape
species was found in Sumtra.&nbsp;&nbsp; What about creatures we know
of , but
are
thought to be extinct ? The coelacanth was thought to be extinct for 70
million years until they were discovered alive and well in 1938. So is
it really that hard to believe that a hair covered, man-like creature
could
exist on the verge of discovery ? In many remote areas of the world
there
have been sightings of just such a creature. Known by many names such
as
Sasquatch, Yeti, Almas and many more. Is this an unknown primate, the
"missing
link" or some other yet unknown species ? There is evidence to support
the existence of just such a creature in the Northwestern United States
as well as other remote areas.</font></b>&nbsp;
      <p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There are still numerous
sightings every
year. The descriptions of the creatures are very similar from sighting
to sighting. There are discrepancies in some of the details but the
mind
does play tricks on us when frightened. Exaggeration and hoaxes do
account
for some of the discrepancies in the descriptions as well.&nbsp; The
height
is the most varied detail. Witnesses have reported the creatures to be
from 5'6" to 8' +. This is easily explained if you take into account
the
possible age difference of the particular creature. Did they see and
adult
or juvenile ? There would be a noticeable size difference depending on
the age.</font></b>&nbsp; <br>

      <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The photograph shown here was
taken from
a still frame of a 16mm film camera. On October 20, 1967, two men on
horseback,
Roger Patterson, who shot the film and Bob Gimlin, a friend,&nbsp; took
to the northern Californian woods of Bluff Creek in the hopes of
photographing
one of these elusive creatures.&nbsp; They were not disappointed.&nbsp;
In the late afternoon, Patterson and Gimlin encountered the
creature.&nbsp;
Patterson&#8217;s horse reared and knocked him to the ground. He quickly
jumped
up and ran toward the creature.&nbsp; It responded by simply walking
away.
Gimlin kept his friend covered with a rifle in case it attacked. It
walked
into the trees and vanished.&nbsp; The two men decided against
following
the creature thinking there maybe a confrontation with either it -or
more
of its kind that could be in the area.&nbsp; After it was filmed, many
scientists dissected the footage. Some claim the film was indeed that
of
an unknown animal. Others claim it was merely a man in an obvious
monkey
suit.&nbsp;</font></b>&nbsp; <br>
      <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Over the years, rumors abounded
that
Roger Patterson and Bob Gimlin hoaxed the whole incident. It even went
further by saying that a special effects man named John Chambers, who
designed
the makeup in the Planet of the Apes movies, designed the suit. He has
denied any involvement.&nbsp; Movie special effects people claim the
film
is just a man in a suit. Some scientists still cling to their belief
that
the film is authentic.&nbsp; Sadly, Roger Patterson died in 1972 of
cancer.
Did he go to his grave laughing? Or did he firmly believe at the time
of
his death that he had seen Bigfoot?&nbsp; In March of 1992, Bob Gimlin
admitted that he might have been fooled. He gave thought to the
possibility
that Roger concocted the whole thing and Bob was an unknowing
eyewitness
to one of the most elaborate hoaxes in the world. -

The creature

is larger than that of a man.&nbsp; They also say it would have been
very

Sasquatch&nbsp;
9-1-03</font></b></center>
      <p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">On August 26, 1957, William
Roe provided
a sworn statement about his encounter with a Bigfoot.&nbsp; Roe, who
had
worked as a hunter, trapper, and a road worker, was working in British
Columbia in 1955.&nbsp; He had hiked five miles up Mica Mountain to
explore
a deserted mine.</font></b>&nbsp; </p>
      <p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">When Roe stepped out of a
clearing,
he saw what he thought was a grizzly bear.&nbsp; When the animal stood
up, he realized this was no grizzly bear!&nbsp; The animal, a female,
was
six feet tall, three feet wide, and weighed approximately 300
lbs.&nbsp;
Her arms reached almost to her knees, and when she</font></b>&nbsp; <br>
      <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">walked she put the heel of her
foot
down first.</font></b>&nbsp; </p>
      <p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Roe was hiding in some brush
and was
able to observe the creature from a distance of some 20 feet.&nbsp; He
watched, fascinated, as she used her white, even teeth to eat leaves
from
a nearby bush.&nbsp; Her head was "higher at the back than at the
front";
her nose was flat.&nbsp; Only the area around her mouth was bare - the
rest of her body was covered in hair, none of which was longer than an
inch.&nbsp; The ears looked very much like a human's.&nbsp; The eyes
were
small and dark, similar to a bear's.</font></b>&nbsp; </p>
      <p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">At this point, the animal
caught Roe's
scent and walked back the way she had come, looking over her shoulder
as
she went.&nbsp; As she disappeared into the bush, Roe heard her make a
sound he described as "a kind of a whinny".</font></b>&nbsp; </p>
      <p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Roe wanted to find out whether
the animal
was a vegetarian or whether she consumed meat as well.&nbsp; He
searched
for and found signs (feces) in several places.&nbsp; Upon examination,
no hair or insect shells were found.&nbsp; Roe concluded this animal
lived
solely on vegetation.</font></b>&nbsp; </p>
      <p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">While Roe could not be sure
this creature
was, in fact, a Bigfoot, the logical conclusion is that he was
fortunate
enough to be able to observe this elusive creature up close.</font></b>&nbsp;

a jawbone of what he believes a whole skull would have looked like and

skull
would look like.&nbsp; There have only been a handful or teeth and
jawbones
of Gigantopithecus found throughout the world. The first tooth was

extinct for 70,000,000 years turned up in South Africa in 1938. Another
fish, completely unknown to the world, was discovered in 1976. It was
called
the megamouth shark. Other animals thought to be myth have turned up in

Most encounters
are just &#8220;being in the right &#8212; at the right time&#8221; to see a Bigfoot and
watch it disappear into the forest. However, there have been a few
documented
cases where a violent encounter with a Bigfoot has taken place.&nbsp;
One
of the most famous stories takes place in the mid 1850&#8217;s. Two hunters
were
camping in the woods. They were trappers. They made camp and headed
upstream.
Upon their return, they found their camp ransacked and large footprints
could be found, but were ignored at the time. The men repaired their
camp
and got ready for supper.</font></b>&nbsp; </p>
      <p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Later, one of the men studied
the tracks
and thought they were bear tracks, a bear walking on hind legs. His
partner
laughed but agreed that it seemed to be that way. They concluded that
no
human made those tracks.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After dark once the men were
sound asleep, one of the was awakened by the sounds of an intruder. He
saw a large figure at the entrance of their homemade lean to and he
could
smell a foul odor. He grabbed his rifle and fired. The thing ran back
to
the woods. The trappers stayed up for most of the night but there were
no further visitations.</font></b>&nbsp; </p>
      <p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">They continued setting out
traps the
next day, but stayed together. When they returned to camp. Again, it
had
been ransacked.&nbsp; More two legged footprints were found. The men
made
a large fire and took turns guarding camp. Well into the night the
thing
came back. They could hear it as it walked around the woods near the
camp
making strange growling noises but never came near their fire.</font></b>&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The next day the trappers
decided to
move on due to the events and little results from their hunting. All
morning
long they stayed together. But had the feeling something was watching
them
the whole time. They could hear twigs snapping in the woods beside
them.
One of the men, around noon, offered to finish getting the traps while
his companion went back to camp and finish packing.&nbsp;</font></b>&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">When the man returned in the
late afternoon
with the traps, he found a horrifying site. His friend lay dead. His
neck
was broken and there were four fang marks in the throat. More
footprints
were at the scene. That was it. The remaining trapper left everything
behind
except his grit He didn&#8217;t stop until he got back to civilization.</font></b>&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">A 14-year old girl reported
another
encounter that happened in the Himalayas. The creature there, referred
by the natives as a Yeti, viciously attacked the girl for no apparent
reason.
She was beaten into unconsciousness. Her brother found her soon after,
wounded, but alive. Several nearby Yaks lay dead, half eaten. The
Yeti&#8217;s
footprints were all around them. No reason whatsoever could be found
for
the unprovoked attack</font></b>&nbsp; </p>
      <p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">These kinds of attacks are
rare. Most
encounters are very brief and non- violent. They seem for the most part
gentle creatures, if you don&#8217;t include some instances of animal
mutilations
contributed to the Bigfoot. No real evidence can support this,
though.&nbsp;
But then again, it is an animal. Who knows?- adamwolf@theshadowlands.

      <br>
With summer in full swing, people are outdoors more than ever: hiking,
fishing, camping, swimming&#8230;and berry picking. It makes one wonder why
there haven&#8217;t been a few Bigfoot sightings. Well, there has been&#8230;<br>
      <br>
Last week, two Ontario women say they saw what might have been the
legendary creature in northwestern Ontario. Helen Pahpasay and her
mother were picking blueberries last Tuesday, July 22, (2008) when they
spotted a large, hulking figure from their truck at about 10 a.m. CT. <br>
      <br>
"It was black, about eight feet long and all black, and the way it
walked was upright, human-like, but more &#8212; I don't know how to describe
it &#8212; more of a husky walk, I guess," she told CBC News. <br>
      <br>
"It didn't look normal." <br>
      <br>
The Bigfoot apparently saw the women and ran into the woods, Pahpasay
said. She and her mother seriously thought about going after the
creature to try to get a better look, but were so shaken by the
experience they finally decided to abandon their berry picking
altogether and went home.<br>
      <br>
Once word got around, others returned to the area and found a large,
six-toed footprint, Pahpasay said. "What do I think it was? Right now
I'm not even sure what it was. But it really scared both of us," she
said. <br>
      <br>
"There's been talk of Bigfoot, Sasquatch. And I'm still not sure what
it was, but I've never seen anything like it." <br>
      <br>
Pahpasay also said that she and her mother aren't the only people in
the area with a Bigfoot story. There were some men from their
neighborhood that have said they too, have seen the creature a few
years ago. <br>
      <br>
"I've never believed it before, no. I'm not even quite sure what it
still is today, even after what I've seen," she said. <br>
      <br>
Many believe that Bigfoot could be roaming woods from California up the
West Coast and across Canada. <br>
      <br>
In April 2005, a ferry operator in Norway house, Manitoba, videotaped
three minutes of footage of what he said was a Bigfoot. However, the
video, which was shown on an American television, was indistinct,
failing to live up to its billing as "footage of the century." <br>
      <br>
In 2006, several people in northern Manitoba and Saskatchewan reported
seeing a Bigfoot-like figure in the woods around Flin Flon, Manitoba.<br>
      <br>
Of course, skeptics say it's ridiculous to think that a large mammal
could have evaded detection in North America throughout history.
Despite numerous alleged sightings, no one has ever produced concrete
evidence such as skulls or bones. They also say that the footprints,
film and photos can be easily faked.<br>
      <br>
Another interesting story that came out this summer is the alleged plug
of hair that was retrieved after a Bigfoot sighting. University of
Alberta professor David Coltman was recently sent the sample. (The
actual sighting was July 25, 2005). He was told that a Bigfoot was<br>
seen
and apparently realized it was being observed. It jumped and took off
running at a great speed, crashing through low hanging branches,
leaving a large sample of hair. The hair is currently being analyzed.</font></b><br>
