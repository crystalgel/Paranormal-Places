<P ALIGN=Left><B>      PHOENIX (AP) - One night in March, Sue Krzyston heard
her</B>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>husband call from outside: strange lights again in the sky.
They</B>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>had occasionally seen odd lights before from their hilltop
home in</B>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>north Phoenix, but these looked different.</B>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>      ``They were very bright, very large - amber or
orange-colored,''</B>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>she said. ``They almost looked flamelike, although it wasn't
the</B>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>shape of a flame.''</B>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>      And this night there was another difference: Mike
Krzyston had</B>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>his video camera and captured three minutes of what appeared
to be</B>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>lights hovering above the city.</B>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>      They weren't the only people who saw strange things
the night of</B>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>March 13. People from Tucson in the south to Kingman in</B>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>northwestern Arizona called authorities and groups that
track UFO</B>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>sightings to report lights, many saying they were in a
boomerang</B>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>formation.</B>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>      Radar screens showed nothing and officials dismissed
the</B>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>reports.</B>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>      But the issue won't go away quietly.</B>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>      ``You can't ignore that something happened. Something
was out</B>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>there,'' said Frances Emma Barwood, a Phoenix city
councilwoman.</B>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>      She didn't see the lights, but enough people have
called her</B>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>about them that she is convinced something happened, and
she wants</B>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>someone to investigate.</B>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>      And then the Arizona sightings hit the big time. USA
Today ran a</B>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>story on the phenomenon last week and other major media
outlets</B>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>followed. The Krzystons' videotape was played on national</B>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>television.</B>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>      Gov. Fife Symington even got into the fray, getting
headlines</B>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>during a break in his federal fraud trial on Thursday when
he said</B>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>he'd ordered a state investigation of the sightings. He
called a</B>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>news conference later to say it was all a joke, and dressed
his</B>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>chief of staff as an alien for comic effect.</B>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>      Even with the snickers, Barwood and others see the
recent</B>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>attention as vindication and proof that the phenomenon is
worthy of</B>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>investigation.</B>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>      Even if the phenomenon turns out to be manmade, Charles
Painter</B>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>would like an answer. ``Somebody knows what it was,'' he
said.</B>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>      He thinks it was Stealth bombers that he saw that
night while</B>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>driving from Tucson to Phoenix.</B>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>      ``They have to test those periodically to make sure
they don't</B>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>have any radar track,'' he said.</B>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>      Painter saw lights in a triangle formation. While
Sue Krzyston</B>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>saw several lights, Painter said he saw just three, which
appeared</B>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>much larger than the landing lights he saw on planes heading
into</B>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>Phoenix. He pulled off the highway to listen for jet engines
but</B>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>heard none.</B>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>      Sue Krzyston is quick to say she isn't claiming to
have seen a</B>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>spacecraft. But she said she and her husband had always
attributed</B>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>previous sightings of odd lights to Luke Air Force Base,
which sits</B>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>west of Phoenix.</B>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>      ``This particular night they were farther to the east
than</B>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>they'd ever been before,'' she said.</B>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>      Peter Davenport, head of the National UFO Reporting
Center, a</B>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>private organization based in Seattle, said his office
received</B>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>hundreds of calls about that night. He said the reports
were</B>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>remarkably consistent in terms of time, location and
description.</B>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>      ``Without a doubt, I think the events over Arizona
are the most</B>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>dramatic UFO sighting that has been reported to the hot
line in the</B>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>three years I've been director of the hot line in Seattle,''
he</B>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>said.</B>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>      Barwood wrote to Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., urging
him to ask</B>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>the Air Force to investigate. McCain forwarded the letter
to the</B>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>Air Force. There's been no reply.</B>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>      Whatever the cause, Barwood said people deserve an
answer.</B>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>      ``Why are so many people afraid of saying, `Hey, let's
get to</B>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>the bottom of what happened?''' she said.</B>

<H3><P ALIGN=Center>	<A NAME=2>Military Takes Blame for UFO Lights</A>
</H3><P ALIGN=Left>
<P ALIGN=Left> <B>By STEVE ELLIOTT</B>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>      PHOENIX (AP) - Military flares - rather than UFOs
- might be</B>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>behind those mysterious, bright lights that caused such
a stir in</B>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>Arizona four months ago.</B>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>      Visiting jets from the Maryland Air National Guard
were using</B>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>high-intensity flares over a bombing range near Phoenix
the night</B>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>of March 13, when many people reported seeing lights,
military</B>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>officials said Friday.</B>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>      The flares would have created quite a light show in
southwestern</B>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>Arizona, where many people reported seeing the lights in
a</B>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>boomerang formation. The lights, captured on videotape,
created a</B>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>media frenzy when the tape aired nationally last month.</B>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>      Capt. Drew Sullins, a spokesman for the Maryland Air
National</B>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>Guard, said eight of its A-10 ground-attack jets were
flying</B>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>training missions that night over the Barry M. Goldwater
Air Force</B>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>Range, 60 miles southwest of Phoenix.</B>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>      The planes were dropping high-intensity flares from
15,000 feet</B>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>to illuminate the target area, Sullins said. The flares
fall slowly</B>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>by parachute and illuminate a wide area.</B>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>      Before returning to Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in
Tucson that</B>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>night, the planes dumped all their remaining flares at
high</B>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>altitude, which would have created what one pilot called
``one hell</B>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>of a light show,'' Sullins said.</B>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>      But the flare explanation may not solve the mystery.
It doesn't</B>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>explain sightings that came from northwestern Arizona -
up to 200</B>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>miles away.</B>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>      And Frances Emma Barwood, the Phoenix city councilwoman
who's</B>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>been pushing for the Air Force to investigate the lights,
said the</B>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>explanation was just too convenient.</B>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>      ``If that is their explanation then they need to do
a</B>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>re-enactment so people can say that's what they saw or not
what</B>
<P ALIGN=Left><B>they saw,'' she said.</B>
