<br>
<big><big><big><big><big><font face="Book Antiqua"><small><small><small><small>When
I think about Robin Hood, I immediately picture Errol Flynn, or Kevin
Costner. In my minds eye I see a man green tights and a feather in his
cap, or I see a man in leather britches battling the evil Sheriff
George, played by Alan Rickman. But, seriously, who was Robin Hood? Was
he actually a historical fact or simply a medieval fiction? Why has the
Robin Hood Legend become so loved and well known across the world and
through the generations captivating audiences from young children, to
teen, men, and of course&#8230;women.</small></small></small></small></font></big></big></big></big></big><br>
<br>
<big><big><big><big><big><font face="Book Antiqua"><small><small><small><small>Most
of the knowledge concerning the Robin Hood legend derives from the
early ballads and tales which have passed through the centuries.</small></small></small></small></font></big></big></big></big></big><br>
<br>
<big><big><big><big><big><font face="Book Antiqua"><small><small><small><small>Of these, the most significant are: A Gest of Robin Hood, Robin Hood and the Monk,</small></small></small></small></font></big></big></big></big></big><br>
<big><big><big><big><big><font face="Book Antiqua"><small><small><small><small>Robin
Hood and the Potter, Robin Hood and Guy of Gisborne, Robin Hood and the
Curtal Friar, and Robin Hood's Death. All of these tales were written
down before 1550.</small></small></small></small></font></big></big></big></big></big><br>
<br>
<big><big><big><big><big><font face="Book Antiqua"><small><small><small><small>Despite
the &#8220;legend&#8221; status of Robin Hood, there are many reasons to believe
that he could have been an actual man. Many researchers have uncovered
evidence about this period in Nottingham, and points to the reality of
everyone&#8217;s favorite outlaw.</small></small></small></small></font></big></big></big></big></big><br>
<br>
<big><big><big><big><big><font face="Book Antiqua"><small><small><small><small>We
have always read that Robin Hood is a gallant hero, robbing the rich to
feed the poor and constantly fighting injustice. Everyone immediately
recognizes the names: Little John, Friar Tuck, Maid Marion, Will
Scarlett, and of course&#8230;the Sheriff of Nottingham.</small></small></small></small></font></big></big></big></big></big><br>
<br>
<big><big><big><big><big><font face="Book Antiqua"><small><small><small><small>The
legend portrays Robin as a fearless bandit, leading his &#8220;merry men,&#8221;
into victory after victory. We read that Robin was an excellent archer,
and lived his life in Sherwood Forest, poaching deer from the King.</small></small></small></small></font></big></big></big></big></big><br>
<br>
<big><big><big><big><big><font face="Book Antiqua"><small><small><small><small>Most
people don&#8217;t realize that the earliest Robin Hood tale was about a
yeoman, who haunted Barnsdale Forest, not Sherwood. Robin he didn't
become some sort of English nobleman fighting oppressors until Sir
Walter Scott added a few touches to him in Ivanhoe. The original outlaw
supposedly was a once a ragged vagrant moving from place to place,
trying to just &#8220;make it.&#8221;</small></small></small></small></font></big></big></big></big></big><br>
<br>
<big><big><big><big><big><font face="Book Antiqua"><small><small><small><small>There
is something very interesting about this story. A document of court
records was found in the London public records office dating from 1226.
It states that a man named Robert Hod fled the jurisdiction of the
king's justices, and his possessions were seized by the Sheriff of
York. (In the Middle Ages, the name Robert was synonymous with Robin.)
The document reads that this sheriff "owes 32 shilling 6 pence of
chattels of Rob Hod, fugitive." The Sheriff of York later became the
Sheriff of Nottingham. In 1227, the sheriff still owed the court the
money for Robert Hod's belongings. Eventually Hod was found and hanged.</small></small></small></small></font></big></big></big></big></big><br>
<br>
<big><big><big><big><big><font face="Book Antiqua"><small><small><small><small>Forty
years later, another fugitive was nicknamed Robyn Hod in court records.
Rolls of Parliament in 1437 show a petition for the arrest of Piers
Venables of Derbyshire who had resorted to violence and robbery and
taking refuge in the Forest.</small></small></small></small></font></big></big></big></big></big><br>
<br>
<big><big><big><big><big><font face="Book Antiqua"><small><small><small><small>Other
possibilities of the origins of Robin Hood have been tossed out as
well. The name Robin Hood could have come from the title to
Grandmasters in a witch coven, who wore hoods. The name Robin was one
of the names given to the gods they worshiped, and so the name "Robin
with a Hood" could have come about. Fairies and forest elves wore
hoods, and one fairy name was Robin Goodfellow, and so the name Robin
could have been combined with Hood in mythology.&nbsp; Others think
that forest bandits adopted the name, with Robin being a generic form
of &#8220;thief&#8217;s.&#8221; </small></small></small></small></font></big></big></big></big></big><br>
<br>
<big><big><big><big><big><font face="Book Antiqua"><small><small><small><small>Supposedly,
Little John's grave is at a church cemetery at Hathersage in
Derbyshire, as quoted from a 17th-century text about a Robert Lockesley
who met up with a Little John. The Little John grave is 13 ft. 4 in.
long, and in 1795 it was written that the grave was exhumed and the
bones were of an extremely large man. <br>

<big><big><big><big><big><font face="Book Antiqua"><small><small><small><small>There
is a grave for a &#8220;Robin Hood,&#8221; in the area of Kirklees Priory at
Yorkshire, England. The story of the epitaph is very interesting. In
1665 a drawing of the grave was made and was published in 1786, when
the words on the grave marker were no longer completely legible. The
grave read "Here lies Roberd Hude, William Goldburgh, Thomas." It is
unclear who William Goldburgh and Thomas are.&nbsp; <br>

<font color="#ffff66"><br>
<big><big><big><big><big><font face="Book Antiqua"><small><small><small><small>A
man named Thomas Gale was dean of York from 1697-1702, and he left in
his papers the words that were supposedly on Robin Hood's grave. The
date of death was recorded as 12-24-1247. A similar epitaph was
published at the end of The True Tale of Robin Hood by Martin Parker,
which gives the death date as 12-4-1198.&nbsp; The Parker epitaph
reads:&nbsp; Robert Earle of Huntington/Lies under this little
stone./No archer was like him so good;/His wildnesse named him Robbin
Hood./Full thirteene yeares, and something more,/These northerne parts
he vexed sore./Such out-lawes as he and his men/May England never know
agen&nbsp;&nbsp; </small></small></small></small></font></big></big></big></big></big><br>
<br>
<big><big><big><big><big><font face="Book Antiqua"><small><small><small><small>Researchers
have agreed on the likelihood that the man who became Robin Hood was
alive under the reign of Richard I around 1193. Most believe that this
man who was deemed an outlaw around the end of the 12th century, and
from there, the name became Robin Hood and was used to refer to other
outlaws. And so the legend grew...&nbsp; <br>
