People of Scotland and Ireland have seen the black dog for<br>
centuries.&nbsp; It should be noted that the black dog is not<br>
limited to the borders of Ireland and Scotland, as he will<br>
appear wherever there are Celtics.&nbsp; The black dog does not<br>
limit itself to those of a specific economic or social<br>
class; rather he&#8217;s an equal opportunity visitor.&nbsp; Nor is it<br>
always a purveyor of death and evil.&nbsp; Some have viewed<br>
"their" black dog to be a protector who will act as a<br>
guardian angel or guide to the after life.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
A few witnesses have described the black dog as large, as<br>
big as a calf but smaller than a Labrador dog, and shaggy.<br>
Witnesses can not agree on the size of the black dog but<br>
they all agree on two things.&nbsp; The black dog does not make a<br>
sound whatsoever and it has large fiery red eyes.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
For some, the black dog is believed to be a dangerous omen.<br>
Many believe it will hunt the guilty down until justice is<br>
done ? in one form or another. Witnesses to the black dog<br>
report an overwhelming sense of despair, are despondent and notice a severe decline in vitality making their ability to<br>
observe their surroundings or the black dog nearly<br>
impossible.&nbsp; The black dog does not exhibit aggressive<br>
behavior; rather it just follows and projects a feeling of<br>
fear and despair.&nbsp; However, there are some reports that the<br>
dog is harmless unless provoked or touched.&nbsp; Primarily it is<br>
believed to do mental harm first (despair, despondency),<br>
followed by physical harm (usually an accident of some sort<br>
because of victims lack of clarity), and end in death.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The appearance of the black dog means different things<br>
depending upon who you are and what type of life you are<br>
living.&nbsp; For the MacLartin Clan seeing the black dog means<br>
one of them will die an ignoble death on a dunghill.<br>
Far-fetched you say?&nbsp; The black dog followed Lord Jamie<br>
MacLartin one evening in 1715.&nbsp; It is reasonable to say that<br>
he was so fearful, he wasn&#8217;t being very observant to his<br>
surroundings, which enabled a group of English Dragoons to<br>
capture him.&nbsp; Lord MacLartin was robbed, hung by the neck<br>
until dead and then his body left on a nearby dunghill.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Scotland and Ireland are not the only countries to have<br>
black dogs.&nbsp; England has Shuck who is a black, fiery-eyed<br>
dog who is believed to be an apparition of evil.&nbsp; Church<br>
Grim is another black dog that guards Churchyards from evil,<br>
whether spirit or human.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The black dog is said to vanish in a brilliant burst of<br>
light.&nbsp; One farmer on Dartmoor reportedly saw a large black<br>
dog in the near distance.&nbsp; Being the friendly type, he<br>
attempted to make friends with the dog.&nbsp; The dog turned<br>
darting away. The farmer gave chase.&nbsp; At the crossroad, the<br>
dog disappeared in a brilliant explosive flash knocking the<br>
farmer to the ground.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
One night a man near Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire struck out at a black dog with two large glowing eyes.&nbsp; The dog<br>
vanished leaving the farmer speechless and paralyzed<br>
permanently.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
A waggoner on the road at Hatfield Peverell, Essex was said<br>
to encounter a large black dog that blocked his side of the<br>
country lane.&nbsp; Thinking to chase the dog out of the way, the<br>
waggoner attempted to hit the dog.&nbsp; The waggoner was found burnt
to ashes next to his abandoned horse and wagon.&nbsp; Many who have
reported seeing the black dog vanishing have returned to the spot and
found scorched marks smelling heavily of brimstone.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The Suffolk area has suffered through horrifying incidents<br>
involving the black dog.&nbsp; The following incidents have been<br>
documented.&nbsp; On August 4, 1577 the residents of Bungary and Suffolk were attending church when there was a sudden<br>
violently unusual thunderstorm that turned the sky dark and<br>
made the church quake.&nbsp; The parish clerk was cleaning the<br>
roof gutters at the time when he was struck to the ground by<br>
lightening.&nbsp; Fortunately, he was not seriously injured.<br>
Outside the lightening danced around the church illuminating the black
dog and allowing the entire congregation to see it clearly.&nbsp; The
dog ran down the aisle through the congregation.&nbsp; As it passed
through two members who were kneeling in pray they fell to the floor,
dead.&nbsp; Another man who was unfortunate to have been touched by the
dog shriveled up, yet remained alive.&nbsp; The clock mechanism of the
church was twisted and broken.&nbsp; The stones and the metal door were
marred by claw marks.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The same day, seven miles away in Blythburg another black<br>
dog was reported to have run down the aisle smiting members of the
congregation, killing two men and a young boy, and blasting others
within the church.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
In the Somerset Volume of County Folklore there is a short<br>
reference to two people who died in 1960 after having seen a<br>
black dog believed to haunt the road from St. Audries to<br>
Perry Farm.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
As I had indicated earlier, there are some that treasure<br>
their experiences with the black dog.&nbsp; In Ireland, there is<br>
the Pooka who is believed to be a good companion and guide<br>
to those who are walking the lonely dark country lanes.&nbsp; In<br>
the 1930&#8217;s in the isolated valleys of the Quantock Hills,<br>
women allowed their small children to roam the hillside.<br>
They knew their children would be protected and well looked<br>
after by the Gurt Dog (black dog).<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The next time you find yourself either walking alone on a<br>
dark stretch of road willingly or otherwise, keep your eyes<br>
focused on the road before you, cross your fingers, say a<br>
prayer, whistle and hope that the black dog doesn&#8217;t come to<br>
keep you company.</font></b><p><br>&nbsp;</p></td>
