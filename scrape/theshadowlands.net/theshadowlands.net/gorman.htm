<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">On the
first of October, 1948, lieutenant George F. Gorman was flying Mustang
F51 and was</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">about to land in Fargo, North Dakota.&nbsp;
His altitude was 1500 meters (about 4900 ft.), and when he looked down,
he saw a bright white light about a kilometer (0.62 miles) below him.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT>

<P><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">The flight control gave him permission
to land:</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">“What are you talking about?”, he said.
“You said I’m free to land, but I have a clear view</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">of the lights of an aircraft doing something
at 300 or 350 meters (1066 ft.) above ground,</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">near the runway! What should I do?”</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">“What are YOU talking about?”, they replied
with surprise. The only plane nearby was Piper</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Cub, supposed to land right after Gorman.</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Gorman watched the light hovering above
the rugby stadium near airport, and noticed that</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">there is no silhouette of the object:
the light was only light. However, he could clearly see</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">the silhouette of Piper Cub. Then, L.D.
Jensen and Manuel Johnson from the control tower</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">also noticed strange light and told Gorman
not to land until they figure out what it is.</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Gorman described the light as completely
white and of perfectly round shape, but with</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">blurred edges. When he approached it,
the light stopped, and then suddenly flew</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">to the left. Gorman immediately started
to chase it. Every time he approached the light,</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">it stopped and suddenly flew away at a
very high speeds. Gorman always did the same</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">maneuver as the light did. He chased the
light to the altitude of 4000 meters (two and a</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">half miles). Eventually, Gorman decided
to do something. He thought that, as he chased</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">the LIGHT after all, the light itself
could not damage his plane badly. But, before he could</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">do that, the light suddenly flew up and
disappeared.</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">After studying the way the light maneuvered,
Gorman estimated that it’s sure that it was</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">led by an intelligent controller. Human
or non-human, he couldn’t tell. However, he was sure</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">that laws of physics affect the light
too, ‘cause it followed the natural flight curve due to</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">inertion when it maneuvered.</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">No one knows what could the light be.
If Gorman managed to collide with maneuvering light,</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">many mysteries would probably be solved
by now. But, there is something else that is</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">weird about his encounter. The crew of
Piper Cub confirmed sighting of the light, but they</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">reported that the light disappeared way
before than Gorman; according to them, Gorman</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">chased nothing. They did see the light
at first, however. How could Gorman see the light,</FONT>
<BR><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">and they not?</FONT>
