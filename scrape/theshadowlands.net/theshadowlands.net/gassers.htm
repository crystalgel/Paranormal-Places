of 1944 in Mattoon, Illinois an unknown attacker was responsible for weird
occurrences for two weeks.</FONT></FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#000000"></FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#000000">For two weeks
during the summer of 1944 in Mattoon, Illinois an unknown attacker struck
randomly in this community.&nbsp; The first reported attack occurred on
August 31, 1944 when a resident of Mattoon woke up in the middle of the
night feeling ill and vomiting.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The resident was concerned
that the gas had been left on in the</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#000000">kitchen.&nbsp;
When he went to investigate, he found that the gas was indeed off.&nbsp;
In the meantime, across town another resident was being faced with the
same dilemma.&nbsp; A mother heard her daughter coughing and crying that
she was ill.</FONT></FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#000000"></FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#000000">September 1, 1944
around 11 PM a young housewife smelled a sickening sweet odor in her bedroom.&nbsp;
The odor began to grow until she felt herself becoming paralyzed in the
legs and lower body.&nbsp; A short while later, unaware of what was happening,
her husband came home and spotted a strange man at his wife's bedroom window.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The stranger was described as very tall and wearing dark clothes and a
tight fitting cap.</FONT></FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#000000"></FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#000000">September 5, 1944
a couple returned home from an evening out.&nbsp; They found a white cloth
near the front door.&nbsp; The woman smelled the cloth and immediately
began to feel a paralysis creeping over her body as well as feeling as
if an electric current was racing through her body.&nbsp; The police were
contacted.&nbsp; Upon their arrival, they found a skeleton key and an empty
lipstick tube container near the spot where the cloth had been found.&nbsp;
The police were unable to determine the origin of the items.&nbsp; Meanwhile,
again another mysterious incident was occurring.&nbsp; Another woman was
having gas seeping into her room leaving her feeling immobilized.</FONT></FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#000000"></FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#000000">September 10,
1944 there were two more attacks of mysterious gas involving five people.
These two attacks were dismissed by the police as nothing more than mass
hysteria. Police had begun to theorize that the odor was carbon tetrachloride
carried by the wind from a local factory.&nbsp; (Some problems with this
theory: Why was the smell just now causing a problem? Why were only select
houses and not all in a given area affected?&nbsp; Where was the pattern
to the incidents?) Needless to say, mass hysteria was not a popular theory.</FONT></FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#000000"></FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#000000">The last attack
occurred on September 13, 1944.&nbsp; A witness to this attack reported
seeing a woman dressed in mans wear spray gas through the window of a home.&nbsp;
The next morning the residents of this house, a mother and her son, found
footprints.&nbsp; The footprints were clearly high heels normally worn
by a woman.</FONT></FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#000000"></FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#000000">The police were
busy trying to explain the gas attacks as mass hysteria or the fault of
a local factory.&nbsp; What the police did not know, nor did the residents
of Mattoon was that December 1933 found similar problems in Botetourt [Bot-a-tot]
County, in Virginia.</FONT></FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#000000"></FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#000000">The first attack
in Botetourt occurred on December 22, 1933 at the first farm near Haymakertown.&nbsp;
It was reported that there were 3 separate infusions of gas into the house
where there were 9 occupants.&nbsp; The gas caused extreme nausea, headaches,
facial swelling, and for the nineteen-year-old occupant it induced convulsions
for weeks afterwards.&nbsp; The police were contacted and arrived after
the second attack but prior to the third attack.&nbsp; After the police
did a quick check and took down a report, they left.&nbsp; The third attack
came shortly after they left.</FONT></FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#000000"></FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#000000">Several victims
reported hearing voices and noises immediately prior to the gassings and
several witnesses saw men and women running away from the houses where
the attacks had occurred.&nbsp; After one attack a homeowner found women's
footsteps leading from the house to the barn but none leaving the barn!</FONT></FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#000000"></FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#000000">The Botetourt
accounts were covered locally, which is why the residents and police of
Mattoon thought their incidents were unique.</FONT></FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#000000"></FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#000000">The theory of
mass hysteria supported by the police in Mattoon does not have a lot of
evidence to support it.&nbsp; How is it possible that residents in two
different states could experience the SAME mass hysteria?</FONT></FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#000000"></FONT></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"><FONT COLOR="#000000">The attacks could
be a government experiment and cover up. Chemical warfare was beginning
to be considered.&nbsp; Also, it was close to this time period that the
alien and UFO concerns were coming to the forefront. Either of these two
possibilities could account for the gas attacks, but mass hysteria could
not.</FONT></FONT></B>
