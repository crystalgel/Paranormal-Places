On Thursday, August 31, 2000 as I was pulling out of my driveway and up
the road I saw in my rearview mirror, a strange creature peek out from
the trees and then retreat.  He was about 7-8 foot tall with a thin
snout like head.  I saw his wings which were folded downward and could
see the shoulder part pointing upward.  He was sort of a brownish gray
color.  I could not see the rest of his body because the bush and trees
hid it from me.
This section of woods is right across the street from where I live and
there are no homes there.  Also it was daylight, 8:15 am to be exact.
The creature was looking at me car and seemed to be curious.
I just thought you would be interested to know he's still around.
