<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In 1865 a giant lion's mane
jellyfish
was found in the Massachusetts Bay. The bell was 7 1/2 feet and it's
tentacles
measured 120 feet long and a width of 245 ft..&nbsp; In 1973, the
Kuranda,
collided with a giant jellyfish that was estimated to have weighed 20
tons.
The Captain of the Kuranda, Langley Smith, estimated the tentacles
length
to be over 200 ft long. With the aid of another ship, the giant
jellyfish
was forced off the front of the ship. A sample of the slime left behind
was analyzed and found to be from a lion's mane jellyfish.&nbsp; One
crew
members died during this encounter after being stung by the
creature.&nbsp;
In 1969 2 divers encountered a jellyfish that they claimed was 150 to
200
ft in diameter.&nbsp;&nbsp; There also have been reports of giant
jellyfish
attacking small boats and pursuing divers.</font></b>

<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I'm a special effects/rubber monster

<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">have some thoughts I would like to
share concerning the Lake Van/Turkey</font></b>
<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">footage.</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I actually do believe in Lake
Monsters--at
least, some of 'em.&nbsp; Nessie has</font></b>
<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">had many witnesses over the years,
and Ogopogo some very fine video footage.</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">On to to Lake Van monster,
though.&nbsp;
My background has trained me to spot</font></b>
<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">fake monsters quickly--in a sense,
I fake them professionally myself for</font></b>
<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">movies--and, although there may or
may not be something cryptozoological in</font></b>
<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">the lake, I think the Lake Van video
footage is some of the more transparent</font></b>
<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">hoaxing I've seen.</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The edited nature of the footage,
first
off, suggests that someone behind</font></b>
<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">the scenes is trying to prevent the
audience from seeing "everything" in the</font></b>
<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">scene.&nbsp; The camera appears to
be keeping away from panning left in the</font></b>
<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">moving shot--which is where a motorboat
would be if the "creature" were</font></b>
<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">being tugged on a cable/rope.</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In the stationary shot, the
exhalation
from the creature's nostrils</font></b>
<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">appears not to be respiratory
(in-and-out
or intermittent), but constant, as</font></b>
<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">you might see from an air hose.</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The moving shot itself suffers from
two major flaws:&nbsp; 1., the creature's</font></b>
<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">back never exhibits flexibility, and
is perfectly straight, as if the</font></b>
<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">creature's "detail" (ridges and
soforth)
was modeled on the upper side of a</font></b>
<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">two-by-four (in Plastic Wood, perhaps?)
which was then weighted so that it</font></b>
<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">would not float too obviously above
the surface.&nbsp; 2., it moves as though</font></b>
<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">being pulled on a cable (hence the
tight tracking of the camera on the</font></b>
<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">object, to hide the agency doing the
pulling) and does not exhibit muscular</font></b>
<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">action such as that exhibited by the
object in the Ogopogo video footage.</font></b>
<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The object in the Lake Van footage
even "lurches" suddenly, as though the</font></b>
<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">motorboat's engine had just started
up.&nbsp; I personally doubt very much that</font></b>
<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">the footage shows an animal.&nbsp;
In many cases like this, it is useful to</font></b>
<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">observe not only the behavior of the
object being photographed, but the</font></b>
<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">behavior of the camera as well.</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As a point of comparison, though,
take
a look at the Ogopogo video footage;</font></b>
<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">you will notice many subtle
flexibility's
and muscular movements as the</font></b>
<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">creature swims and dives.&nbsp; (You
will also notice far fewer cuts per minute</font></b>
<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">of screen time--so if there is a
puppeteer
under the water, they are doing a</font></b>
<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">long and convincing performance.)&nbsp;
And the fin slapping the water, to my</font></b>
<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">eye, looks absolutely like a real
animal,
and not at all like a rubber</font></b>
<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">puppet.&nbsp; Such convincing movement
would be very, very difficult to fake.&nbsp; A</font></b>
<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">rubber puppet being "motivated" by
a mechanism or by a submerged performer</font></b>
<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">would look much less spontaneous.&nbsp;
That fin belongs to a powerful</font></b>
<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">animal--and, while much has been made
of the fin and the visible "head" or</font></b>
<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"nose" in the video footage, I am much
more prone to stare at the long,</font></b>
<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">thick body trailing behind these, just
as obvious (if not more so) although</font></b>
<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">submerged.</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Hoaxes can be frustrating for the
crytozoologist,
but they do keep us on our</font></b>
<br>

spirit of fun once they are uncovered for</font></b>
<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">what they are--and there's no doubt
that, on occasion, certain hoaxes have</font></b>
<br>

interest
in mysterious creatures.</font></b>

<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In the late 1800's a dam was built
across
the outlet of Lake Leelanau in Leelanau County, Michigan, raising the
level
of the lake 10 to 12 feet and flooding quite a large amount of
land.&nbsp;
This was done to make logging in the area easier and to supply power
for
the sawmill in Leland.&nbsp; Since the lake was surrounded by swamps
and
bogs there were a lot of dead cedar stumps and smaller trees sticking
out
of the water as late as the 1960's.</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">About 1910 my great-grandfather,
William
Gauthier, then a teenager, was</font></b>
<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">perch fishing in the lake.&nbsp; Perch
tend to be a shallow-water fish which hang out in the water weeds that
have grown up in the flooded areas.&nbsp; He was in a spot that he had
never tried before, near the town of Lake Leelanau (then called
Provemont
or Carp Lake), and there were several dead cedar trees sticking out of
the water conveniently near-by.</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">He rowed close to a tree, about
5&nbsp;
feet tall and 6 inches thick, sticking out of about 6 to 7 feet of
water,
and decided to tie the boat up to it.&nbsp; As he touched the tree with
the rope two eyes opened up, just about face level, or 4 feet above the
water, and looked directly at him.&nbsp; As he told us the story he
would
pause about one second, the time the creature paused, and then say,
"Bloop,
straight down it went, and then I could see the head past the rear of
the
boat while the tail was</font></b>
<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">still in front of me" as it swam off
very quickly.&nbsp; He always admitted to being very frightened, and
that
he rowed directly home and would not go fishing on the lake for quite a
long time.</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Something interesting about his
story
is that he was one of the&nbsp; better educated children of one of the
more important families in the area.&nbsp; He told many people about it
over the years, and mentioned to my uncle that other men in the area
had
admitted over a couple of glasses of wine to having seen the creature,
but would not do so publicly.&nbsp; I would suspect that this would
have
been a solitary beast, cut off from Lake Michigan by the dam, and that
it probably died many years ago, since the area is heavily populated
now
and no recent reports of</font></b>

<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">For hundreds of years the native
people
of Vancouver Island have told legends about a mysterious sea
monster.&nbsp;
In fact, there are tales of sightings going back three hundred
years.&nbsp;
Petroglyphs even exist in which such creatures are depicted.&nbsp; Much
like the legends of the sasquatch, these tales were not taken seriously
by the European settlers.&nbsp; Not until 1937 during an incident in
whaling
station on the Queen Charlotte Islands did these legends become very
real.&nbsp;
Whalers had cut open the stomach of a recently harvested whale to
discover
a set of unique remains.&nbsp; The creature in the stomach of the whale
was around 10 ft long, it had a camellia head, a serpent like body and
fins and a tail.&nbsp; Luckily photographs of this carcass and the men
who found it have survived to this day.&nbsp; These&nbsp; photographs
remain
the definitive proof of the existence of what has been named the&nbsp;
"cadborosaurus willsi" (by scientists Paul LeBlond &amp; Ed Bousefield
who have devoted more than 20 years of study to the subject), more
commonly
known as the "caddy".&nbsp; The Cadborosaurus&nbsp; was named after a
bay
on Vancouver island called&nbsp; Cadboro Bay, near
Victoria.&nbsp;&nbsp;
To this day many people have claimed that they have seen this sea
monster.&nbsp;
Even though it is less well known than its cousin the Ogopogo who lives
in the Okanagan Lake, the sightings have been as numerous.&nbsp; In the
past four years there have been&nbsp; over 20 sightings up and down the
Coast.&nbsp; The descriptions of the Caddy</font></b>
<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">match the description of the remains
found in the whales stomach.&nbsp; They are also very close to the
descriptions
of the Ogopogo leading some people to believe that all of these animals
are members of the same family of reptilian water dwellers.&nbsp;
Perhaps
even related to the most well known of the sea monsters, Nessie..</font></b>

<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">want to discover new life there seems
to have been a movement in science away from discovery towards
explaining
the mechanisms of life we already know.&nbsp; Therefore, the caddy and
many other so-called sea monsters have not had the benefit of lots of
attention
by the scientific community.&nbsp; Leblonde and Bousfield disagree with
the lack of attention and have spent many years trying to prove that
the
caddy does exist.&nbsp; They base their findings on a wealth of
qualitative
data in the form of</font></b>
<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">eyewitness descriptions.&nbsp; The
earliest descriptions of Caddy are based on the folklore of the native
inhabitants in the area.&nbsp; The next group of sightings began as
soon
as there was a European settlement on the West Coast.&nbsp; The
earliest
recorded observation was in 1881.&nbsp; The fact that these sightings
have
even been recorded is a feat in itself considering the fact that many
people
have not wanted to talk about their experiences because of a fear of
ridicule.&nbsp;
Over the years there have been hundreds of sightings.&nbsp; (The most
recent
that I have heard about was a year ago when two pilots in a float plane
spotted the Caddy near Victoria and followed it for half and
hour.)&nbsp;
The legend of the Caddy have also been given more credence by other
physical
evidence that has washed up on shore.&nbsp; There have been carcasses
or
parts of carcasses that have caused a buzz in the field of marine
biology.&nbsp;
Although, even in the earlier mentioned case of the carcass at the
whaling
station, there has never been an overall agreement on whether the
carcasses
are in fact a new creature or an already known species by the scientific</font></b>
<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">community.&nbsp;&nbsp; Leblonde and
Bousfield instead rest their case for Caddy on the wealth of
information
that can be garnered from the eyewitness sightings over the years,
which
number in the hundreds.&nbsp; Overall, this book is an interesting and
informative</font></b>

<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Tales of sea monsters have been told
by every seafaring race since the</font></b>
<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">dawn the of man. Sometimes, these
monsters
prove real. The lungfish</font></b>
<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">could certainly fit the description
as it can upwards of 20 feet and has</font></b>
<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">a strange looking &#8216;mane&#8217; running along
most of its length. Other likely</font></b>
<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">candidates for real life serpents
include
giant squid and octopus.</font></b>
<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Scientists have now accepted the existence of giant squids,</font></b>
<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">though information about them remains
scarce. The best evidence indicates that the giant squids are cool
water,
deep sea creatures. They probably live</font></b>
<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">at depths between 1000 and 3000 feet
of depth. Like all squid, their</font></b>
<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">blood is not highly efficient at
carrying
oxygen at higher temperatures.</font></b>
<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">So they tend to live in open water
where the prevalent currents are cool</font></b>
<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">(ex. the North Atlantic current stream
towards North America). They eat</font></b>
<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">other squid, fish and in the case of
the largest, whales. This last fact</font></b>
<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">is supported by eyewitness accounts.
They are in turn eaten by sperm</font></b>
<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">whales, though this is not as common
as once thought. In fact, it</font></b>
<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">appears that often it is the squid
who will initiate attacks on the</font></b>
<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">whale. This is borne out by the
incident
involving the Brunswick. At</font></b>
<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">least three times, the squid swam
beside
and paced the ship before</font></b>
<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">suddenly turning to attack. The squid
could not grasp the metal of the</font></b>
<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">ship and died when it slipped into
the propellers. Second incident</font></b>
<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">involved a US nuclear submarine which
returned to port shortly after</font></b>
<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">launch when its sonar system failed.
At port its was found that the</font></b>
<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">rubber covering of the system had been
partially torn off and large</font></b>
<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">hooks from the tentacles of a giant
squid were found embedded in the</font></b>
<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">remainder. The giant squid then seems
a likely candidate for the origin</font></b>
<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">of the Norse tales of the Kraken, given
that it inhabits waters sailed</font></b>
<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">by the Vikings, and does on occasion
attack ships.</font></b>
<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There are also stories of giant octopi attacking ships. This is</font></b>
<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">much less likely. The existence of
the giant octopus has not yet been</font></b>
<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">accepted by science though it is
certainly
possible that they do exist.</font></b>
<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The giant pacific octopus may qualify
as a sea monster, though it is a</font></b>
<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">little small, about 9.6 meters from
arm to arm. However, if they do</font></b>
<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">exist, they will probably exhibit
behavior
similar to that of other</font></b>
<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">octopi. In this case, the giant octopus
would be a shy, retiring, bottom</font></b>
<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">dweller.&nbsp; Their main food sources
are crabs, lobsters, and detruis (dead</font></b>
<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">material scavenged from the sea bed).
They are central place foragers,</font></b>
<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">meaning that they have a home- a hiding
spot [usually] from which they</font></b>
<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">go out to search for food and to which
they return when they are</font></b>
<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">finished hunting. In this way, they
resemble many small mammals. They</font></b>
<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">have almost entirely soft bodies
allowing
them to fit through tiny</font></b>
<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">spaces to avoid predators. They can
also change color and produce the</font></b>
<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">famous ink cloud to avoid predators.
Given that they hunt on the sea bed</font></b>
<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">and usually attempt to avoid predators
(unless cornered), it seems very</font></b>
<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">unlikely that the reports of giant
octopi attacking ships are real. For</font></b>

<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Sometimes mistaken for a sea serpent
the Oarfish has mystified skin divers, ichthyologists and quickened the
heart rate of several swimmers. The fish measures between twenty and
thirty
feet long, and weighs upwards to four hundred pounds.&nbsp; Sightings
of
this rare fish are few and far between. The fish dwells at depths of
seven
hundred feet, and only comes to the surface when it is sick or injured.
It appears like a pre-historic eel, measuring four feet in
circumference,
with large saucer like eyes and a raised, red elongated dorsal fin
along
the upper ridge of its spine.</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">According to Scripps Institution of
Oceanography scientist, H.J. Walker, the fish is harmless, eating only
small shrimp off the ocean floor. He tasted a cooked Oarfish and stated
it tasted something like paper. Reports of&nbsp; a fifty- six foot
serpent
like fish was found on the shores of Scotland, it is believed to be an
oarfish. Some have speculated that this is a link to the infamous Loch
Ness Monster.*1</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Navy Seals in&nbsp; training at San
Diego, California found a twenty three foot oarfish in the bay
off&nbsp;
Coronado Island in 1996. The oarfish had washed up shore due to a
probable
collision with a boat propeller.&nbsp; In another incident, an under
water
cameraman on assignment in Nassau in 1997, photographed an oarfish in
his
own habitat. He described it as appearing silvery and reflective. Its
dorsal
fin ran the length of its back and undulated to propel it along. It had
no caudal fin as the body tapered to a point where the tail would
normally
be, and its large eyes made me think&nbsp; that I was looking at a
deep-sea
creature.*2</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In another incident a Colorado eye
surgeon
Dr. William Shachtman on vacation in a lagoon off the Baja Penninsula
snorkeled
into an eighteen foot oarfish. For his own credibility, and as luck
would
have it, he had a camera ready and was able to catch the fish on film.
Otherwise it may have been a fish story that the people back home in
Colorado
might have attributed to some other source.*3</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The oarfish is simply another
creature
that we have become aware since we as humans have made technological
advancements
allowing us to view them.&nbsp; Their survival is dependent on our care
of their habitat.</font></b>

'extinct'
right whale rediscovered</font></font></b>
<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Thursday January 15</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand's
southern right whale population, thought to have been hunted into
extinction
early last century, are "highly likely" to still be living in sheltered
waters off a remote sub-Antarctic island,</font></b>
<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">scientists said on Thursday.</font></b>
<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">DNA analysis indicates about 100 to
150 right whales that breed off the Auckland Islands, south of New
Zealand,
are the remnants of the once numerous New Zealand&nbsp; population, not
of the Australian population as previously thought. "We know that these
whales once migrated up and down the New Zealand coastline, but it has
long been thought that the whaling industry slaughtered them to
extinction,"
said Conservation Minister Nick Smith. He hailed the discovery, made by
Department of Conservation (DOC) and Auckland University researchers,
as
"tremendously exciting" for conservationists, who will be encouraged
that
the rare mammals have managed to recover from severe over-hunting. "The
reason they're called right whales is because they're slow-swimming and
coastal in their migratory patterns, and have a great deal of oil so
(they)
float when they're dead," said Michael Donoghue, a DOC marine
biologist.
"So they're exactly the 'right' whale to hunt." He said there were only
3,000 to 5,000 right whales left in the world, which is estimated to be
just five percent of their original abundance.</font></b>
<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"Between the late 1790s and about 1830,
the right whales were thought to have</font></b>
<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">gone pretty much to extinction, and
that was a generic pattern around the</font></b>
<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">southern hemisphere," Donoghue said.
"They were harvested for their oil, which basically lit the streets of
Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries." Per meter of body length, the
right
whale is the heaviest of all whales and can reach up to 60 or 70 tons
in
weight.</font></b>

<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Is there another Lake Monster hiding
in the depths of a lesser know Canada lakes?</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The lake is called Charleston,
located
between Landsdown and Lyndhurst, 30 miles north of Kingston.&nbsp; In
1897
over 100 years ago ,&nbsp; Noah Shook claimed he was pursued by a
large,
hissing creature.&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1947 three fisherman reported that
they
had seen a dinosaur type creature near a place called Tallow Bay
Rock.&nbsp;
Although the stories may seam old there is a few resent sighting, In
1994,
Mr. H while visiting his fathers final resting place, (his ashes were
placed
in the lake) saw what he described as being a large rain slick,"I had
never
seen any thing in the like that before" he said.&nbsp; Another couple
while
traveling at night in&nbsp; the summer of 1997, claimed they saw waves
that were 3 to 4 feet high, there was no wind and the water was calm
and
there were no boats in the area.</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Although&nbsp; Charlie (so dubbed by
the locals) may not be the only monster lurking in the area,&nbsp;
there
have been several reports of a Large snake like creature, living in the
murky waters of Red Horse Lake (located in Lyndhurst). This creature
has
been seen more often then Charlie.&nbsp; This Creature is said to be
greenish
black, a head like a horse with small breathing tubes on its head and
it
about 60 to 80 feet long.</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Fisherman have seen its black body
emerge
from the waters and&nbsp; in mid 1970s one woman who wishes to remain
anonymous,
was leaning over her small row boat in order to grab a bullfrog for her
pond when the monster she said "just popped its head right out of the
water
and looked at me!" The woman screamed from fright and the creature was
so long it created foaming bubbles while trying to dive beneath the
water.&nbsp;
The woman decided to leave the bullfrog alone.</font></b>
<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Location of that was a place called
Cold Spring Bay, a beautiful spot with a natural spring flowing from
the
rocks.&nbsp; I have also hear of one in the late 1800s of a boy about
10
maybe 12 went down to a large field near the waters edge, to bring his
family cow up for the nightly milking. When he reached the field he
immediately
seen a large serpent like creature laying half in and half out of the
water,
"It was bigger round then a stove pipe" he said.&nbsp; The boy watched
as the serpent began swallowing a young calf, whole.&nbsp; He ran back
to his house and told his father what had happened, and begged for his
father to come and look, not knowing what to make of the ordeal, his
father
took a riffle, and hurried down to the waters edge, the monstrous snake
had gone, but had left a trail as deep as a small ditch, and one of the
calves were missing.</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Needless to say I am surrounded by
large
bodies of water that&nbsp; could harvest some incredible creatures,
although
they have been some large fish caught in these areas such as pike
weighing
40-50 lb. and Muskie 50-65lbs. one Muskie (the one that got away) was
estimated
as weighing as much as 95lbs and one reportedly scooped up a woman's
small
poodle while she was bathing it.&nbsp; The Lakes are deep and dark, in
Ontario, Canada and my question is this...Do we really know what swims
in our own Lakes and Rivers?</font></b>

a body of an unknown creature was found decaying near the shore on one
of the islands of Masbate here in the Philippines. At first they

it was a decaying cow but later found out it was not. The local folks
who

it as somewhat black or dark in color, has four fins and a long tail.

million
to 1 million years ago.&nbsp; This gigantic shark is estimated to have
measured 40 to 60 ft long.&nbsp; The average length of a great white
shark
is 15 ft and it's rare to see one near 20 ft long.&nbsp; The megalodon
was thought to be long extinct.&nbsp; Two teeth of this shark have been
dated are are said to be only 24,000 and 11,000 years old.&nbsp;&nbsp;
11,000 years is a short period of time when compared to the millions of
years the animal was known to be alive, so it still could be possible
that
the species has survived to modern times.&nbsp; There have been a few
sightings
of giant sharks resembling the great white over the years.&nbsp; In
1918,
some crayfish fisher man reported a shark that was about 115 ft long
ate
their bait.&nbsp; While they may have exaggerated the length, cutting
their
estimate in half still gives you a great white shark more than 2 times
their normal length.&nbsp;&nbsp; They were also familiar with the local
sea life and the great white shark so it's unlikely they confused
species.&nbsp;&nbsp;
There is also a few theories on how such a large shark could remain
hidden
all this time.&nbsp; Many cryptozoologists believe that the megalodon
spends
much of is time in very deep waters, perhaps feeding on giant squid
like
the sperm whale does.</font></font></b>

<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="+2">The Gloucester Sea
Serpent</font></font></b></p>
</center>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In August of 1817 an unknown marine
creature created a sensation when it visited the harbor in Gloucester,
Massachusetts nearly every day for a month. Witnesses (among them
fishermen,
clergy, statesmen and housewives) described the 80 to 100 foot long
creature,
which they believed to be a sea serpent, as resembling a &#8220;row of casks&#8221;
or the &#8220;buoys of a seine&#8221;.&nbsp; All agreed on one thing - they&#8217;d never
seen anything like it before.</font></b>
<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The intense interest in the creature
by the New England Linnaean Society during the summer of 1817 and the
newspaper
coverage of its return (and alleged capture) in 1818, along with
additional
eyewitness accounts, especially from Nahant in 1819 and Rockport in
1886,
make it perhaps the world&#8217;s best documented sea serpent.</font></b>
<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;Dr. Antoon Oudemans considered
the Gloucester reports authentic and included them in his book The
Great
Sea-Serpent (London 1892).&nbsp; Commander Rupert Gould devoted
forty-three
pages to the New England Sea Serpent in his The Case for Sea-Serpents
(Phillip
Allen 1930).&nbsp; Bernard Heuvelmans uncovered additional reports of
the
creatures (it stands to reason that reports dating from 1638 to 1960
cannot
all have been a single animal) which he dubbed Plurigibbosus
novae-angliae
(that-with-many-humps-of-New England) in his book In the Wake of the
Sea-Serpents
(Hill &amp; Wang 1965).&nbsp; And in his Monsters of the Sea (Knopf
1994)
Richard Ellis concluded that it was &#8220;One of the great unsolved
mysteries
of sea serpent lore.&#8221;&nbsp; But the unknown creature which has come to
be known as the Gloucester Sea Serpent did not confine itself to the
waters
off Cape Ann.</font></b>
<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Reports from the Canadian Maritime
Provinces and the coasts of Maine, Massachusetts, Connecticut and
Maryland
indicate that the creature(s) made regular seasonal appearances
throughout
the north Atlantic as recently as the 1960s, (and possibly since)
apparently
following their preferred prey (herring and mackerel) to the Grand
Banks
- until recently one of the richest fishing grounds in the world.</font></b>
<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In spite of being well documented in
sworn statements, numerous newspaper and magazine articles and in&nbsp;
Oudemans&#8217;, Gould&#8217;s and Heuvelmans&#8217; books, the New England Sea Serpent
remains
virtually unknown among the general public. That may change in the
summer
of 1999 when Down East Books publishes the first ever book-length
account
devoted solely to this elusive and intriguing marine mystery.</font></b>
<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Building on the material compiled by
the above authors and incorporating some of the prodigious research of
cryptozoologist Gary S. Mangiacopra, along with dozens of &#8220;forgotten&#8221;
newspaper
reports from a scrapbook in the Cape Ann Historical Association
archives,
author J.P. O&#8217;Neill has assembled an historical account of The Great
New
England Sea Serpent that will make it far harder to dismiss as a &#8220;fish
story&#8221;, a hoax or a mass hallucination. The people who live by, and of,
the sea in New England have been seeing something strange in the water
for three hundred years, and whatever it is, or was, they called it a
Sea
Serpent.</font></b>

<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">On the shore of Crescent Lake in
Central
Newfoundland you will find the small fishing community of Robert&#8217;s Arm,
home of the Cressiteras angulloida (crescent eel-like marvel),
affectionately
known to the locals as &#8220;Cressie&#8221;.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Evidence of an unknown inhabitant of
the lake can be traced to ancient native legends in which references to
the woodum haoot, (pond devil), or haoot tuwedyee (swimming
demon).&nbsp;
The lake and surrounding ponds are famous for their population
abnormally
large Anguilloidei or fresh water eel population, which some
unfortunate
RCMP rescue divers had the dubious pleasure of encountering on two such
dives.&nbsp; The first of which in the early 80&#8217;s when they were called
upon to investigate a large hole punched in the mid-winter ice
originally
thought to be a snowmobile accident, however the dive turned up
nothing.&nbsp;
Several years later other divers trying to recover a body from a downed
plane encountered some over-friendly eels the size of a man&#8217;s
thigh.&nbsp;
The diver&#8217;s were attacked by the eels who apparently were tired of
their
usual surf dinners and decided to try some turf.&nbsp; The divers
returned
to the surface shaken from their ordeal.</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Many sightings of &#8220;Cressie&#8221; have
persisted
over the years, yet there are no known photos of her at this
time.&nbsp;
All the descriptions of the monster from first hand accounts are
remarkably
similar; black, serpent shaped, eel like in appearance.&nbsp; However,
some disparity in length is prevalent (5ft up to 25 ft) leading most to
believe that perhaps there is a family of &#8220;Cressies&#8221; living within the
confines of the lake.</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Next month the author of this report
will be traveling to Robert&#8217;s Arm to investigate the Crescent Lake
Monster
first hand.&nbsp; I hope to be able to provide interviews of witnesses,
photographs of the Crescent Lake and South Pond areas, the ecology and
geological history of the lake.</font></b>

<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In Lake Seljordsvatnet located in
Telemark,
Norway there is a creature known to the locals as Selma.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Selma
is described as a long snake like animal that is approximately 30 ft
long.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The first sighting of Selma dates back to 1750 when an attack on a
small
boat was attributed to the creature.&nbsp; The creature was sighted
numerous
times during the 1800 with the high point being an incident in 1880
when
a woman reportedly cut the creature in half and the rear half returned
to the water.&nbsp;&nbsp; The local left the front dead half on the
beach
to rot away and no samples were taken.&nbsp; Since 1750, there have
been
over 100 sightings of the creature up to and including the year
2000.&nbsp;&nbsp;

</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">(CNN) -- From creatures of the deep
to massive mountain monsters, legends of shy prehistoric forms of
wildlife
persist throughout European culture and history.</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The legend of Scotland's Loch Ness
monster
is easily the most popular and enduring.</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">But now Norway has a rival to the
famed
creature -- "Selma," a fabled serpent which has caught the attention of
an international team of monster hunters.</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">A giant trap for catching the
creature,
reputed to be a cousin of the Loch Ness monster, has been set up in a
lake
in south Norway.</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The 18-foot (6m) long tube-shaped
trap,
comprising a metal frame with nylon netting, is set to be lowered into
Seljord lake in south Norway and will contain live fish for bait to
catch
"Selma."</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Over the next two weeks, the team,
which
comprises seven Swedes, three Norwegians, a Canadian and a Belgian,
will
dangle the cage in the lake, about 110 miles (170 km) southwest of
Oslo,
at depths of up to 300-feet (91m) near where sightings of the monster
have
been reported.</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Reports of a beast in the lake first
surfaced around 1750, and most accounts agree it looks like a serpent
with
the head of an elk or a horse.</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">But despite perpetual reports of
sightings,
claimed photographs of the monsters and a number of attempts to
scientifically
prove their existence, the mysteries of Loch Ness and Selma remain just
that.</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In the case of the Loch Ness
monster,
the legend grows ever larger and more popular among the local community
-- particularly because of the tourism it generates.</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Whether it is that factor or similar
enduring folklore, lake creatures are also becoming more regularly
spotted
throughout Europe.</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The latest attempt to catch Nessie's
Norwegian cousin follows other sightings in Scandinavian countries.
Swedish
monster spotters have been kept busy in recent years with a rush of
stories
about a similar strain of serpent.</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Five years ago, a new legend was
born
in Lake Van, Turkey. Authorities recorded witness accounts of a
monster-like
dinosaur in the country's largest lake.</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In 1997, pictures claimed to be of
the
reclusive lake snake were sent to England's Cambridge University and to
renowned marine biologist Jacques Cousteau for analysis amid
accusations
of a bid by the nearby community to attract more tourists to the region.</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Across the Atlantic, Canada has its
own version of the mystery, the Ogopogo.</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">But it is not only slippery serpents
that capture the imagination of monster spotters.</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Yeti, a hairy, oversized,
man-like
beast, is said to live in mountain ranges in Europe -- particularly the
Caucasus range.</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Russia has recorded more than 1,000
sightings of the Yeti and, according to London's Daily Telegraph
newspaper,
several dozen scientists gathered in Moscow in 1997 to talk through
reported
evidence of the monster, also known as the Abominable Snowman.</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Claims of sightings of the Yeti are
also common in Asia. In North America, a similar creature, the
Sasquatch
or "Big Foot" is part of common folklore.</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Sightings and claims of proof of
inexplicable
beings are most frequent in the United States. There, expanding
archives
of films, photographs and now Web sites attempt to prove the existence
of an array of fantastic wildlife.</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">But perhaps a lesson to nonbelievers
comes from the South Pacific, where a giant race of squid, mythologized
for centuries, turned out to be real.</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">After remaining elusive for many
years,
more and more of the creatures, some measuring more than 60 feet long,
are being caught by fishermen off Australia and New Zeland.</font></b>

<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">SELJORD, Norway -- Last year
scientists
recorded what the Oceanographic Institute of Bergen called "an unknown
sound of a mammal." This year they're back, trying to catch a mythical
monster they have named "Selma."</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">For the third time the expedition
team
GUST 2000 is searching for the creature in the Seljordsvatnet, near
Seljord,
a town whose coat of arms features a sea serpent.</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">They have returned with sonar and a
specially designed serpent-trap. The trap is a labyrinth net, designed
to catch a sea serpent baby.</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In addition to the team with a trap
and sonar, a second team is being placed up in the mountains in case
Selma
decides to make a sudden appearance on the surface.</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In addition, a third team is diving,
shooting underwater pictures and searching the bottom.</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">GUST 2000 members are also
interviewing
locals to get a picture of what Selma might look like should she
appear.
The common view seems to be that she has big black eyes, a head like a
horse without ears, is black all over, and has a considerably thicker
middle
region that includes flippers. Locals suggest her length is between 3
and
12 meters (10 and 40 feet).</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The serpent has been part of local
folklore
since the first "documented" sighting in 1750. There are some villagers
who don't believe in Selma, but plenty of locals do think there is
something
in the lake.</font></b>
<br>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Scientists are using this labyrinth
net to try and catch a baby serpent</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Whether Selma is a monster eel, a
sea
serpent or just a flow of dark water, Jan Sundberg and his team believe
that Selma exists in some form, and that she might be living with
others
of her kind.</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"We're trying to catch a little
baby,
because we think there is a whole family here. It's a long shot, but
we're
trying," Sundberg said.</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">If they do manage to catch her, then
a team of two biologists will come and take samples and her DNA.</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Somehow one thinks that life will
never
be the same for this little Norwegian village if Selma turns out to be
a reality. And if they can't find her, true believers will be no doubt
be unfazed.</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"Of course there's something in the
lake," says one local resident. "It's something, but I don't know what.
I've seen it myself."</font></b>

<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">That 19th century tale of adventure
on the high seas is about to be challenged by a 21st century adventure
beneath them, when the son of a legend sets sail from Port Moresby to
chase
the shadow of a myth.&nbsp; The son of a legend is 61-year-old
Jean-Michel
Cousteau, who is due to leave Port Moresby on October 1 on an
expedition
which would do his late famous father, Jacques, proud. The myth
Cousteau
is chasing is the "kraken", a giant squid with eyes&nbsp; the size of
soccer
balls, a beak which can tear through bone and wood and a reputation
almost
as big as its one-tonne, tentacled frame.&nbsp; Moby Dick author Herman
Melville immortalised the mysterious creature when he wrote about a
duel-to-the-death
between a squid and a sperm whale in his 1851 classic.&nbsp; In
reality,
little is known about the world's largest invertebrate.&nbsp; Although
carcasses have been found tangled in fishing nets, washed up on various
beaches and half-digested in the stomachs of sperm whales the only
known
predator of the squid it has never been seen alive.&nbsp; That is
because
the giant squid, dubbed the "kraken" by the ancient Greeks, spends most
of its life in cold darkness thousands of metres beneath the ocean
waves.&nbsp;
But that was before Deep Ocean Odyssey, the adventure-exploration
company
co-founded by Cousteau, sponsored the development of the Deep Rover, a
revolutionary, clear bubble of a craft which its designers say can dive
deeper, stay down longer, and manoeuvre more freely than any other
conventional
submarine.&nbsp; Deep Ocean Odyssey now has two Deep Rovers, worth more
than a $1 million each, ready to carry its scientists and cameraman
deep
into the Kaikoura Canyon off the east coast of New Zealand in pursuit
of
what the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cousteau-led team calls the
"giant
calamari".&nbsp;&nbsp; Teeming with marine life, Kaikoura is known to
be
a veritable McDonald's drive-through for pods of sperm whales
presumably
hunting giant squid.&nbsp; The Cousteau team plans to follow the sperm
whales 650m into the canyon, where they will load up the Deep Rover's
arms
with fresh bait, switch off their engines and lights and simply
wait.&nbsp;
No one is sure what will happen if and when a squid fixes its dinner
plate-sized
eye on two human beings sitting in a transparent bubble.&nbsp; What is
known is that it can move at lightning speed, has the ability to change
colours in the blink of an eye and judging by the wounds left on the
carcasses
of whales it has bested in hostile encounters has remarkable strength
in
its eight arms, all of which are lined with toothed
suckers.&nbsp;&nbsp;
"I'm not sure I want to be in a sub if he takes it and decides to keep
it as a toy," Cousteau confessed wryly at a media briefing in New York.</font></b>

</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"The monster slowly drew in toward
shore
and as it approached, its head poured out a stream of water that looked
like blue flame."</font></b>
<br>

the creature as 150 feet long and thirty feet in circumference. He
confided,
"Its shape was somewhat out of the ordinary insofar that the body was

body.</font></b>

the electrically charged atmosphere birds and insects died. Two of my
fellow
fisherman became paralyzed when licked by the blue flame. They lay on
the

the
Pacific Northwest</font></font></center>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Pacific Northwest stands in
sharp
contrast to other parts of the American West. There are no cactuses or
parched deserts in this land of rain and fog, towering forests and
meandering
fjords. When Lewis and Clark wintered near the mouth of the Columbia
River
in 1805, their foremost concern was to keep dry. They noted in their
diary
on Boxing Day, 1805, "...a continuation of rain, accompanied by
thunder,
and a high wind from the southeast. We were therefore obliged to stay
in
our huts and endeavored to dry out wet articles before the fire."</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Water plays an all encompassing role
in the Pacific Northwest and it is not surprising to find that its
coastal
seas and wet forests continue to this day to hide unresolved mysteries.</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The economy of coastal tribes of the
area has long rested on the rich bounty of sea and forest. Abundant
resources
have left leisure time for artistic creation, and native peoples have
left
an artistic legacy of the region's creatures. ne sea life, in
particular
sea otters with their lustrous pelts, drew English, Spanish, Americas,
and Russian fur traders in keen competition for the resources of the
region.</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">European and eastem North American
explorers
marveled at the rich sea life, many species of whales, playful otters,
seals, and birds. They soon heard from the Indians about other, rarely
seen creatures that vied with orcas for strength and speed and
occasionally
even ventured on land.</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Manhousat people along the west
coast of Vancouver Island, for example, spoke of the hiyitl'iik, or sea
serpent, a semilegendary creature.' This animal was seven or eight feet
long, moved quickly on land as well as on water, and could grow wings
at
will. It was very rarely seen.</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Sea serpents remain a persistent and
unsolved Pacific Northwest mystery. Reports continue to trickle in of
sightings
of large, unknown marine animals in coastal waters and some large
inland
lakes. Despite wide public interest in such mysterious creatures,
scientists
hesitate to draw conclusions or even involve themselves in the search.
Observations of sea monsters are sparse and fleet- ing, and many
scholars
would rather dismiss them than seek a rational explanation.</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Questions regarding the existence
and
nature of mysterious, undiscovered animals do, however, attract some
scientific
attention. Crypto zoology, a term coined by scientist Bernard
Heuvelmans
that derives from the Greek cryptos (hidden) and zoology (the lore of
animals),
describes the activity of those (crypto zoologists) who apply
scientific
methods to the study of hidden animals, or cryptids.1 Crypto zoology
remains
on the margin of the scientific mainstream.</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The time has passed when the
discovery
of new animals motivated zoological research. There may yet exist
animals
unknown to science, and some of them might occasionally be glimpsed, in
Scotland's Loch Ness, for example, and elsewhere. Concern about the
existence
of such crypteds now attracts mostly amateurs and hobbyists.
Classically
trained French zoologist Heuvelmans is a rare exception: A professional
who has devoted his scientific life to the exploration of this
challenging
topic, scouring old manuscripts and virgin forests for evidence and
writing
extensively on the subject.</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The International Society of Crypto
zoology, with offices in Tucson, Arizona, and presided over by
Heuvelmans,
serves, through its publications and meetings, as a focus for
approximately
one thousand members, divided about equally between curious amateurs
and
equally curious scientists from many disciplines.</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">News of the existence of marine
crypteds
in the Pacific Northwest first arose from native legends, and designs
on
native crafts have preserved their likenesses. The Skagit River atlatl
is one of the best known and most solidly authenticated of the
prehistoric
Northwest Coast artifacts. The yew wood spear-thrower, now in the
collection
of the Museum of Anthropology, University of British Columbia, is
crowned
by a carving of a rampant sea monster with white inlaid eyes. The
artifact
was dredged near the mouth of the Skagit River, and carbon-14 dating
has
shown that the atlatl was carved circa AD 200.</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Depictions of sea serpents also are
common in native petro glyphs seen along the coast of the Pacific
Northwest.
A creature in one of the petro glyphs at the Monsell site near the
Nanaimo
River on Vancouver Island, bears some resemblance to the sea monster
carved
on the atlatl.</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Reports by European eyewitnesses
support
the native legends, drawings, and pictographs. A classic early sighting
and description by nonnatives of a sea serpent was that of prospector
Osmond
Fergusson and his partner, identified only as Walker, in the Queen
Charlotte
Islands in January 1897. "I saw ahead of us what I thought was a piece
of driftwood," Fergusson wrote,</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"On getting closer I noticed it was
moving towards us. When within 50 yards I said to Walker, What is that?
What we could see was,an object sticking out of the water about two
feet.
When within a few feet of it the end uncoiled &amp; raised a long neck
out of the water with a head like a snake on it."</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">When the animal submerged and passed
near them, Fergusson wrote, they "could see a body 25 feet long
tapering
with a fish like tail."'</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Others spotted similar long-necked
creatures.
One Sunday in September 1905, Philip Welch and a friend were fishing
for
trout in Johnstone Strait off northern Vancouver Island. In 1970 he
wrote
that on that day sixty-five years earlier, an enormous salmon run at
the
mouth of the Adams River made it impossible to catch trout.</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Although it was only 9 A.M., the
disappointed
fishermen were re- signed to returning home when they saw a long neck
appear
some two hundred yards astern their boat. The animal submerged.
Alarmed,
they rowed for shore as quickly as they could, hitting salmon with
their
oars at every stroke. The creature reappeared about one hundred feet
astern.
It was gaining on them when once more it submerged, and they did not
see
it again.</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The animal, Welch wrote, had a long
neck, six to eight feet of which protruded above the water. The neck,
about
the size of a stove pipe, tapered from a twenty-inch diameter to about
ten inches at the head, which looked somewhat like the head of a
giraffe.
'Me creature looked up and down Johnstone Strait, turning its head this
way and that, giving the men a good view of it. Welch noticed two bumps
on the head, about five inches high and rounded on top. Nostrils were
plainly
visible but eyes were hard to detect.</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">No mane or hair of any sort were
visible.
The animal was brown in color. Welch's report did not include a sketch;
his description of the animal, however, resembles a creature observed
many
years later on the Oregon coast.</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Although stories of sea serpents
continued
to appear in the press and to attract public interest through the early
years of this century, many scientists refused to take the evidence
seriously.'
The views expressed by David Starr Jordan, the first president of
Stanford
University and a prominent zoologist and ichthyologist, were widely
shared.
Commenting in 1893 on a sea serpent sighting in the North Atlantic,
Jordan
insisted that</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">the sea-serpent is a myth. It does
not
receive the attention of scientific men because they have real things
to
attend to. If people were not telling marvelous tales of the
sea-serpent,
they would find something else to tell marvelous tales about and
somebody
to believe them.</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Turn-of-the-century scientists were
too busy with more readily verifiable phenomena to pay attention to
fleeting
eyewitness reports of hypothetical creatures. Observers, often
subjected
to ridicule were hesitant to disclose findings. For many years, the
cultural
climate was not favorable for the reporting of sea serpents.</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This changed, however, after 1933
when
the British press began to pay serious attention to reports of a large
"monster" in Scotland's Loch Ness, beginning with a sighting by John
Mackay
in April of that year. Mackay was the innkeeper in Drumnadrochit on the
north side of Loch Ness.</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">He and his wife were returning from
Inverness along the recently opened north-side road when they spotted a
giant creature in the Loch. Their report in the Inverness Courier
started
the interest in a Loch Ness "monster."</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Exactly one year later Lieutenant
Colonel
R- K. Wilson, a British army surgeon, captured Nessie on film while he
was grouse hunting near Loch Ness. By the time Wilson took his
photograph
in April 1934, Fleet Street journalists had transformed "Nessie" into
an
international celebrity. Following the example of the British press,
the
former colonies assumed a similar interest in sea monster sightings.</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Major W. H. Langley, clerk to the
British
Columbia legislature, announced to a receptive audience that on Sunday,
October 1, 1933, while sailing near Chatham Island, just east of
Victoria,
he and his wife had heard a very loud noise, "something between a grunt
and a snort accompanied by a huge hiss. We both saw a huge object about
90 to 100 feet off ... and on the edge of the ke p just off the Chatman
Island shore," he told the Victoria Daily Times. "It was every bit as
big
as the back of a large whale, but entirely different in many respects.
Its color was of a greenish brown. ... It had markings along the top
and
sides. They seemed to be of a serrated nature."</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The animal was visible for only a
few
seconds before it dived quickly, and they saw it resurface in the
distance.</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Encouraged by Langley's report, F.
W.
Kemp, an officer of the Provincial Archives of British Columbia,
revealed
that he and his family also had seen a strange animal in the same area
the previous summer. On August 10, 1932, they had observed a "huge
creature
with head out of the water travelling about four miles per hour against
the tide." Kemp reported that the creature,</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">swimming to the steep rocks of the
island
opposite ... shot its head out of the water on to the rock, and moving
its head from side to side, appeared to be taking its bearings. nen
fold
after fold of its body came to the surface. Towards the tail it
appeared
serrated with something moving flail-like at the extreme end.... Around
the head appeared a sort of mane, which drifted round the body like
kelp."</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Kemp and his family came back the
next
day and measured logs on the beach against which they had compared the
creature. One log was more than sixty feet in length. The Kemps also
drew
a picture, which tallied with Langley's description (Figure 3).</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Archie Wills, news editor of the
Victoria
Daily Times, gradually developed an active interest in the strange
creature.
He soon had a dozen letters from people who said they, too, had seen
the
sea serpent but had refrained from talking about it for fear of
ridicule.</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Wills organized a contest to name
the
animal, which was dubbed "Cadborosaurus," after Cadboro Bay near
Victoria,
where it had been repeatedly sighted. The name was soon abbreviated to
"Caddy," a more. manageable form under which later sightings were
reported.
Since then, about fifty sightings of Caddy at close range have been
reported
by eyewitnesses in the protected waters of the Puget Sound-Strait of
Georgia
system, as well as on the outer coast from Oregon to Alaska . From
among
the fifty reports a sampling is noted here to suggest the nature of the
evidence.</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Mrs. E. Stout of Klamath Falls,
Oregon;
her sister-in-law Mrs. Fred Parson; and their two small sons, ages four
and five, were walking along sandy Dungeness Spit, watching ships
travel
in and out of Juan de Fuca Strait. It was the middle of March 1953, and
the weather was overcast and drizzly, as it so often is on the coast
during
winter months. They were watching a large freighter, about a quarter of
a mile offshore, moving eastward toward Port Townsend, when they saw
what
appeared to be a tree limb. Mrs. Stout wrote that the object
disappeared
abruptly beneath the surface and in a few seconds appeared again, much
closer. The two women made out the form of a creature and distinctly
saw
a large, flattish head turned</font></b>
<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">away from them and toward the ship.
Mrs. Stout continued:</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"I think all of us gasped and
pointed.
We could distinctly see three humps behind the long neck. 'Me animal
was
proceeding westward and at an angle toward us. It sank abruptly again
and
reappeared closer, almost due north of us. In the dim light, we could
distinctly
make out color and pattern, a long floppy mane, and the shape of the
head....
We estimated that the length of the exposed neck was at least 6 ft. and
the head probably at least twenty inches long.</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"As a trained biologist, I simply
could
not accept that long floppy mane or fin. Yet, we all saw it. It was a
limply
hanging thing. We deduced that the humps were at least five feet.
Again,
I simply could not accept their arrangement. They were close together
with
no visible curve .... The animal was rich deep brown with large
reticulations
of a bright, burnt orange. The pattern wasn't unlike that of a giraffe
except much larger. ne fin appeared to be drab or colorless.</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"We could see no body movements,
except
that the neck lowered and moved backward with grace and the head
swivelled,
raised and lowered. Its forward progression was smooth, like a swan's.
It sank and rose almost perpendicularly; although there was no
indication
of effort, it progressed westward, toward Pt. Angeles at a fair rate of
speed. The whole episode lasted about eight minutes."</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Another close-range sighting, which
clearly involved an unidentified creature, was reported by David Miller
and Alfred Webb, two fishermen from Victoria. The observation occurred
in midafternoon in late November 1969 about one-half mile off the
Discovery
Island Lighthouse in eastern Juan de Fuca Strait. Miller wrote:</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"I observed this strange creature
surface
roughly 80 ft. on our port beam. It started to move rapidly away from
us
so we speeded the engine up and gave chase. We got within 30 ft. when
it
suddenly submerged, not in the method seals or sea-lions do but as
though
something pulled it under. A few moments later we arrived at its place
of submergence and there was a tremendous turbulence, suggesting a
creature
the size of a 30 ft. sea whale.</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"Its speed under water was also
astounding
as it surfaced a few minutes later over a hundred yards away. It stayed
up while we took after it again but this time it never let us close
again.
ne first encounter was so close that both of us remarked about its
large
red eyes and short ears visible at that range .</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">He included a sketch with his report
and emphasized that of all the many kinds of marine creatures he had
seen
in his years at sea, none looked even remotely like that one. Marine
crypteds
seen along the outer Pacific Coast include one reported in 1934 by L A
I-arson, first mate on the Columbia River lightship. The animal, later
described for the press as "Colossal Claude," was "about 40 feet long,"
Larson said.</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"It had a neck some eight feet long,
a big round body, a mean looking tail and an evil, snaky look to its
head."
Claude broke into the news again in 1937 when Charles E. Graham,
skipper
of the troller Viv, reported sighting a "long, hairy, tan-colored
creature,
with the head of an overgrown horse, about 40 feet long, and with a
4-ft.
waist measure."</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">One of the best documented West
Coast
sightings occurred around New Year's Day 1937 about two miles south of
Yachts, Oregon, just south of Cape Perpetua near a chasm in the rocky
shoreline
known as the Devil's Churn." The weather was stormy and the sea very
rough.
The witnesses, a couple who insisted that their names be kept
confidential
to avoid ridicule, were sitting on a landing about thirty feet above
the
sea along the switchback trail that leads from the parking area near
the
highway to the Churn.</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">They were watching the spectacular
breakers
when they saw the creature about two hundred feet due west of the mouth
of the Churn. It came directly toward the Churn, swimming slowly
without
any visible propelling motions and stopped for fifteen to twenty
seconds
close to the entrance of the chasm, about one hundred feet from the
observers.</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The couple remarked that "the heavy
breakers did not seem to toss it around one bit." A truck came by on
the
highway during that time, and the animal turned its head to look at it,
then looked back at the witnesses, then again at the truck.</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Afterwards, it swam south along the
coast, moving rapidly at a speed the man estimated to be twenty-five
knots.</font></b>
<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The two witnesses followed the animal
along the shore highway in their car. At an observation point about a
mile
south of the Churn, they saw it veer off from the coast and swim out to
sea.</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The couple sketched the creature
showing
a neck, approximately fifteen feet long, surmounted by a head described
by one witness as like that of a horse or camel and by the other as
similar
to a giraffe's head. One witness observed small, "incessantly
fluffering"
ears while the other did not notice the ears but thought that the
animal
had I small, straight horns on its head, eight to ten inches high and
the
size of a small water pipe. A mane the color of seaweed was visible
along
the neck all the way down to the body. The body itself was about six
feet
across, the "size of a steam boiler," although not rounded, with a
ridge
along the back.</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">About three feet of the body emerged
above the water surface. While the animal was in a low wave trough
after
a breaker had passed, one of the witnesses, who observed a tail as long
as the rest of the body, estimated the total length of the animal to be
fifty-five feet.</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Are such stories true? Have people
seen
sea serpents or merely glimpsed real and elusive animals yet unknown to
science? Or are their reports akin to the sensational offerings of
tabloids?
Logic suggests three possibilities:</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">(1) Witnesses were lying;</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">(2) they were honest but deluded; or</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">(3) they actually observed what they
described.</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The veracity of witnesses is not
readily
testable. Undoubtedly some hoaxes have been reported.</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Nevertheless, the surprise and
disbelief
expressed by many people at what they have seen, plus the reluctance of
several individuals to speak of their experience for fear of being
ridiculed,
suggest that they might be telling the truth. In some cases multiple
witnesses
have corroborated each other's descriptions.</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Many skeptics acknowledge that the
observers
have encountered some strange animal. The interpretation of what
witnesses
saw is most often not accepted by scientists, who suspect some error of
observation and are wary of jumping to conclusions on the basis of
irreproducable
evidence, and by laymen, who feel threatened by novelty.'Mus, a
plethora
of alternate explanations has come forward: 'What you must have seen is
an oarfish," insists the dismissive critic.</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Others are equally sure that a pod
of
leaping dolphins or belugas were seen, or a leopard seal, a family of
sea
lions, a tangle of giant kelp, and so on.</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Most cases of misinterpretation tan
be eliminated by admitting only the best evidence such as sightings at
close range, under good conditions, by sober and (preferably) numerous
witnesses who provide detailed and consistent information. The
eyewitness
accounts reported here are among the best. None of the "monsters" is
reconcilable
with any known living marine creature, which indicates that perhaps
witnesses
saw a creature thought to be extinct.</font></b>
<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This possibility has gained respect
since 1938 when Marjorie Courtenay Latimer identified a bluish,
man-sized
fish captured in the Indian Ocean off South Africa as a coelacanth,
previously
known only as a fossil fish with stubby, leg like fins, thought to be
ancestral
to land vertebrates." The last known living coelacanth had lived eighty
million years ago! The prospect of discovering more "living fossils"
has
fired both public and scientific imaginations.</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Numerous marine crypted sightings
have
been explained in terms of extinct animals such as Staller's sea cow, a
sluggish sirenian hunted to extinction by starving Russian fur traders
soon after its scientific discovery in the Bering Sea in the eighteenth
century; the zeuglodon, a serpentine, primitive whale known from
shallow
seas of the Miocene Period (twenty-five-million years ago); and
long-necked
plesiosaurs, marine reptiles from the Jurassic Period (more than
sixty-five-million
years ago)." Each of these hypotheses has its proponents, but none
draws
universal approval.</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The final possibility is, of course,
that the animals observed are entirely new and unknown to science. Most
oceanographers readily concede that the ocean may yet have secrets to
reveal.
New animals continue to be discovered, usually by accident. For
example,
the megamouth shark, a fifteen-foot-long filter feeder, was found
tangled
in the anchor chain of a United States Navy ship near Hawaii in 1976.
It
had never been observed before, and only five other specimens have been
seen since.</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">What unknown animal hides in the
coastal
waters of the Pacific Northwest? A creature with a long neck, whiskers,
a mane, and a large body with lumps on its back. An animal that makes
noises
and hisses when it surfaces; by all appearances an air-breather and a
mammal.
But why would a large air-breather be seen so rarely at the surface?
Where
would this unknown, presumed mammal, perhaps even Heuvelmans's
hypothetical
"merhorse," breed? Heuvelmans has attempted to classify marine crypteds
according to their character- istics and has hypothesized a variety of
new animals to fit the observations.</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">One of them is the "merhorse," a
long-necked,
horse-headed marine mammal with large eyes, whiskers, and a mane,
similar
to many of the observations of Caddy. Seals and other pinnipeds
congregate
in gregarious rookeries; whales engage in musical frolics. How could
such
a large, unknown marine mammal be so elusive?</font></b>
</p>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The mystery is not likely to be
solved
in the near future. Sightings are rare and apparently random. The
development
and funding of a research program that embraces review of evidence,
formulation
of hypotheses, search strategy, and instrument design in what is, after
all, a legitimate scientific question tends to be thwarted by the
stigma
of "frivolity" that mars the subject, as well as by the absence of any
obvious practical application.</font></b>
<br>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Crypto zoology, without a clear
prospect
for the betterment or enlightenment of humankind, remains a science
that
seems too "pure" for most oceanographers to pursue seriously.</font></b>

<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Sweden's Lake Storsjon is home to a
creature know as Storsjoodjuret or the shortened, Storsie.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Thousands of people have reported seeing this animal as far back as
1635.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Witnesses report the creature as being multi-humped with a thin
snakelike
body with feet and being around 20 feet long.&nbsp; The body is mostly
gray but it has been reported to also have shades of red, yellow and
black
as well.&nbsp;&nbsp; The creature is usually reported traveling at high
speeds across the lake.</font></b>
