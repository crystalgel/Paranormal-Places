  Hayfork, Calif. - A 9 foot-tall yellow-eyed beast making bloodcurdling
screams turned a group of campers as shaky  as the marshmallows they
were roasting.  They decided the creature must have been the legendary
Bigfoot.
  Tim Ford, 22, told California Department of Fish and Game officials
Thursday that he is convinced he saw the elusive man-beast, who he
claims left tracks 6 inches wide and 20 inches long in the remote
Hayfork, about 200 miles north of San Francisco.
  "You could see his arms hanging way past his knees,: Harmon told the
Redding Record Searchlight. "It was scary."
  The Redding man said he was on a camping and hunting trip near Mud
Springs, south of Hayfork, last Saturday when his friend, 28-year-old
James Harmon of Reno, Nev., heard a loud rustling in the bushes as they
roasted marshmallows.
  When he got his flashlight ot investigate the noise, Ford said he
spotted an enormous, furry creature standing about 50  yards away on the
other side of a creek.
  Ford and Harmon, who were travelilng with five others, said none of
them had been drinking or taking drugs.  They're convinced the creature
was not a bear.
  They said the creature stayed a distance from the campsite most of the
night, but was near enough that they could hear it's screams.
  Eerie screams are often reported along with sightings of Bigfoot.
