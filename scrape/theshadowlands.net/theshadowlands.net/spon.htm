<TD><B>Spontaneous human combustion is the mysterious phenomenon of a person
bursting into flame for no apparent reason.&nbsp; The flames burn very
hot and are very localized. They destroy most of the body but leave objects
in close proximity to the person relatively unburned.&nbsp;</B>&nbsp;

<P><B>These are the remains of Dr. John Bentley (on left)who died of spontaneous
combustion in&nbsp;<IMG SRC="spon1.jpg" HEIGHT=226 WIDTH=278 ALIGN=LEFT>Pennsylvania
in 1966.&nbsp; The spot where the body lay is burnt, but the rest of the
room, including the toilet, was not even scorched. This shows a quick,
hot flame that devoured the body in seconds.&nbsp; Only the bottom of one
leg remained to identify this as a person.&nbsp; On the right&nbsp; is
a picture of workers cleaning up the remains of Mrs. M H Reeser of Florida
who<IMG SRC="spon3.jpg" HEIGHT=220 WIDTH=252 ALIGN=RIGHT> apparently died
of spontaneous combustion in July of 1951.&nbsp; The only remains found
was her skull, shrunken to the size of an orange.</B>&nbsp;

<P><B>There are theories on this occurance but no one is sure how or why
it happens.&nbsp; It does happen even without scientific explanation.&nbsp;
One theory is ball lightning which would produce similar results, but many
of these instances seem to rule out this possibility just by the location
of the death.&nbsp; A majority of these deaths have the opposite characteristics
that one would see if a person was burned to death, such as the shrinking
of the skull.</B>&nbsp;

<P><B>Crematorium Specialist have viewed photos of combustion victims and
say they cannot duplicate the complete destruction of bones in such a short
period of time.&nbsp; They find it even harder to believe that this could
happen so completely in ordinary rooms such as living rooms, bathrooms,
etc.&nbsp; There are over 100 unexplained fire deaths a year just in England.&nbsp;
If just ten of these deaths are spontaneous combustion, then the number
world could be well over 100.</B>&nbsp;

<P><B>Does the body have chemical reactions that science has yet to discover
?&nbsp; It seems that an internal reaction of some kind is the most likely
explanation for these deaths, but what triggers it ? Can it be detected
?&nbsp; Avoided ?&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>&nbsp;

<P><IMG SRC="spon4.jpg" HEIGHT=240 WIDTH=320 ALIGN=LEFT>&nbsp;

<P><B>This picture is another case of spontaneous combustion that occurred
in London in 1964.&nbsp;</B>&nbsp; <B>One compiled database states the
following statistics on possible reported cases:</B>&nbsp;

<P><B>1950's -&nbsp; 11 cases</B>&nbsp;

<P><B>1960's -&nbsp; 7 cases</B>&nbsp;

<P><B>1970's -&nbsp; 13 cases</B>&nbsp;

<P><B>1980's -&nbsp; 22 cases</B>&nbsp;</TD>

<TD><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF80">1932: </FONT>Mrs. Charles Williamson suddenly
burst into flames on a Janurary morning in 1932. She lived in Bladenboro,
North Carolina. She had not been beside any kind of fire, and her dress
had not been in contact with any cleaning fluid or other flammable substances.
Her husband and daughter ripped the dress off her with their bare hands,
but not any of them were burned by the flames. Not to soon after a pair
of her husbands pants caught fire while hanging in the closet. The same
thing happened to a bed, and curtains in an unoccupied room. Although the
house was inspected by special investigators from gas and electric companies,
arson experts, and police, there could be found no logical explanation
for the sudden fires. The family described the flames as 'bluish, jetlike',
and other adjacent objects were not affected. There was no smell, and no
smoke and until the object was consumed the fire would not stop.</B> -

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">Jan. 13, 1943:</FONT> 52 year old Allen M.
Small was found burned to death in his Deer Isle, Maine home. The carpet
beneath his body was scorched, but there was no other sign of fire in the
house. Small's pipe was unlit and on a shelf, and his stove lids were all
still in place.</B> - <B>sent in by jsoverei@schreiber.Lakeheadu.Ca</B><B></B>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">March 1, 1953:</FONT> Waymon Wood's body was
discovered in the front seat of his closed car in Greenville, South Carolina.
His car was stationed on the site of Bypass Route 291. Little remained
of Wood, but his car was basically untouched, even though it contained
half a tank of gas. The windshield was the only damaged area; it had bubbled
and sagged inward, an affect from the intense heat. - sent in by bmuhwj@hotmail.com</B><B></B>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#FFFF00">October, 1964:</FONT>&nbsp; Mrs. Olga Worth
Stephens, 75 years and a former actress suddenly burst into flames while
waiting in her parked car. The burns were fatal, and she was killed before
anyone could come to her aid. Firemen later concluded that nothing in the
car could have started the blaze, and her car was undamaged. - sent in
