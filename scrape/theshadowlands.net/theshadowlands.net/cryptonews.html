<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#ffffff"><font size="+1">First
Sighting of the Mothman?</font></font></font></b>
<br>



<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#ffffff">Not quite so
clearly visible, but still definitely man-shaped, was the figure standing
in the middle of the road ahead of a woman driving her father along Route
2 in the Chief Cornstalk Hunting Grounds of West Virginia, USA, in the
1960 or 61. As they got closer, the driver slowed the car. The two apprehensive
witnesses saw that the grey figure was much larger than a man. The driver
later reported what happened next: A pair of wings unfolded from its back
and they practically filled the whole road. It almost looked like a small
airplane. Then it took off straight up, disappearing out of sight in seconds.
We were both. terrified. I stepped on the gas and raced out of there. We
talked it over and decided not to tell anybody about it. Who would believe
us anyway? Who indeed? Although she did not know it, she was possibly the
first witness of a winged, being later nicknamed &#8216;Mothman', which in late
1966 plagued the area of West Virginia called Point Pleasant. First to
see it at that time were two young local couples, Mr and Mrs Roger Scarberry
and Mr and Mrs Steve Mallette. Later on the night of November 15 they were
driving through the &#8216;TNT area' where there was an abandoned wartime explosives
factory. As they passed an old generator plant, they saw in the darkness
two bright red circles, which looked like eyes. As the circles moved, the
couples saw a man-shaped figure between 6 and 7 feet tall, greyish in color
and with big folded wings; it was shuffling along on two legs. Roger, who
was driving, quickly turned the car in the direction of safety and they
drove off at speed. But they saw the creature, or another similar one,
standing near the road and as they went past it spread its batlike wings
and began to follow them. Even though they accelerated to 100 miles per
hour, the &#8216;bird' kept pace with them, without flapping its wings. Mrs Mallette
could hear it squeaking &#8216;like a big mouse'. When they reported their experience
at the sheriff's office, the deputy could see they were scared and he drove
straight to the TNT area, but saw nothing strange. The story was publicized
and Point Pleasant immediately became a focus of attention for monster-hunters.
Armed men searched the TNT area but did not find their prey. However, Mothman
was still around: on the evening of November 16th he appeared to Mrs Marcella
Bennett who was visiting friends living in the TNT area. She was sitting
in the parked car when she noticed a figure in the darkness. &#8216;It seemed
as if it had been lying down. It rose up slowly from the ground. A big
gray thing. Bigger than a man, with terrible glowing red eyes.' Like the
two couples on the previous night Mrs Bennett seemed hypnotized by Mothman's
red eyes. As she stood there staring at it, she and her baby daughter were
grabbed by a friend and dragged into the house. During the following days,
numerous people saw Mothman, or believed they did. How many of the sightings
were caused by the &#8216;contagion' of news stories, we shall never know. The
writer John Keel went to the Point Pleasant area to investigate at first
hand. From the many reports he collected, he established that Mothman was
between 5 and 7 feet tall, grey or brown in color and man-shaped but without
any arms or head. It had luminous bright red eyes where a man's shoulders
would be. The wings were folded back when not in use, and the wingspread
was about 10 feet. The majority of sightings were made in November and
December 1966; then Mothman was gone. This article is courtesy of The World

Dover Demon</font></font></h2></center>





<center><img src="dover.gif" align="middle" height="168" width="110"></center>





<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#ffffff">The last thing
a 17 year old Bill Bartlett expected to see when driving with two friends
through Dover, Massachusetts, at around 10:30 PM on April 21, 1977 was
a creature from another dimension. Yet that is what he may have done, at
least in the opinion of some investigators-and judging from Bill's description
of what he saw, they could have a point! Driving along, his car's headlights
suddenly illuminated a peculiar entity picking its way along a stone wall
at the side of the road. As can be seen from the picture that Bill later
prepared, which is reproduced here, the creature had a disproportionately
large head, shaped like a water melon, with two big, protruding eyes that
glowed orange, but it did not seem to have a mouth, nose or ears. Its body
was small, its neck and limbs were long and thin, and its fingers and toes
were slender and supple. The creature appeared to be hairless, but it's
peach-colored skin was rough in texture. It stood about 1 meter (3-4 feet)
high, and was observed only by Bill (his two friends were not looking in
the right direction to see it). Unknown to Bill, however, his strange sighting
would soon be substantiated by an entirely independent eyewitness. Less
than two hours later, 15 year old John Baxter was walking home little more
than a mile from the locality of Bill's encounter when he saw a strange
figure coming towards him. After receiving no reply when he called out
to it, John paused, and as he did so the figure ran away down a gully.
John chased after it and when he was about 9 meters (30 feet) away, he
could see it clearly, standing upright on its hind legs and gripping the
trunk of a tree. When he spied its brightly glowing eyes staring at him
from an otherwise featureless face, however, John decided to let caution
supersede curiosity and he walked briskly back to the road. Once he reached
home, he too made a visual record of what he had witnessed, and as can
be seen here, his wholly independent illustration corresponds very closely
indeed with Bill's. At around midnight on April 22, what writer Loren Coleman
has subsequently called "The Dover Demon" was seen again, this time by
15 year old Abby Brabham while being driven home by Will Taintor, 18, who
only spied it very briefly. Abby's description matched those of Bill and
John in every respect except one: when she observed it, its eyes were glowing
green, not orange. And thus ended the curious case of the Dover Demon,
for it has never been reported again and has never been satisfactorily
identified. If the descriptions of it are accurate-and they are certainly
very consistent-the Dover Demon does not resemble any species known to
science, either from North America or elsewhere. It may not, however, be
entirely unknown. The Cree nation of eastern Canada speak of a mysterious
race of pygmy entities called the Mannegishi, who delight in playing tricks
upon travelers. According to the Cree, the Mannegishi have round heads,
long thin legs, arms with six fingers on each hand, and they live between
rocks in the rapids. Excluding the finger count discrepancy, this description
is reminiscent to the Dover Demon.</font></font></b>

<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#ffffff">Since 1913 there
have been numerous sightings in the African Congo of a creature closely
resembling the brontosaurs. Reports of dinosaur survival in Africa actually
further back than this century if you consider the rock paintings of long
necked quadrupeds. This creature is commonly known as mokele mbembe (meaning
'rainbow'), named by local pygmies. Common descriptions are of an elephant
sized creature, reddish-brown or grey with smooth skin and a long muscular
tail similar to that of an alligator. The legs are short in comparison
to the long neck which is topped by a reptilian head. Footprints left on
land are of a three-clawed foot.</font></font></b>
</p>



<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#ffffff">James Powell,
a Texan herpetologist was the leader of the first cryptozoological expedition
to the area in 1979. His report included tales of a strange animal called
n'yamala living in the swamps of Gabon which resembled the sauropod diplodocus.
the diplodocus was a gray dinosaur with a long neck and tail similar to
the brontosaurus. James Powell also said that a local witch doctor had
told him he had seen a n'yamala around 1946, of over 30 feet (9m) in length,
with a huge neck and tail, weighing at least as much as an elephant.</font></font></b>
</p>



<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#ffffff">Interesting findings
were made in the autumn of 1981 when Herman Regusters and his wife became
the first Westerners to succeed in reaching Lake Tele. They returned with
sounds recordings, plaster cast footprints, and samples of droppings. They
also claimed to have sighted mokele membe on the lake.</font></font></b>
</p>



<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#ffffff">Marecellin Agagna,
a zoologist from Brazzaville zoo led a Congolese expedition which arrived
at Lake Tele in April 1983. He also claimed a sighting of mokele mbembe
about 300 yards (275m) out on the lake. He thought the animal was reptile.
His description was of a thin reddish head with oval eyes like a crocodile.
The head was about 3 feet (90 cm) above the water, and turned from side
to side as though looking for him.</font></font></b>
</p>



<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#ffffff">By 1992, Dinosaur
fever had subsided dramatically. A Japanese film crew shot some interesting
footage in September 1992 showing unusual activity in the water of Lake
Tele. Expert opinion failed to confirm the video evidence in any way. Mitsuharo
Ondo. the director of the Bala film told how the footage had been shot
while the expedition crew were flying into the interior to begin there
overland trek of the lake. They had planned to pass over the Tele region
on the way, so they could film the lake and get an impression of the terrain
they faced ahead on foot.</font></font></b>
</p>



<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#ffffff">The Congo is full
of caves many of which are below ground level and some even stretch for
as far as 60 miles, with swamp conditions making an idea habitat for possible
creatures such as mokele mbembe.</font></font></b>
</p>



<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#ffffff">Dinosaur survival
in the Congo can not honestly be reckoned proven. On the one hand, equatorial
Africa does appear to have survived largely unchanged since the end of
the dinosaur era. On the other, 70 million years is a long time for what
appears to be a limited population to survive while adapting to the arrival
of new rivals in the food chain and without suffering a severe deterioration
of its gene pool.</font></font></b>

events on September 12, 1952.</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#ffffff">&nbsp;That day
in September is definitely a memorable one to the locals of Flatwoods.&nbsp;
Just as the New Jersey Devil is to New Jersey and as the Dover Demon is
to Dover.</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#ffffff">&nbsp;On the
afternoon of September 12th, Sheriff Carr and his deputy Long were given
a report of an object falling to earth.&nbsp; Not long afterwards, a similar
report was given by local school students.&nbsp; However it was the night
of this where the most interest lies.</font></font></b>

before the sunset, four boys saw an object fall on a hill.&nbsp; Bringing
an adult named Kathleen May and her two boys along, they journeyed up the
hill.&nbsp; What they found was quite interesting.&nbsp; Twas&#8217; a large
sphere-like object which was reported to have a diameter of about ten feet.&nbsp;
Now, afterdark, two lights suddenly shone from a distance.&nbsp; One of
the members of the group directed his flashlights towards the two lights.&nbsp;
However these were not just any lights...they were eyes!&nbsp; They were
the eyes of a creature about ten feet in height.&nbsp; The eye witnesses
described it as having, &#8220;a bright red face, bright green clothing, a head
which resembled the ace of spades, and clothing which, from the waist down,
hung in great folds&#8221;.&nbsp; Shortly after the creature realized it had
been sited, it began to hover towards the witnesses.&nbsp; The group then
retreated.</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#ffffff">&nbsp;Mrs. May
called Sheriff Carr while the four friends called their &#8220;buds&#8221;.&nbsp; Even
later that night, the original group, the sheriff, the kids&#8217; friends, a
giant mob of locals climbed the hill to see what has been reported.&nbsp;
However nothing mysterious was found.&nbsp; All that was mysterious was
that of a peculiar odor.</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#ffffff">&nbsp;The next
day, &#8220;two parallel skidmarks and a circle of flattened grass&#8221; was discovered.&nbsp;
Unopened-minded authorities tried to explain it as being that of a comet
or meteor and nothing else.&nbsp; And that the so called creature was just
an animal wrongfully identified.&nbsp; These are absurd solutions which
do not solve many factors of the event.&nbsp; These include the fact that
a meteor or comet crater would be clearly visible in the night.&nbsp; Also,
there are no known species of a land animals that are ten feet tall, stand
on two legs, and that also on top of that has a red face.</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#ffffff">&nbsp;Beginning
the next night,&nbsp; other sightings were reported.&nbsp; A mother and
daughter claimed to have spotted the creature not many miles from the hill.&nbsp;
A non-resident of Flatwoods reported seeing a &#8220;bright orange object&#8221; hovering
over Flatwoods.&nbsp; There was one more couple who reported an observation
of unusual objects overhead Flatwoods, and also reported seeing the monster.&nbsp;
Many investigators looked into this incident such as the famous John Keel
(author of the Mothman Prophecies).&nbsp; A "festival" was recently held
for the 50th year anniversary of the event. Though it has been exactly
fifty years since this event the people of Flatwoods have never solved
the mysteries of September 12th, 1952.&nbsp; -By Jarid Goodman</font></font></b>

<p><br>
<br>
</p>



<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#ffffff">Tatzelwurm (German
for worm with claws)</font></font></b>
</p>



<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#ffffff">Tatzelwurms are
creatures that live in holes.&nbsp; Sightings of these creatures center
around the Swiss and Austrian Alps. Tatzelwurms are described as mountain
dwelling dragons with a cat head, razor sharp</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#ffffff">teeth, spiked
ridges along their back, little or no neck, cylindrical body, lizard or
serpent like, scaly, and has four legs with three toes on each foot.&nbsp;
It is reported that they live mainly in the crevices on the mountains.&nbsp;
They are extremely aggressive and will attack if provoked.</font></font></b>
</p>



<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#ffffff">The first reported
sighting was in 1779 by Hans Fuchs.&nbsp; While he was out on the mountains
he had the misfortune of sighting first one, then a second one appeared.&nbsp;
Fearing for his life, he fled.&nbsp; Before</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#ffffff">he could reach
his home, he suffered a heart attack.&nbsp; However, before dying he was
able to warn his family and tell them of his harrowing experience.</font></font></b>
</p>



<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#ffffff">Tatzelwurms are
also known as Stollenwurms and as Springwurms because of their leaping
abilities.&nbsp; One report has a farmer killing a tatzelwurm that had
been hibernating.&nbsp; The blood flowed freely from its mouth, but was
green instead of red.</font></font></b>
</p>



<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#ffffff">In 1711 Jean Tinner,
a man, was on the mountain of Frumsember in Switzerland.&nbsp; He reported
to authorities that he had seen and wounded a horrible serpent with a musketshot.&nbsp;
Nearby residents had complained that their cows were without milk.&nbsp;
Mr. Tinner's lucky shot must have been fatal to the serpent creature as
the cows were giving milk after the incident was reported.</font></font></b>
</p>



<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#ffffff">In 1924 a 5 foot
long skeleton was found that resembled a lizard.&nbsp; Some have come to
view the tatzelwurm as a giant size member of the otter family or a giant
sized Asian salamander.&nbsp; It has also been considered a relative of
the American gila monster.&nbsp; It is true that sightings in recent years
have been rare, but this does not detract from their past or current existence.</font></font></b>
</p>



<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#ffffff">Living in the
crevices of the Alps is pretty much a guarantee of existing.&nbsp; Their
ability to hibernate in the extreme cold allows them to survive the elements.&nbsp;
As to surviving the human race, well, just the fact that they live in the
crevices of the Alps would insure a few of their kinds survival.&nbsp;
The depth of all the crevices is unknown and most of the crevices have
not been explored. Hmmm, like the ocean and outer space these crevices
may never be fully explored as to their depths, where they go, or what
dwells within their dark</font></font></b>

<p><a name="Big"></a><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#ffffff"><font size="+2">Big
Bird</font></font></font></b></p></center>





<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#ffffff">There is no confusing
this Big Bird with the big yellow one on Sesame Street!&nbsp; January 1,
1976 a five-foot tall, bald black bird, large red eyes, with a six-inch
long beak in the center of it's gorilla-like face was seen in the Rio Grande
Valley standing with it's wings folded around it's large body.&nbsp; This
creature will make a loud shrill "eeeee" sound and its wings sound almost
bat like.</font></font></b>
</p>



<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#ffffff">Those that have
reported seeing the creature say its face is horrifying and that the large
red eyes are pure evil.&nbsp; Animal behavior when this bird is around
is odd.&nbsp; One family reported that the bird was watching their daughter
and her playmate one late afternoon.&nbsp; The girls were terrified as
was the family dog that lived</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#ffffff">outside.&nbsp;
The dog cowered and when released to come into the house for dinner darted
and refused to leave the safety of the house.</font></font></b>
</p>



<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#ffffff">The fathers of
the two girls went to investigate the area where the creature was seen.&nbsp;
Upon arriving at the site, they found prints that were 8 inches across
squared at the top with 3-toed impressions and 1.5 inches deep in the hard
dry dirt. One of the men attempted to gauge the weight of the bird.&nbsp;
His weight was 170 pounds and even jumping down hard on the hard dry dirt,
he was unable to make even a slight impression.</font></font></b>
</p>



<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#ffffff">A second sighting
of the bird was made by a motorist on January 7, 1976.&nbsp; The driver
was startled by a big bird standing aggressively in the middle of the deserted
road with his wings wrapped around his body and whose eyes glared at him.</font></font></b>
</p>



<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#ffffff">Based on witness
reports, there are many who believe the Big Bird is possibly blue herons
or pelicans.&nbsp; Not likely since herons and pelicans do not weigh anywhere
near the 170 plus pounds that would have been required to leave the prints
mentioned earlier. We are discovering new creatures daily and even some
that were once thought extinct.&nbsp; The big bird could be a new species
or a once thought extinct one or perhaps it is a "mothman" creature!</font></font></b>
