March 1998</FONT></FONT></B></P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF8080">There is a high probability that water
ice exists at both the north and south poles of the Moon, according to
initial scientific data returned by NASA's Lunar Prospector. </FONT></B></P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF8080">The Discovery Program mission also
has produced the first operational gravity map of the entire lunar surface,
which should serve as a fundamental reference for all future lunar exploration
missions, project scientists announced today at NASA's Ames Research Center,
Moffett Field, CA. </FONT></B></P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF8080">Just two months after the launch of
the cylindrical spacecraft, mission scientists have solid evidence of the
existence of lunar water ice, including estimates of its volume, location
and distribution. &quot;We are elated at the performance of the spacecraft
and its scientific payload, as well as the resulting quality and magnitude
of information about the Moon that we already have been able to extract,&quot;
said Dr. Alan Binder, Lunar Prospector Principal Investigator from the
Lunar Research Institute, Gilroy, CA.</FONT></B></P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF8080">The presence of water ice at both lunar
poles is strongly indicated by data from the spacecraft's neutron spectrometer
instrument, according to mission scientists. Graphs of data ratios from
the neutron spectrometer &quot;reveal distinctive 3.4 percent and 2.2 percent
dips in the relevant curves over the northern and southern polar regions,
respectively,&quot; Binder said. &quot;This is the kind of data 'signature'
one would expect to find if water ice is present.&quot;</FONT></B></P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF8080">However, the Moon's water ice is not
concentrated in polar ice sheets, mission scientists cautioned. &quot;While
the evidence of water ice is quite strong, the water 'signal' itself is
relatively weak,&quot; said Dr. William Feldman, co-investigator and spectrometer
specialist at the Department of Energy's Los Alamos National Laboratory,
NM. &quot;Our data are consistent with the presence of water ice in very
low concentrations across a significant number of craters.&quot; Using
models based on other Lunar Prospector data, Binder and Feldman predict
that water ice is confined to the polar regions and exists at only a 0.3
percent to 1 percent mixing ratio in combination with the Moon's rocky
soil, or regolith.</FONT></B></P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF8080">How much lunar water ice has been detected?
Assuming a water ice depth of about a foot and a half (.5 meters) -- the
depth to which the neutron spectrometer's signal can penetrate -- Binder
and Feldman estimate that the data are equivalent to an overall range of
11 million to 330 million tons (10-300 million metric tons) of lunar water
ice, depending upon the assumptions of the model used. This quantity is
dispersed over 3,600 to 18,000 square miles (10,000-50,000 square kilometers)
of water ice- bearing deposits across the northern pole, and an additional
1,800 to 7,200 square miles (5,000-20,000 square kilometers) across the
southern polar region. Furthermore, twice as much of the water ice mixture
was detected by Lunar Prospector at the Moon's north pole as at the south.</FONT></B></P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF8080">Dr. Jim Arnold of the University of
California at San Diego previously has estimated that the most water ice
that could conceivably be present on the Moon as a result of meteoritic
and cometary impacts and other processes is 11 billion to 110 billion tons.
The amount of lunar regolith that could have been &quot;gardened&quot;
by all impacts in the past 2 billion years extends to a depth of about
6.5 feet (2 meters), he found. On that basis, Lunar Prospector's estimate
of water ice would have to be increased by a factor of up to four, to the
range of 44 million to 1.3 billion tons (40 million to 1.2 billion metric
tons). In actuality, Binder and Feldman caution that, due to the inadequacy
of existing lunar models, their current estimates &quot;could be off by
a factor of ten in either direction.&quot;</FONT></B></P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF8080">The earlier joint Defense Department-NASA
Clementine mission to the Moon used a radar-based technique that detected
ice deposits in permanently shadowed regions of the lunar south pole. It
is not possible to directly compare the results from Lunar Prospector to
Clementine because of their fundamentally different sensors, measurement
</FONT></B></P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF8080">&quot;footprints,&quot; and analysis
techniques. However, members of the Clementine science team concluded that
its radar signal detected from 110 million to 1.1 billion tons (100 million
to 1 billion metric tons) of water ice, over an upper area limit of 5,500
square miles (15,500 square kilometers) of south pole terrain.</FONT></B></P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF8080">There are various ways to estimate
the economic potential of the detected lunar water ice as a supporting
resource for future human exploration of the Moon. One way is to estimate
the cost of transporting that same volume of water ice from Earth to orbit.
Currently, it costs about $10,000 to put one pound of material into orbit.
NASA is conducting technology research with the goal of reducing that figure
by a factor of 10, to only $1,000 per pound. Using an estimate of 33 million
tons from the lower range detected by Lunar Prospector, it would cost $60
trillion to transport this volume of water to space at that rate, with
unknown additional cost of transport to the Moon's surface.</FONT></B></P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF8080">From another perspective, a typical
person consumes an estimated 100 gallons of water per day for drinking,
food preparation, bathing and washing. At that rate, the same estimate
of 33 million tons of water (7.2 billion gallons) could support a community
of 1,000 two-person households for well over a century on the lunar surface,
without recycling. </FONT></B></P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF8080">&quot;This finding by Lunar Prospector
is primarily of scientific interest at this time, with implications for
the rate and importance of cometary impacts in the history and evolution
of the Solar System,&quot; said Dr. Wesley Huntress, NASA Associate Administrator
for Space Science. &quot;A cost-effective method to mine the water crystals
from within this large volume of soil would have to be developed if it
were to become a real resource for drinking water or as the basic components
of rocket fuel to support any future human explorers.&quot;</FONT></B></P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF8080">Before the Lunar Prospector mission,
historical tracking data from various NASA Lunar Orbiter and Apollo missions
had provided evidence that the lunar gravity field is not uniform. Mass
concentrations caused by lava which filled the Moon's huge craters are
known to be the cause of the anomalies. However, precise maps of lunar
mass concentrations covering the moon's equatorial nearside region were
the only ones available.</FONT></B></P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF8080">Lunar Prospector has dramatically improved
this situation, according to co-investigator Dr. Alex Konopliv of NASA's
Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, CA. Telemetry data from Lunar Prospector
has been analyzed to produce a full gravity map of both the near and far
side of the moon. Konopliv also has identified two new mass concentrations
on the Moon's nearside that will be used to enhance geophysical modeling
of the lunar interior. This work has produced the first-ever complete engineering-quality
gravity map of the moon, a key to the operational safety and fuel-efficiency
of future lunar missions.</FONT></B></P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF8080">&quot;This spacecraft has performed
beyond all reasonable expectations,&quot; said NASA's Lunar Prospector
mission manager Scott Hubbard of Ames. &quot;The findings announced today
are just the tip of the iceberg compared to the wealth of information forthcoming
in the months and years ahead.&quot;</FONT></B></P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF8080">Lunar Prospector is scheduled to continue
its current primary data gathering mission at an altitude of 62 miles (100
kilometers) for a period of ten more months. At that time, the spacecraft
will be put into an orbit as low as six miles (10 kilometers) so that its
suite of science instruments can collect data at much finer resolution
in support of more detailed scientific studies. In addition, surface composition
and structure information developed from data returned by the spacecraft's
Gamma Ray Spectrometer instrument will be a crucial aspect of additional
analysis of the polar water ice finding over the coming months.</FONT></B></P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><B><FONT COLOR="#FF8080">The third launch in NASA's Discovery
Program of lower cost, highly focused planetary science missions, Lunar
Prospector is being implemented for NASA by Lockheed Martin, Sunnyvale,
CA, with mission management by NASA Ames. The total cost to NASA of the
mission is $63 million.</FONT></B></P></CENTER>

<CENTER><P><B><U><FONT COLOR="#FFFF80"><FONT SIZE=+2>Scientists Report
Water May Be Present on Moon </FONT></FONT></U></B></P></CENTER>

<P><FONT COLOR="#C0C0C0"><B>December 4, 1996</B> </FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#C0C0C0"><B>By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD</B> </FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#C0C0C0">Scientists think they have detected water on
the Moon, and suddenly visions of people living in lunar colonies and stopping
off there to refuel on the way to Mars seem a little less farfetched. </FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#C0C0C0">After two years of careful analysis, scientists
said Tuesday that radar signals from an American spacecraft indicated the
Moon was not as bone-dry as is usually thought. The peculiar radar signatures
suggested the presence of water ice in the permanently cold shadows of
a deep basin near the lunar south pole. </FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#C0C0C0">The ice deposit is not at all like a frozen
lake where astronauts might try skating in one-sixth gravity. Instead,
the scientists said, the survey seemed to reveal a vast landscape of some
3,000 square miles in which ice crystals are mixed with dirt, a kind of
permafrost that is presumably the residue of moisture from comets striking
the Moon over the last three billion years. </FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#C0C0C0">&quot;We think we have found ice,&quot; said
Dr. Paul D. Spudis, a geologist at the Lunar and Planetary Institute in
Houston. &quot;We are not positive. But we see signals consistent with
ice, and we think it's there.&quot; </FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#C0C0C0">But Spudis and other scientists reporting the
findings by Clementine, a small Defense Department spacecraft, acknowledged
that the discovery needed to be confirmed by an independent investigation.
That could come a year from now when another spacecraft, Lunar Prospector,
is to orbit the Moon with instruments with even greater precision for determining
the presence of lunar water. </FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#C0C0C0">A detailed report on the findings has been
published in the current issue of the journal Science. The principal scientists,
Spudis and Dr. Stewart Nozette of the Air Force Phillips Laboratory in
Alexandria, Va., described the results at a news conference Tuesday at
the Pentagon. </FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#C0C0C0">Other scientists reacted to the report with
a mixture of caution and enthusiasm. They wanted to believe, because of
the important implications for future exploration and colonization of the
Moon. But they noted that the radar results were particularly difficult
to interpret. </FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#C0C0C0">&quot;I'd be delighted if it's true,&quot;
said Dr. Bruce C. Murray, a planetary scientist at the California Institute
of Technology in Pasadena, who in 1961 predicted that water ice would be
found in polar shadows. &quot;But we need to look very carefully at the
interpretation and wait for confirmation.&quot; </FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#C0C0C0">In the journal article, the discovery team
also was extremely cautious. &quot;There are several possible explanations
for these observations,&quot; the scientists wrote, &quot;including the
possibility&quot; that the signals do not result from ice deposits. </FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#C0C0C0">But no one was ignoring the implications, if
the ice proved to be real. </FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#C0C0C0">In a statement issued by the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration, Dr. Wesley T. Huntress Jr., the agency's associate
administrator for science, said the likely existence of water ice on the
Moon &quot;could be a key ingredient in the support of future human lunar
exploration, due to its potential value as a source of the components of
rocket fuel.&quot; </FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#C0C0C0">The discovery has &quot;changed a desert to
an oasis,&quot; said John E. Pike, a space policy analyst at the Federation
of American Scientists in Washington. &quot;The Moon used to be dry, now
it's wet. Now it could become a gas station.&quot; </FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#C0C0C0">Ever since Murray's prediction in 1961, the
possibility of ice on the Moon has inspired speculation about using the
resource for people living in permanent outposts and as rocket fuel for
interplanetary travel. Using solar or nuclear power, the water ice could
be converted into its components, hydrogen and oxygen, which are valuable
rocket fuels. </FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#C0C0C0">But Dr. John M. Logsdon, director of the Space
Policy Institute at George Washington University, said it was still not
clear how practical a resource the polar ice would be. He questioned the
economic feasibility of using the water for colonies or rocket fuel in
the foreseeable future. </FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#C0C0C0">As the Clementine spacecraft discovered, the
dominant topographic feature in the south polar region of the Moon is a
huge depression called the South Pole-Aitken basin. Gouged out by a massive
asteroid nearly four billion years ago, the basin stretches 1,500 miles
and in places is as deep as eight miles, deeper than Mount Everest is high.
</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#C0C0C0">It is in the shadow of these deep walls that
the cometary ice has apparently accumulated as a mixture of dirt and rock.
Temperatures in the shadows are estimated to be as low as minus 387 degrees
Fahrenheit. Any ice in parts of the basin exposed to sunlight would have
evaporated and escaped into space. As it is, Spudis said, the ice in shadows
is not a solid sheet like a skating rink, but constitutes probably no more
than 10 percent of the material in the region, mostly dirt. </FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#C0C0C0">The ice's being near the south pole is another
reason some scientists gave for expressing reservations about its utility
any time soon. </FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#C0C0C0">In a book &quot;Mining the Sky,&quot; published
last month by Addison Wesley, Dr. John S. Lewis, a geologist at the Space
Engineering Research Center of the University of Arizona, wrote that in
many respects &quot;the lunar poles are not an attractive site for the
lunar base.&quot; They are harder to reach by spacecraft from Earth and
require more rocket energy. And it would be a difficult engineering feat
to transport the ice to a base closer to the equator. </FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#C0C0C0">Spudis noted that there was a high point in
the basin, near the actual pole, that is almost permanently in sunlight.
This would be an excellent site, he said, for a lunar installation with
solar power panels to run equipment to melt the ice for water or convert
it to breathing oxygen or rocket fuel. </FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#C0C0C0">But he conceded: &quot;We have a long way to
go before we have people living on the Moon. What this is, is an indication
that living on the Moon might be possible.&quot; </FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#C0C0C0">From an astronaut on the space shuttle Columbia
came an even more optimistic response. Told of the new findings by Mission
Control, Dr. Story Musgrave said, &quot;Clearly if there is ice and there
is water out there, that is a natural resource which is extraordinarily
important to establishing a permanent thing such as an observatory on the
Moon, or some kind of colony.&quot; </FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#C0C0C0">Nozette said the scientists were almost certain
the radar was detecting water ice, though there could be small amounts
of other substances like methane or carbon dioxide mixed in. Some 90 percent
of a comet is composed of ice and most of that is water ice. </FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#C0C0C0">About one-third of the south polar region appeared
to be in permanent shadow, the Clementine scientists said, but very little
of the north pole is in shadow. </FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#C0C0C0">The $80 million Clementine spacecraft was developed
and launched by the Defense Department's Ballistic Missile Defense Organization
to test sensing instruments for anti-missile defenses. Since the craft
would be heading near the Moon, where some of the tests could be made,
scientists got permission to put Clementine into a lunar orbit and re-map
in greater detail much of the surface. </FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#C0C0C0">Clementine was launched in January 1994 and
operated in lunar orbit for four months. It was the first American craft
to explore the Moon since the final Apollo landing in December 1972 and
the last visit by any craft since the unmanned Russian Luna 24 landed there
in 1976, picked up rock samples and returned them to Earth. </FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#C0C0C0">The next mission to the Moon is Lunar Prospector,
a small unmanned craft being developed for NASA by the Ames Research Center
in Mountain View, Calif., and built by Lockheed-Martin Corp. in Denver.
Scheduled for launching next September, the spacecraft is to go into an
orbit of the Moon that repeatedly crosses both poles. Its five remote-sensing
instruments are designed to map the composition of the lunar surface and
observe its magnetic and gravity fields. </FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#C0C0C0">Huntress of NASA said that Lunar Prospector's
two neutron spectrometers should be able to measure the amount of hydrogen
on the lunar surface to an accuracy of 50 parts per million. &quot;This
will permit scientists to infer the presence or absence of ice with greater
precision than possible via the innovative but indirect method used by
the Clementine team,&quot; he said. </FONT></B></P>
