<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Have you seen those t.v. shows on the
Discovery Channel or The Sci-Fi</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Channel where they put a person behind
a wall and have them look at a</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">picture, and have another person on
the other side of the wall describe the</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">picture down to the last detail?&nbsp;&nbsp;
Have you always thought ESP was a</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">special gift bestowed upon a select
few?&nbsp; It’s not.&nbsp; I’m going to try and</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">take the mystery out of this ability.&nbsp;
(I’ll even bet you have experienced</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">it yourself!)</FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Let’s say, for instance, you are talking
to someone, and you’re trying to</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">describe your home and the words you’re
trying to say aren’t coming out.</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Instead of “It’s a brown 2-story with
a circular driveway and has a</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">satellite dish on the roof.”&nbsp;
It comes out, “It’s big, brown circle with a</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">dish”&nbsp; The person you are talking
to says, “Oh, it’s a corner lot with a</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">circular driveway and big beautiful
rose bushes in front.”&nbsp; How did they</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">get THAT?!?&nbsp; Simple, when you
were trying to describe your house, you were</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">thinking about what it looks like.&nbsp;
As if you were LOOKING AT A PICTURE of</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">your house, but the picture was IN
YOUR MIND.&nbsp; The other person was able to</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">“see” what you were looking at, you
did not try to describe the rose bushes</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">in front of the house, you were looking
at the new satellite dish you just</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">bought!&nbsp; But the other person
looked at the whole picture, and THEY noticed</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">the rose bushes!&nbsp; That is all
ESP really is, being able to “see” what</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">another person is looking at in their
mind, like a photograph.</FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">I remember once, someone was trying
to tell me how to get to a restaurant.</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">They told me what freeway exit and
the cross streets, then they started to</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">give me a description of it.&nbsp;
All of a sudden, “BING”, I got a picture in</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">my mind of what the restaurant looked
like!&nbsp; I had never been to this</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">restaurant and so I could not have
known what it looked like, but when I</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">got there, it looked exactly like the
picture I had in my mind!&nbsp;&nbsp; That’s</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">usually how it happens.&nbsp; Out of
nowhere, I’ll just get a picture in my mind</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">of what someone is trying to communicate.</FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">You can also “pick-up” when someone
is in trouble.&nbsp; This happened to</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">someone very close to me.&nbsp; Their
husband was out of town on a business</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">trip.&nbsp; At 11:00 one night, she
suddenly became worried about him.&nbsp; She felt</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">like he was hurt and needed help.&nbsp;
She decided to stay up, “knowing”</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">something was wrong, until she heard
from him.&nbsp; At a little after midnight,</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">she got a call from the Emergency room
in the town where her husband was</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">doing business.&nbsp; Turns out he
had been mugged at 11:00 that night!</FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">I had a similar experience a few weeks
ago.&nbsp; My parents had flown to</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">another city for the day.&nbsp; (My
dad is a pilot)&nbsp; At around 4:00 that</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">afternoon, I all of a sudden became
a little concerned about them.&nbsp; I sort</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">of blew it off thinking I was just
being stupid.&nbsp; (I’m absolutely terrified</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">of small planes!) And I didn’t feel
like they were in danger, just that</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">something was “off”.&nbsp; Besides,
I knew they were due back at around 3:00.</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">That night, around 8:00, I got a call
from my dad.&nbsp; He told me they made it</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">home okay and had a nice trip.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I asked him if anything strange happened</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">with the plane on the way home.&nbsp;
He told that nothing went wrong, but some</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Airforce planes were out on maneuvers,
so he had to keep changing altitude.</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;The airport was also fogged-in
for a while and he didn’t want land at</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">another one and take a cab back to
his car.&nbsp; I asked him what time this</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">happened.&nbsp; 4:00.</FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">I’m sure you’ve had something like this
happen before.&nbsp; And quite possibly,</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">like me, you blew off the feeling,
or thought it was your own thought or</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">picture you had in your mind.&nbsp;
So, rule number one, do not invalidate a</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">feeling or picture or thought you suddenly
get out of the blue!!&nbsp; So how do</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">you know whether or not the picture
IS NOT actually yours?&nbsp;&nbsp; If you say to</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">yourself, “where did THAT come from?”&nbsp;
or, “I wonder how I got THAT!?”, or</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">you suddenly get a picture in your
mind of what the other person is talking</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">about, it was most likely their picture!</FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">If you have any ESP experiences that
you’d like to share, please feel free</FONT></B>
