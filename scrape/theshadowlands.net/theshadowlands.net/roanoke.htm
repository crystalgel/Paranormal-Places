<td><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Most Americans know the story of the
&#8220;Lost Colony&#8221;.&nbsp; It dates back to the time the Europeans began to settle
on this free land, that is now known as Virginia.&nbsp; The village of
Roanoke was the one of the first English colonies to be established on
the soil.&nbsp; However this village did not turn out to be that of a successful
one.&nbsp; The Governor of this hamlet had the name of John White.&nbsp;
The small population of Roanoke complained about their lack of food and
tools.&nbsp; They also contained frightening suspicions that the Natives
may launch a surprise attack on them.&nbsp; These complaints eventuated
in John White going to England to later return along with the proper supplies
the colonists requested.&nbsp; John White returned three long years afterwards.&nbsp;
But what he returned to was not that of a colony but of a ghost town.&nbsp;
The area which was once a village was stripped of its people.&nbsp; Houses
and other shelters were nowhere in site.&nbsp; What was left behind were
some small cannons, an opened chest, a tall fence built around the perimeter
of the former village site, and a single word inscription carved on a fence
post, &#8220;Croatoan&#8221;.&nbsp;</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b>

<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Five Popular Theories:</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b>

</p><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">1. The people of Roanoke simply left
the settlement.&nbsp;</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This is one of the more probable theories.&nbsp;
It is said that they have supposedly left Roanoke island and started settling
in the Chesapeake Bay.&nbsp; And that they built rafts or a boat of some
sort using materials torn apart from their houses.&nbsp; Close to twenty
years had passed before John Smith and his group started the well-known
settlement of Jamestown (where the popular story of Pocahontas takes place).&nbsp;
This settlement was near the Chesapeake Bay.&nbsp; The evidence in this
tale is that the ruler of the natives did indeed admit to killing the colonists.&nbsp;
They said that they had been in their land (Chesapeake Bay area) and were
then annihilated to prevent more English settlers form stealing their land.&nbsp;</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b>

</p><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">2.The whole population of Roanoke Island
was killed by a disease.</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This is an absurd theory.&nbsp; It
is true that the English had brought over some diseases.&nbsp; However,
note, there were no bodies found and the houses had disappeared.&nbsp;
Quite a ridiculous theory.&nbsp;</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b>

</p><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">3.&nbsp; The village was destroyed by
a severe storm such as a hurricane.</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Another one of the incredulous theories.&nbsp;
A hurricane could have washed away the colonists and destroyed the houses,
true.&nbsp; But the huge problem with this theory is the fence was still
standing.&nbsp; It is not possible for a storm to do as much damage as
clearing away the whole settlement when the fence remained untouched.&nbsp;</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b>

</p><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">4.&nbsp; The people of Roanoke decided
to leave Roanoke Island to live with the Natives.</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This theory is definitely probable.&nbsp;
Crotoan, which was carved on the post, was the name of an island in the
area.&nbsp; It was also the name of the group of the kind natives that
inhabited it.&nbsp; It is possible that they colonists decided to live
with the natives of Croatoan.&nbsp; Though there has not been a descent
amount of evidence to prove this theory, there also has been no evidence
against it.&nbsp;</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b>

</p><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">5.&nbsp; The colonists were killed by
the Native Americans</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This is the most probable of all five
theories.&nbsp; One important fact supports this theory.&nbsp; As one may
not know, the English men had before tried to start the colony of Roanoke
before.&nbsp; Twas a group of fifteen men.&nbsp; A little over a year had
passed since they first started the colony, before explorers decided to
check up on their hopeful progress.&nbsp; What these explorers found was
one dead body.&nbsp; It was verified that it was the work of the Natives.&nbsp;
From this past event we know that the Natives were capable of such atrocities
and also capable of hiding the bodies.&nbsp; What&#8217;s interesting is that
the Natives pulled all of that off in between less than a two year period.&nbsp;
While the &#8220;lost colony&#8221; had been deprived of its leader for a number of
three years.&nbsp; The &#8220;Indians&#8221; had a sufficient amount of time to tear
down the buildings too.&nbsp; However there has still not been enough evidence
to verify this theory.</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b>&nbsp;<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b>

</p><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is an incredible fact that hitherto
historians contain no sure explanation about what exactly happened to the
colonists and the residences of Roanoke in 1588.&nbsp;&nbsp; People have
umpteen theories on what occurred in that three year period.&nbsp; Some,
as we know, include, the spread of a disease, a hurricane, etc.&nbsp; Even
peculiar yet probable theories such as extra-terrestrial abductions have
been issued.&nbsp; Will mankind perpetually crawl in the dark when it comes
to this topic? Or, will light be discovered?</font></b>
