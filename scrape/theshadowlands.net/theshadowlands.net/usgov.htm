<B>No branch of the United States Government is currently involved with
or responsible for investigations into the possibility of alien life on
other planets or for investigating Unidentified Flying Objects (UFO's).
The US Air Force (USAF) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
(NASA) have had intermittent, independent investigations of the possibility
of alien life on other planets; however, none of these has produced factual
evidence that life exists on other planets, nor that UFO's are related
to aliens. From 1947 to 1969, the Air Force investigated UFO's; then in
1977, NASA was asked to examine the possibility of resuming UFO investigations.
After studying all of the facts available, it was determined that nothing
would be gained by further investigation, since there was an absence of
tangible evidence.</B><B></B>

<P><B>In October 1992, NASA was directed by Congress to begin a detailed
search for artificial radio signals from other civilizations under the
NASA Towards Other Planetary Systems (TOPS)/High Resolution Microwave Survey
(HRMS) program (also known as the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence
project). Congress directed NASA to end this project in October 1993, citing
pressures on the US Federal budget. The HRMS did not detect any confirmed
signal before it was stopped. However, similar work will continue in a
more limited manner through efforts of private groups and through academic
institutions. The Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence Institute (SETI
Institute) in Mountain View, CA, effectively replaced the Government project,
borrowing the signal processing system from NASA. The SETI Institute is
a nonprofit corporation conducting research in a number of fields including
all science and technology aspects of astronomy and planetary sciences,
chemical evolution, the origin of life, biological evolution, and cultural
evolution.</B><B></B>

<P><B>During several space missions, NASA astronauts have reported phenomena
not immediately explainable; however, in every instance NASA determined
that the observations could not be termed "abnormal" in the space environment.
The 1947 to 1969 USAF investigations studied UFO's under Project Blue Book.
The project, headquartered at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, was
terminated December 17, 1969. Of the total of 12,618 sightings reported
to Project Blue Book, 701 remain "unidentified."</B><B></B>

<P><B>The decision to discontinue UFO investigations was based on an evaluation
of a report prepared by the University of Colorado entitled, "Scientific
Study of Unidentified Flying Objects;" a review of the University of Colorado's
report by the National Academy of Sciences; previous UFO studies; and Air
Force experience investigating UFO reports during the 1940's, '50's and
'60's. As a result of experience, investigations, and studies since 1948,
the conclusions of Project Blue Book were: (1) no UFO reported, investigated,
and evaluated by the Air Force was ever a threat to our national security;
(2) there was no evidence submitted to, or discovered by, the Air Force
that sightings categorized as "unidentified" represented technological
developments or principles beyond the range of modern scientific knowledge;
and (3) there was no evidence indicating that sightings categorized as
"unidentified" were extraterrestrial vehicles.</B><B></B>

<P><B>With the termination of Project Blue Book, the USAF regulation establishing
and controlling the program for investigating and analyzing UFO's was rescinded.
Documentation regarding the former Project Blue Book investigation was
permanently transferred to the Modern Military Branch, National Archives
and Records Service, in Washington, DC 20408, and is available for public
review and analysis.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Since the termination of Project Blue Book, nothing has occurred
that would support a resumption of UFO investigations by the USAF or NASA.
Given the current environment of steadily decreasing defense and space
budgets, it is unlikely that the Air Force or NASA will become involved
in this type of costly project in the foreseeable future.</B><B></B>

<P><B>Since neither NASA nor the Air Force is engaged in day-to-day UFO
research, neither one reviews UFO-related articles intended for publication,
evaluates UFO-type spacecraft drawings, or accepts accounts of UFO sightings
or applications for employment in the field of aerial phenomena investigation.</B><B></B>
