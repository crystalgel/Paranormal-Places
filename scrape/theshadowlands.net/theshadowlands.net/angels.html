to look at the world in a more spiritual way.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The world is experiencing an increasing appreciation of the spiritual,
an increasing capacity for people to be with spirit, to co-create. There is so
much work that needs to be done, that we really need spiritual help in getting
it done.&nbsp; Some would say it's a part of the evolution of our collective
soul, leaving us to look inside ourselves and to seek God.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We seem to be at the threshold of a new
spiritual awakening.&nbsp; More and more Christians are being born into the </span><st1:place><st1:PlaceType><span style="font-family: Arial;">church</span></st1:PlaceType><span style="font-family: Arial;"> of </span><st1:PlaceName><span style="font-family: Arial;">God</span></st1:PlaceName></st1:place><span style="font-family: Arial;">.&nbsp;Other
religions all over the world are seeing more people come into their various
folds. The feeling and the belief that angels are real is more prevalent today
than ever before.&nbsp;We are more accepting to the appearance of angels and we
are aware of the spiritual life. There is no reason to believe it isn't the
next step in the consciousness of human beings to regularly be in tune with the
gifts of God. The knowing that He is there with all His heavenly hosts to guide
us, help us, heal us, and protect us when we need them or when we ask for them
is blessed reassurance.</span></font></big><br>

      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#ffffff"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I have a friend who was
hiking in the </span><st1:place><st1:PlaceName><span style="font-family: Arial;">Sierra

old. The other daughter was just a baby, under one year of age, and was in a
back-pack baby carrier.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>

      <div align="left">

      </div>

      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#ffffff"><span style="font-family: Arial;">They were many miles away
from the nearest person and were walking around a reservoir filled with water.
The three year old said she wanted to go play in the water. The Daddy explained
to her that the sides of the reservoir were very steep and she couldn't wade in
because those sides were too steep. The water also got deep very quickly and he
explained that she didn&#8217;t know how to swim. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>

      <div align="left">

      </div>

      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#ffffff"><span style="font-family: Arial;">The little girl understood
and they walked on around the reservoirs edge. In less than a minute, the girl
tripped and rolled down the steep bank 5 to 10 feet and into the water. She
struggled, and with each panicked move swept farther out in the water. My
friend (Daddy) raced down. He stood in the water and reached as far as he
could, but the little girl was just inches out of his reach. She was quickly
moving away from shore.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>

      <div align="left">

      </div>

      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#ffffff"><span style="font-family: Arial;">My friend (Daddy) stepped
farther into the water this time, and with water up to his waist, his feet
slipped in the steep reservoir bottom. His little girl slipped just inches out
of his reach. He took another step into the water, the steep decline this time
caused the water to be up to his shoulders. Just as he grasped her hand, his
feet slipped, however, his little girl clung to him. His head and his one year
olds head went under the water. He kicked with all his might, but couldn't get
his head above the water. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>

      <div align="left">

      </div>

      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#ffffff"><span style="font-family: Arial;">He felt they all three would
drown and he desperately prayed. &#8220;God, help me!" He raised his right hand
in a desperate effort toward the shore and felt a strong hand grasp his. My
friend (Daddy) was yanked up out of the water with his two daughters. They were
taken up the 10 feet to the flat land above the reservoir.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>

      <div align="left">

      </div>

      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#ffffff"><span style="font-family: Arial;">They were all saved! My
friend (Daddy) was laying there holding his daughters and quickly turned over
to see who had miraculously saved him. No one was there. The shore was empty.
They were the only people within miles. He knew then, that they had been saved
by an Angel. God had heard his prayer!<br>

      <div align="left">

      </div>

      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#ffffff"><span style="font-family: Arial;">It was Christmas Eve and I
was driving to a friend's house during the hectic, Los Angeles rush-hour. The
night was pitch black and raining so hard that visibility was nil. The three
lanes of traffic on congested La Cienega Blvd were stopped for a red light and
my tiny white sports car was the last in a very long line of vehicles. I was in
the far left lane, wedged next to a 2 foot high cement island, casually looking
through my rear view mirror at the reflection of the street lights and holiday
decorations on the dark, shiny wet street behind me. All of a sudden I saw the
three cars. There was one in each lane speeding towards the stopped traffic,
exceeding the speed where they could safely stop. The cars suddenly slammed on
their brakes and started sliding and swerving all over the road as they
attempted to stop.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>

      <div align="left">

      </div>

      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#ffffff"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I knew for certain that my
car would be hit and having no way to escape it, murmured, "Please, God,
help me", as I braced myself for the impact. I kept looking through the
mirror and watched the cars approach. Unexpectedly, I felt a very gentle, soft
tap at the back of my car followed by a slight lifting sensation but didn&#8217;t see
a car hit me. I then heard the crash of the cars slamming into each other. I
waited a few moments for the dust to settle and then got out of my car to see
what had happened and give assistance if anyone needed help.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>

      <div align="left">

      </div>

      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#ffffff"><span style="font-family: Arial;">As I exited, I was surprised
to find my car sitting on the cement island. I had not felt enough of an impact
to have moved that far, plus the car was exactly parallel to its original
position. It was as if it had been lifted up and moved three or four feet to
the left then gently set down. It seemed slightly strange but at the time I
really didn't give it much thought.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>

      <div align="left">

      </div>

      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#ffffff"><span style="font-family: Arial;">Fortunately, no one was
physically hurt. However, there was considerable damage to several of the
stopped cars and the three cars that had hit them. What amazed me was that
everyone wanted to know how I was and how much damage my car had suffered. I
said I was fine and that nothing had happened to me or my car, because I wasn&#8217;t
hit. With that statement, fifteen people stared at me with disbelief, asking
"What do you mean nothing happened to you?&nbsp;We saw your car fly
through the air! You got hit harder than any one else." We all walked to
my car and observed that there was not one scratch or mark on it, and also
realized that the position of my car was against all possible laws of physics.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>

      <div align="left">

      </div>

      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#ffffff"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I was thankful that there
were so many witnesses to this incident because it opened my eyes to the
miracle that had just taken place. From my perspective nothing happened and I
wasn&#8217;t hit. After the others told me what they saw. I realized that a force had
protected me by lifting my car out of harm's way. Although I didn&#8217;t see or hear
anything, I know the gentle tap and lift that I felt had to have been from my
Guardian Angel.<br>

      <div align="left">

      </div>

      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#ffffff"><span style="font-family: Arial;">A couple of nights ago I was
driving home late at night down the number 15 freeway. It was around 11:30 p.m.
My son was lying down on the back seat with his head on the opposite side of my
seat.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>

      <div align="left">

      </div>

      <p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font color="#ffffff"><span style="font-family: Arial;">I started growing very
sleepy and was having a difficulty keeping my eyes open. Just as I started to
drift off I felt fingers around my left arm and a gentle squeeze. I was
startled awake and said, "Nick, what are you doing!" I looked around
quickly and realized at that time that my son was sound asleep and his hands
were not in reaching distance of me.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>

      <div align="left">

      </div>

      <span style="font-family: Arial;"><font color="#ffffff">At first I was scared and
kept my eyes wide open and alert, wondering if I would feel it again. I kept
looking behind me from time to time. After another twenty minutes or so I
started to relax again. My eye lids were growing heavy. I felt the same
sensation one more time, but this time I wasn&#8217;t afraid. I said out loud,
"Okay, okay, I'll stay awake!" I felt the gentle touch of my Guardian
Angel who was making sure we made it home safely.</font></span>
