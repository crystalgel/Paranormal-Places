                 Extraterrestrial Life: The Drake Equation

                                  

     There is a famous formula called the Drake Equation, which estimates
     the number of technical civilizations, N, that exist in the Milky Way
     Galaxy. In this article, I present a value for N, based on my own
     estimate of the Drake equation coefficients.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                   

     The Drake Equation takes the form

               N = ng * fp * ne * fl * fi * fc * ft
     where
          ng is the number of stars in the Galaxy

          fp is the fraction of stars that have planets

          ne is the mean number of planets in a planetary system that could
          support an ecology

          fl is the fraction of suitable planets on which life actually
          arises

          fi is the fraction of inhabited worlds on which intelligent life
          arises

          fc is the fraction of worlds inhabited by intelligent life on
          which a technical civilization arises

          ft is the fraction of a planetary lifetime graced by a technical
          civilization

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

     ng

     Only the first coefficient in the Drake equation, ng, is known with
     any degree of accuracy at this time, and has been measured to be
     approximately 400,000,000,000. The remaining coefficients are all
     subject to educated guesswork, and depending on your point of view,
     give a value for N somewhere near 1 (that's us on our own) and many
     billions.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

     fp

     It is now widely accepted that stellar and planetary formation is due
     to a process of nebular accretion, and where one finds a star, there
     is a reasonable probability - some would say a high probability - of
     finding an associated planetary system. An accretion disc (which
     arises because of the conservation of angular momentum) is an ideal
     place for planets to form, and is a likely counterpart to a protostar.
     This view is reinforced by the sheer abundance of planets and moons
     that we observe in the solar system. There is also compelling
     observational evidence to suggest that some nearby stars have
     planetary systems. This being the case, it would not be unreasonable
     to ascribe a value of 0.1 to fp.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

     ne

     Given a planetary system, how many planets on average could be
     expected to be capable of supporting an ecology? For the purposes of
     this argument, I shall assume that an abundance of liquid water (an
     ocean) is the essential defining feature of such a planet, and that an
     ecological system cannot exist without it (this may in fact be a
     pessimistic assumption, as life may prevail in very different
     circumstances to those found on Earth).

     For an ocean to exist, the planetary environment must be constrained
     in terms of temperature and pressure. An outer gas giant (like
     Jupiter) would not be a likely candidate (though the moon of a gas
     giant might); nor would a rocky planet that is very close to its
     parent star. This implies a relatively small range of possible orbits
     for a suitable planet around a given star. In our own system, we seems
     to have the uncomfortably small value of 1. Let us be highly
     pessimistic, and assume that only 1% of planetary systems have a
     single planet with water oceans, and assign a value of 0.01 to ne.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

     fl

     The emergence of life on an ecologically suitable planet is not
     assured. However, in the case of the Earth, life started to form
     remarkably early in the planet's history.

     It seems common sense to think that once life has started in a place,
     it will aggressively grow and flourish, and the main difficulty seems
     to be that of becoming started in the first place. With a planet full
     of chemicals to experiment with, and geological time-scales to do it
     in, it may well be that under the right conditions, life is almost
     bound to arise. Evolution can have powerful consequences for even the
     simplest of self-replicating molecules, and the possible scenarios for
     the origins of life in the form of a primitive chemical soup have been
     replicated with limited success in the laboratory.

     However, let us again be cautious, and assume that only a tiny
     proportion of suitable planets will ever give rise to any form of
     life. Let us say that fl has a value of 0.001.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

     fi

     Given an inhabited world (of bacteria, say), what are the chances that
     intelligent life will form?

     In the case of the Earth, there are numerous instances of intelligent
     species, and since intelligence seems to be a universal weapon that
     can be employed in the struggle for survival, there are powerful
     reasons for believing that evolution will assuredly lead to the
     formation of intelligence in an emerging ecology.

     I have no difficulty in assigning a value of 0.5 to fi, even in the
     cases where cosmic impacts intermittently wipe out much of a planet's
     ecology (as has happened on Earth, for instance).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

     fc

     It is one thing to have intelligent life on a planet, and another
     matter entirely to have intelligent life that is capable of producing
     a technological civilization.

     I have already argued that intelligence is a useful aid to survival,
     and should be expected to arise in most ecologies. However, the
     evidence on this planet is that conscious thought (as we understand
     it) is a very rare thing. In fact, many believe humans to be the only
     species capable of such a way of being.

     Nevertheless, the fact that we ourselves can think, and the common
     sense point of view that animals are capable of a similar, but
     limited, mode of existence, leads me to think that fc, while it may be
     small, is not necessarily a vanishingly small number.

     I would therefore, give a value of 1%, or 0.01, to fc.

     The question of technological advancement is surely a certainty given
     a species capable of rational thought (and experiment), though it may
     take some species very much longer than others to reach the 'same'
     level (it would be difficult to conduct scientific studies in an
     aquatic environment, for instance).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

     ft

     If a planet has the lucky status of being classed as that of a
     technological civilization, for what proportion of its history is it
     likely to be classed as such? This is no easy question to answer,
     since it requires knowledge of how long the planet exists, how long it
     takes for technology to emerge, and how long a civilization can stay
     intact before it is destroyed by disease, war, or cosmic disaster.

     The only experiment we can draw experience from is that of our own
     civilization, coupled with an assumption that there is nothing
     'special' about our own particular environment (given the Drake
     coefficients, of course).

     It has taken about 4.5 billion years for our technological
     civilization to emerge, which is probably about half the anticipated
     lifetime of the Earth. If this is to be taken as nothing out of the
     ordinary, then ft has an upper value of 0.5 straight away. Further, it
     seems exceedingly unlikely that mankind will last the course. It seems
     to me quite conceivable that plague or war could end the human
     species, and at this point in time it is difficult to say whether
     technology is increasing our chances of survival or decreasing them!
     There is also the distinct possibility that mass extinctions due to
     cometary impacts occur on a periodic basis (30 million years or so) as
     the Earth wanders in and out of the Galactic plane. This does not bode
     well for humankind, but perhaps I am being unduly pessimistic. It may
     be that we are on a 'cusp' of technological development, and
     technology will rapidly advance to such an extent that such problems
     are readily overcome. Indeed, it is a possibility that the dominant
     form of intelligent life on Earth may one day take the form of an
     Immortal Superconsciousness, in which case disease, at least, could be
     ignored as a threat.

     But again, to be pessimistic, I shall assume that most species are
     self-destructive, and guess that technological civilizations, on the
     whole, could be expected to last for about one million years (ft being
     approximately 0.0001).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

     N

               N = 400,000,000,000 x 0.1 x 0.01 x 0.001 x 0.5 x 0.01 x
               0.0001

               N = 0.2

     According to my calculations, which are based on what I consider to be
     pessimistic assumptions, there are 0.2 technological civilizations to
     be found in our Galaxy at any one time.

     This is at first disappointing - the implication is that we shall
     never encounter another civilization - but at the same time, there is
     the distinct possibility that I have been massively pessimistic (in
     which case the Galaxy is teeming with life). Even a value as low as
     0.2 implies that many civilizations do arise but for short periods,
     because you will recall that I put little faith in technology's
     ability to preserve a civilization.

     Remember, the Milky Way Galaxy is but one of many. It is estimated
     that there are at least as many galaxies in the universe as there are
     stars in our own Galaxy. This means, according to my estimates, we are
     sharing the universe with another 80,000,000,000 technological
     civilizations.

     On the other hand, my figures may have been wildly optimistic in other
     respects. We shan't know, for some time yet...

     It may be worth pointing out that Carl Sagan comes up with N = 10 in
     his book, Cosmos. I computed my answer without consulting Sagan's
     estimate, and this shows me to be fifty times as pessimistic as he is.
     But, as he points out, much of the pessimism is down to economics and
     politics - if self-destruction is not the fate of most civilizations,
     we are not too far away from some very interesting neighbours!
