Fear can take all shapes and sizes.&nbsp; Fear can become a phobia
and/or an obsession if left unaddressed. Fears usually begin in
childhood and will manifest itself in many ways &#8211; hysterical crying,
freezing up, physical and emotional outbursts.&nbsp; But there are
those rare instances when the fear will begin and manifest itself in
adulthood because of a personal trauma.&nbsp; For instance, there was a
woman in the United States who after a debilitating car accident could
not make right hand turns.&nbsp; This fear became an obsessive phobia
for her as she would study maps for hours just to find a way to reach
her destination without having to make a right hand turn.&nbsp; During
the late 1200&#8217;s humankind shared a common fear which for some became an
obsessive phobia &#8211; the fear of being buried alive or most commonly
known as premature burial.&nbsp; The fear of being prematurely buried
alive is humankind&#8217;s oldest fear.<br>
      <br>
Those in the medical profession during these time periods were not as
skilled or knowledgeable as they are today.&nbsp; Barbers and surgeons
were frequently one and the same which aided in the misdiagnosis of
death.&nbsp; However, it should be noted that evidence of
&#8220;misdiagnosis&#8221; is difficult to document because there were very few
details printed on death certificates, a doctor did not need to be
present to declare someone deceased &#8211; they just needed to be told that
someone died and that&#8217;s what they attested to on the death certificate,
the pallbearers/funeral processions were not smooth frequently banging
the coffins on a wall or hitting a pothole, and the bodily functions of
the corpse can make it appear as if the person had awakened and
struggled to get out of the coffin. &nbsp;<br>
      <br>
Although the fear of premature burial reached its height in the 19th century in Europe it stretches back to ancient times. <br>
&#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The grammarian and metaphysician, Johannes Duns
Scotus died in Cologne in 1308.&nbsp; When the vault his corpse resided
in was opened later he was found lying outside the coffin. <br>
&#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Thomas A Kempis died in 1471 and was denied
canonization because splinters were found embedded under his nails.
Anyone aspiring to be a saint would not fight death if he found himself
buried alive (Wilkins, 21)!<br>
&#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Ann Green was hanged by the neck until dead &#8211; or so
they thought &#8211; in 1650 at Oxford.&nbsp; She was found to be alive after
being placed in a coffin for burial.&nbsp; One kindly gentleman
attempted to assist her back to the land of the dead by raising his
foot and stamping her chest and stomach with such severe force that he
only succeeded in completely reviving her.&nbsp; She lived a long life
and bore several children (Wilkins, 21). <br>
&#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Premature burial did not affect only the poor but
the wealthy and politically important. Emperor Zenon was buried alive
although some historians feel it was a deliberate &#8220;premature&#8221; burial
spearheaded by his wife (Wilkins, 22)<br>
&#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A young priest was in the pulpit one morning when
he was seized with giddiness.&nbsp; He soon lost the power of speech
and sunk to the floor.&nbsp; Although he could not see he could hear
voices as they prepared him for burial.&nbsp; It wasn&#8217;t until a
familiar voice spoke to him that he was able to rise.&nbsp; He was in
the pulpit the next day &#8211; business as usual (Wilkins, 23)!<br>
&#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Virginia Macdonald was buried in a Brooklyn
cemetery in 1850.&nbsp; Her mother was so persistent that she had been
buried alive that authorities finally relented and raised her
coffin.&nbsp; The lid was opened to find that her delicate hands had
been badly bitten and she was lying on her side. &nbsp;<br>
&#8226;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;When the Les Innocents cemetery in Paris, France
was moved from the center of the city to the suburbs the number of
skeletons found face down convinced the lay people and several doctors
that premature burial was very common (Wilkins, 25).<br>
      <br>
There are many other stories of men, women, and children suspected of
being buried alive when their coffins were later opened and their
fingers and hands had been chewed, faces distorted in fear, and their
bodies not just lying spilled onto the floor but several feet away
sitting in a corner huddled in fear.&nbsp; It is believed that these
people were rare instances. <br>
      <br>
Another common factor of premature burial was plaques and epidemics of
small pox and cholera to name a few.&nbsp; It has been reported that
during the black plaque people who were pronounced deceased could be
heard crying for help within the heap of dead bodies.&nbsp; Usually,
these people were left as they were and buried in mass graves &#8211; no one
had the stomach to dig them out and it would only delay work schedules
which were already overwhelming. &nbsp;<br>
      <br>
Beginning in the 1900&#8217;s funerals and burials were delayed to ensure
that the deceased was in fact deceased!&nbsp; Prior to the 1900&#8217;s there
were a couple of books that people referred to determine whether or not
someone was actually dead.&nbsp; French physician Jacques Benigne
Winslow published &#8220;The Uncertainty of the Signs of Death.&#8221;&nbsp; Dr.
Winslow was what most termed an expert in the field as he had claimed
to be placed in a coffin and prepared for burial twice.&nbsp; His
thesis was a body can be called a corpse only when signs of
putrefaction were obvious.&nbsp; In other words keep the loved one out
of the ground until the stench of decomposing flesh removed all doubt
(Wilkins, 16).<br>
      <br>
Montague Summers wrote &#8220;The Vampire: His Kith and Kin in 1928 where he
drew parallels between premature burial and the rising of the
dead.&nbsp; I&#8217;m sure he was one that insisted upon the staking of the
heart or some other form of corpse mutilation to ensure death. &nbsp;<br>
      <br>
With all this information it was a good thing that people in the early
1900&#8217;s did not hurry to bury their dead.&nbsp; Micah Hibble was
diagnosed as dead three times before the Grim Reaper actually kept him!
&nbsp;<br>
      <br>
There were diseases and conditions that gave the appearance of death to
even the healthiest of people.&nbsp; When Catalepsy occurs it is the
immobility of the muscles, the body takes on a waxy flexibility, and
can be molded into bizarre positions. This condition occurs usually
whenever hysteria, hypnotism or schizophrenia (without medicine) is
present. Fainting spells, falling into trances or comas were often
misdiagnosed as deceased.&nbsp; A sentient corpse is someone who is
aware of their surroundings but can do nothing to alert people to what
is going on.&nbsp; This is an interesting phenomenon and has been known
to occur during autopsies.<br>
      <br>
There have been a number of inventions to confirm the diagnosis of
death.&nbsp; There was a society of men and women called Society for
the Prevention of People Being Buried Alive.&nbsp; These people
encouraged the slow process of burial &#8211; Duke Wellington died in 1928
but was not buried for over two months!&nbsp; Crowbars and shovels were
buried with the loved ones so they could dig themselves out of the
grave &#8211; I&#8217;m not sure how they were to maneuver the tools &#8230;..<br>
      <br>
The wealthy had more options of course.&nbsp; Some chose special
capsules that would be penetrated by nails as the lid of the coffin was
lowered and sealed releasing a deadly poisonous gas.&nbsp; Others chose
to purchase Bateson&#8217;s Belfry which was an iron bell mounted on the lid
of the coffin just above the head. The bell could be easily rung with a
pull cord inside the coffin.&nbsp; The smallest tremor would set the
bell ringing.&nbsp; There is no record of anyone using this device
successfully!<br>
Mr. Bateson so feared premature burial that he doused himself with linseed oil and set himself on fire (www.members.tripod.com!<br>
      <br>
There were other devices used over time &#8211; a telephone, loudspeaker,
security system that could be operated from inside the vaults, and
people even left behind food and water just in case! &nbsp;<br>
      <br>
Death is a touchy subject for many people without the added fear of
premature burial or being sentient during an autopsy. No one wants to
awaken in a crypt or on a table with their body flayed open for the
world to see.&nbsp; However, that does happen. Although pronounced dead
by three doctors and almost two hours in a noose, a young man was found
to have a heart beat.&nbsp; Doctors present opened his chest and found
the heart was indeed beating with force!&nbsp; After five hours and his
chest still open to prodding fingers his heart finally quit beating and
he died.<br>
      <br>
Not only do people fear premature burial but Hollywood has made a
fortune from the topic!&nbsp; Edgar Allen Poe not only wrote &#8220;Premature
Burial&#8221; but it has made it to Broadway and on the movie screen.&nbsp;
In 1963 A Comedy of Terrors took what was a horrifying subject just a
short time ago and turned it into something funny, starring Vincent
Price, Boris Karlof, Basil Rathbone, and Peter Lorre<br>
      <br>
I&#8217;ve just touched on some of the concerns know about the fear that
humankind keeps tucked back in the dark recess of their mind but it is
less likely that one would be buried alive now days with the legal
requirements for preparing a dead body.&nbsp; The fear of premature
burial has been replaced with waking on the autopsy table!&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
Not only did people have to fear being misdiagnosed but they had to
fear the grave robbers, resurrectionists, and opportunists who saw a
profit.&nbsp; Once a corpse had been identified for burial, God help
the person because if they were not dead at the time of burial in most
cases they were murdered.&nbsp; More on that later!<br>
