Giant Deep-Sea Creature Amazes Spanish Scientists 


MADRID (Reuters) - Fishermen off northern Spain have captured a giant specimen of a strange, light-emitting, deep sea cephalopod, scientists said Friday.

The octopus-like creature, a taningia danae, weighs in at 275 pounds, measures seven feet and is easily the biggest of its type discovered.

Disappointingly for big eaters near the Asturian port of Ribadesella it will not end up on their plates, but will be preserved and displayed in a marine center whose most impressive cephalopod to date was a mere 140 pound example.
