<p><b><font face="CAC Saxon Bold,Courier New"><font color="#808080"><font size=+1>In
every culture around the world we find signs and folklore pertaining to
vampirism. In this article it is my goal to introduce you to the many faces
and characteristics of the Vampire in different countries. I also intend
to explain the different categories and classifications of vampires, as
well as introducing some more new legends. Also contained in this article
please look for more information about vampires, as I will continue to
research this species. As you know there is nothing like a good vampire
story. So without further delay onto our first legend. The story of Lillith.</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="CAC Saxon Bold,Courier New"><font color="#808080"><font size=+1>This
tale comes from a rabbinical fable called a Midrash. Lilith was the first
wife of Adam. She was cast out of Eden because she refused to assume a
subordinate sexual position. Lilith was transformed into a nocturnal monster
whom mated with animals, and sought out the children of Adam &amp; Eve,
killing them vengefully and consuming their flesh.</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="CAC Saxon Bold,Courier New"><font color="#808080"><font size=+1>There
is another version of this fable, which we will look into later when we
examine the different species of vampires in other cultures.</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="CAC Saxon Bold,Courier New"><font color="#808080"><font size=+1>How
about a little vampire humor to set the stage:</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="CAC Saxon Bold,Courier New"><font color="#808080"><font size=+1>Imagine
vampire astronauts. Now what about being in orbit, where the sun appears
above the horizon about once an hour. You get up. You go back to bed. You
get up. You go back to bed.</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="CAC Saxon Bold,Courier New"><font color="#808080"><font size=+1>Lets
start off with some quotes from a few authors that have written extensively
on the subject of Vampires.</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="CAC Saxon Bold,Courier New"><font color="#808080"><font size=+1>"Vampirism
was one of the most demonic outbreaks of mass hysteria ever to sweep the
world. Its origins are rooted at the beginning of time and almost all of
them are founded on superstition."</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="CAC Saxon Bold,Courier New"><font color="#808080"><font size=+1>Anthony
Masters- THE NATIONAL HISTORY OF THE VAMPIRE.</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="CAC Saxon Bold,Courier New"><font color="#808080"><font size=+1>"The
origins of the vampire myth lie in the mystery cults of oriental civilizations…..The
Nepalese Lord of Death, The Tibetan Devil, and the Mongolian God of Time."</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="CAC Saxon Bold,Courier New"><font color="#808080"><font size=+1>Devandra
P. Varma- THE VAMPIRE IN MYTH LEGEND A LORE</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="CAC Saxon Bold,Courier New"><font color="#808080"><font size=+1>"There
is evidence to suggest that the vampire emerged at one time and place,
and then diffused around the world from that primal source."</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="CAC Saxon Bold,Courier New"><font color="#808080"><font size=+1>J
Gordon Melton- THE VAMPIRE BOOK: ENCYCLOPEDIA OF THE UNDEAD</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="CAC Saxon Bold,Courier New"><font color="#808080"><font size=+1>Thus
we begin a study of the vampire in different cultures. At one time it was
believed that vampires were ranked highest among the demons as chief agents
of sin by the different cultures of the world. Almost every country has
some sort of vampire legend. Often they have two or three legends. The
stories can be traced back as far as the time of Egyptian pyramid building.
Egypt or India has been considered the birthplace of the vampire. It also
has been suggested that the home of the vampire is Tibet. Santorini is
traditionally the most vampire-infested place in the world.</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="CAC Saxon Bold,Courier New"><font color="#808080"><font size=+1>Some
characteristics that different cultures attributed to vampires are quite
interesting and should be noted. The Greeks and regions of the Balkans
believed that blue-eyed people were most likely to become vampires, this
belief was due to the fact that there was a serious lack of blue-eyed people
in that region. They were different and therefore there must be something
wrong with them. The Irish believed that blue or gray-eyed people had the
ability to see ghosts and as vampires where sometimes considered the walking
dead these people would be able to see them for what they were also. The
Greek also believed that red hair combined with blue eyes was a vampiric
attribute. An interesting note, in European folklore there was never mention
of fangs as an attribute of the vampire. Earliest mention of fangs is in
literature, VARNEY THE VAMPIRE in 1840.</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="CAC Saxon Bold,Courier New"><font color="#808080"><font size=+1>We
can also look at the study of the Slavic and American Vampire. Considering
the original association with evil, disease and death it is amazing that
this creature of darkness has become the most sensually appealing part
of American culture today. The vampire image originated in Slavic traditions.
The image that we started with before literature and Hollywood started
messing with it was a horrible beast.</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="CAC Saxon Bold,Courier New"><font color="#808080"><font size=+1>Prime
example of this creature would be the Balkan vampire. The vampire of Eastern
Europe was often considered either a very old woman or a very young woman.
There are only rare examples of male Vampires, and when they turn up their
characteristics are usually quite different. The version of the male vampire
is not a noble one, they tended to be the of the opposite social strata.
Hermits and the homeless were often targeted as vampires and put on trial
for the murderous ways in Medieval Europe.</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="CAC Saxon Bold,Courier New"><font color="#808080"><font size=+1>When
we look at the vampires myths origination one can understand why some beliefs
are that the vampire originated in the Far East. Such places as China,
Tibet and India. With the track caravans moving along the silk routes to
the Mediterranean and then spreading the stories out along the Black sea
coast to Greece, the Balkans and of course the Carpathian Mountains, including
Hungary and Transylvania. Slavs came from the north of the Black Sea and
were closely related to the Iranians.</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="CAC Saxon Bold,Courier New"><font color="#808080"><font size=+1>Another
facet of this tale to look into is between the Church and Vampirism. With
Christianity in the world the role great evil changed. One god and one
strength, evil thus became weakened. Vampires of seduction, possession
and death were considered the minions of the devil along with alchemists,
witches, sorcerers and atheists. When the Catholic Church formerly broke
in 1054 AD the Bulgarians, Russians and Serbian’s staying Orthodox, while
Poles Czechs and Croatians went Roman Catholic. This split caused a big
difference in the development of vampire lore. The Roman Church believed
that incorrupt bodies were saints, while the Orthodox Church believed these
same incorrupt bodies were those of vampires. Roman Christianity won out
with the vampires and other pagan beliefs only surviving in folklore.</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="CAC Saxon Bold,Courier New"><font color="#808080"><font size=+1>While
researching for this article I came across a quite interesting piece of
work on the Web Site PATHWAYS TO DARKNESS. It was part of a collection
called "In the Blood" written by Steve Bernheisel. This piece explores
the similarities between the Catholic Church and vampirism by our modern
definitions.</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="CAC Saxon Bold,Courier New"><font color="#808080"><font size=+1>The
link between the church and Vampirism is the act of communion. Millions
of Catholics participate in this act every time that they attend mass.
By drinking the wine and eating the host they are eating and drinking the
body and blood of Christ. The theory here is that by drinking the blood
(wine) of Christ you have eternal life with God.</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="CAC Saxon Bold,Courier New"><font color="#808080"><font size=+1>This
is similar to the vampire but only in modern traditions; (keep in mind
that the earlier vampire traditions of Europe did not always depict the
creature as one who rose from the dead. It was more like a beast or cannibal.)
Our modern day vampire folklore however, shows that our risen from the
dead creature drinks blood and is given eternal life, as blood is the life
essence of all creatures. This is something to think about.</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="CAC Saxon Bold,Courier New"><font color="#808080"><font size=+1>Here
is some further information about the vampire that I did not have at the
time the first article was written. Basically the following are all preventative
measures. You can keep a vampire in his grave by nailing his clothes to
the coffin walls; this will also prevent him from eating the shroud. Another
form of prevention was opening the graves and checking to see if the corpse
has become one of the undead. A child’s grave would be opened after three
years, a young person would be given five years before the opening, and
an adult would be checked after seven years. Also one could try placing
a headstone over the grave, it seems that headstones were not originally
used as a remembrance of loved ones, but as a weight to prevent a vampire
from escaping. Try burying food with the vampire, as a well-fed vampire
does not feel the need to cannibalize itself or leave the grave to vampirize
others. The last way to document is taking the left sock from the corpse
and filling it with stones, then throw it into the river.</font></font></font></b>
<center>
<p><b><font face="CAC Saxon Bold,Courier New"><font color="#808080"><font size=+1>The
varieties of vampires</font></font></font></b></center>

<p><b><font face="CAC Saxon Bold,Courier New"><font color="#808080"><font size=+1>From
the erotic tales of the Lamia in Roman &amp; Greek literature to the decrepit
depictions of the Raksas by the Hindu’s Vedas, one can see a certain evolution
of the role of the vampire that parallels humanities concept of the forbidden
&amp; evil. People of polytheistic religions with many Gods and Goddesses
who are all assigned certain responsibilities., would most likely be able
to recognize the various degrees of good and bad and the importance of
all in life. Those of a monotheistic belief would most certainly have set
definitions of what is good and what is evil in a black &amp; white outlook.
This is something to keep in mind while reviewing the following information
on the varieties of vampires. Also a critically important characteristic
to watch for is the selective feeding practices of the vampire, they are
partial to children and members of the opposite sex.</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="CAC Saxon Bold,Courier New"><font color="#808080"><font size=+1>So
without much further ado here is the list of Vampires in different Cultures:</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="CAC Saxon Bold,Courier New"><font color="#808080"><font size=+1>The
walking dead, the Drauger &amp; Aptranger in Old Norse literature-</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="CAC Saxon Bold,Courier New"><font color="#808080"><font size=+1>From
the people who brought us Beowulf comes even more fun creatures. The Vikings
concept of the afterlife, once dead body placed in the grave believed to
become animated with a strange life and power. The dead person continued
a pseudo life within the grave. These creatures are not depicted as a spirit
or ghost, more like a description of a Nosferastu. The undead were known
by many different names in Norse literature.</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="CAC Saxon Bold,Courier New"><font color="#808080"><font size=+1>Haubui-
(Norwiegin)- a mound dweller. A dead body living on in its tomb. Rarely
found far from the burial place. They will only harm those who dare to
trespass on it’s grave.</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="CAC Saxon Bold,Courier New"><font color="#808080"><font size=+1>Drauger-
Icelandic Saga- this is an animated corpse that comes forth from its grave
mound or shows restlessness on the way to the burial place. This creature
is also know as an Aptrgangr (after-goer or one who walkers after death.)
The Draugr is the roaming undead most frequently encountered in Icelandic
Sagas. Whichever name used, the undead of Scandinavia was a physical body,
the actual corpse of the deceased.</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="CAC Saxon Bold,Courier New"><font color="#808080"><font size=+1>The
physical descriptions of the undead in Scandinavian cultures are said to
be "hel-blar" or black as death. Another term used to describe the undead
is "na-fole" meaning corpse pale. The other characteristics of the Draugr
are the undead sports that can swell to an enormous size and also heavy
which suggests that the swelling be not due to decay gases. Described as
being uncorrupt and for many years after death. The creature has extreme
strength. They tend to kill by crushing their victim to death.</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="CAC Saxon Bold,Courier New"><font color="#808080"><font size=+1>The
Draugre also possessed magical powers, they had knowledge of the future,
can control the weather, shape-shifting capabilities. The Draugre could
also move magically through the earth, as though they were swimming through
the stone.</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="CAC Saxon Bold,Courier New"><font color="#808080"><font size=+1>Luckily
for the Vikings there were precaution that they could take against the
Draugre. These precautions were practiced from Viking times to present
to prevent the dead from rising again in Scandinavia. Some of the easier
ways to prevent the dead from rising they could place an open pair of scissors
on the dead persons chest, laying straws crosswise under the shroud, they
would also tie the big toes together so that the legs could not be separated
and needles run into the soles of the feet.</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="CAC Saxon Bold,Courier New"><font color="#808080"><font size=+1>The
precautions listed above were always done directly to the corpse, the following
however, were precautions taken on the things surrounding the corpse to
prevent it from rising. When the coffin is carried out, the bearers would
stop at the door, just within the threshold and they would raise and lower
the coffin three times in different directions, thus forming the sign of
the cross. Once this has been done all the chairs and stools on which the
casket had rested on, must be turned over. During the actual burial, in
the churchyard, the parson must pray for the rest of the dead and binds
the grave itself with magical words, thus making it impossible for the
dead to escape.</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="CAC Saxon Bold,Courier New"><font color="#808080"><font size=+1>The
Scandinavians also had special corpse doors in the home. These were bricked
up openings that could be torn down to remove the coffin, feet first. Then
the doorway would be resealed again firmly. This was done immediately</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="CAC Saxon Bold,Courier New"><font color="#808080"><font size=+1>Because
it was believed that the dead could only enter a home from the way that
they were removed. By removing the corpse feet first it was thought that
they were depriving the undead of a clear view of how they were removed
from their home.</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="CAC Saxon Bold,Courier New"><font color="#808080"><font size=+1>Considering
the time period during which the legends of Scandinavia were created it
is no surprise that they were unaware of the effect that the germs from
the corpses had on them. So, of course, they believed that the deads were
just trying to spread evil. As the draugre was dead it was felt that they
had a longing for the things of life and even envied those still alive.
They felt cold, hungry and longed for their loved ones. So to express their
feelings and needs they killed things. They would decimate livestock of
those that they cared about by running them to death.</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="CAC Saxon Bold,Courier New"><font color="#808080"><font size=+1>To
kill the Draugre, one must overcome them by hand to hand combat, wrestling
it until it has been subdued. Then the combatant must decapitate the ghost
with a sword. Some traditions have the hero leap or walk between the head
and body three times. Or the hero could drive a wooden stake into the headless
body. The final step was to burn the remains until they became cold ashes
and then either bury the ashes in a remote spot or throw them out to sea.</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="CAC Saxon Bold,Courier New"><font color="#808080"><font size=+1>Note
that the Draugre and the Grendel of Beowulf display a lot of the same characteristics.
The Grendel was a giant shape-shifting creature, a dweller of the supernatural
environment. The Grendel spends most of its time acting out motives of
envy and desire for the things in life (does this sound vaguely familiar.).
Incorporated are elements from the old Germanic culture of Anglo-Saxons
and newer influences of Christianity.</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="CAC Saxon Bold,Courier New"><font color="#808080"><font size=+1>"The
Vrykolakas {Greek for vampire} is the body of an evil and wicked man, often
one who has been excommunicated. Such bodies do not, like other corpses,
decompose after burial, but having a very tough skin, become swollen and
distended…" by Leo Allatius, ON CURRENT OPINIONS OF CERTAIN GREEKS. (1645)</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="CAC Saxon Bold,Courier New"><font color="#808080"><font size=+1>The
Vrykolakas were an incredibly ravenous creature. This is especially true
as there were two different species of the Vrykolakas. One was dead and
returned from the grave and the other, alive, but in a dreamlike state,
as though they were sleep walking. The latter, was usually spotted roaming
at night when the moon is full. Seized by thirst and blood, they go out
at night, scour the country biting and tearing all that the meet, both
man and beast.</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="CAC Saxon Bold,Courier New"><font color="#808080"><font size=+1>The
Vrykolakas also have roots in Macedonia, (which is not only associated
with Greece, but also the Balkan area). These creatures are active from
10pm until the first cockcrow in the morning. They have become vampires
from natural causes, in this case from having a desire to have wine over
its face. The cure for this species is by pouring boiling oil over it or
else by sticking a long nail into its navel. It would also be worthwhile
spreading birdseed over the tomb, because it will have to count the seeds
before leaving.</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="CAC Saxon Bold,Courier New"><font color="#808080"><font size=+1>In
the Adriatic and Aegean regions the Vrykolakas travels at night and knocks
upon doors, calling out the name of someone inside. If the person responds
they will die soon after. This particular species gains power as it ages.</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="CAC Saxon Bold,Courier New"><font color="#808080"><font size=+1>The
Kathakano is a vampire from Crete; they are very similar to the most common
garden variety of vampires, with one exception. they can only be killed
by chopping off the head and boiling it in vinegar. The Catakano is from
the Crete &amp; Rhodes area. They are described as having a mouth that
is always grinning, showing very white teeth. It spits blood onto its victim’s
skin, producing horrible burns. The cure for this form of vampirism is
burning its nails in flames, boiling its head in vinegar or isolating it
behind a barrier of water, salted if possible.</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="CAC Saxon Bold,Courier New"><font color="#808080"><font size=+1>The
Lamia is part of Greek and Roman Mythology and folklore.. These are exclusively
female vampires, which often appear as half-human, half animal (most often
a snake and always the lower part of the body.). They ate the flesh of
their victims as well as drinking their blood. Lamias could be attacked
and killed with normal weapons.</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="CAC Saxon Bold,Courier New"><font color="#808080"><font size=+1>The
Lamia was created. At one time she was the Queen of Libya and feel in love
with Zeus, the leader f the Gods. Together the God and the mortal woman
had many children. Zeus’s wife Hera, found out about the affair between
her husband and the Queen, she found out about the children fathered by
her husband. She decided to teach the queen a lesson by killing her children
and then killing the Queen. Because of her punishment, Lamia decides to
take her revenge. She has decided that all should be punished. Women should
suffer as she did by losing their children, on which she feeds. Also she
is reputed to entice men into sexual intercourse, then devours them in
a gruesome fashion. Through these sexual encounters she bore many supernatural
children, collectively known as the Lamiae. The children were sorceresses
with the head and breast of a beautiful woman and the bodies of snakes.
They used their siren like voices to lure men and children to them, and
then they devoured them by sucking their blood.</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="CAC Saxon Bold,Courier New"><font color="#808080"><font size=+1>The
Brucolaco is a Greek vampire. It is decried as having swollen, tense and
hard skin, as though it had been tanned. When hit this vampire sounds like
a drum, for this reason it is nicknamed Timpanita. He has a sonorous voice,
but it can also emit one scream per night. He causes death to anyone who
responds to his nightly call, thereby spreading the plague. It has become
a vampire by being excommunicated from the church. The preventative cure
is not to excommunicate it when alive. A minor method of defense, when
hearing the vampires calls at night, not to answer until repeated the second
time. When the evil becomes apparent from the grave, one must cut off the
head of the vampire and burn it. At Milo it is advised to cut the head
of the vampire off, cut it into pieces and boil it in wine.</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="CAC Saxon Bold,Courier New"><font color="#808080"><font size=+1>The
Bruculaco are from the Greek regions of Thessaly and Epirus are people
who fall into Catalepsis; the soul thus being momentarily separated from
the body and going into that of a wolf making it thirsty for flesh and
blood.</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="CAC Saxon Bold,Courier New"><font color="#808080"><font size=+1>The
Vrykolatios is a vampire of the Island of Santorini. They are described
as fiends, which banquet, on the living. Keep in mind that the Island of
Santorini is considered one of the most vampire infested places in the
world.</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="CAC Saxon Bold,Courier New"><font color="#808080"><font size=+1>The
Empusa another Greek vampire. This one possesses a demonic spirit that
could enter the body. They are usually said to be in the attendance to
the Goddess Hecate. Described as demons, which can take human form from
time to time, their most common incarnation is a Phoenician woman.</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="CAC Saxon Bold,Courier New"><font color="#808080"><font size=+1>The
Mormo was also a Greek vampire. It was considered a terrible denizen of
Hades that attended to the witch-Goddess Hecate. Apparently they were quite
nasty little creatures; however, little other information is given about
them.</font></font></font></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="CAC Saxon Bold,Courier New"><font color="#808080"><font size=+1>From
the Grecian Islands we now move on to Russian Vampire Lore. Our first look
at Russia gives us the Upir &amp; Upyr. They were a very integral part
of Russian FolkLore. This vampire was able to walk the earth in broad daylight
and according to legend the Upir rose at noon and fed from the populace
until midnight, when it was forced to return to it’s grave to rest.</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="CAC Saxon Bold,Courier New"><font color="#808080"><font size=+1>The
Upir was also popular in the Ukrainian region of Russia; this version was
noted to eat large amounts of fish.</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="CAC Saxon Bold,Courier New"><font color="#808080"><font size=+1>Another
legend related to the Upyr in Russia showed us a vampire that was considered
extremely vicious. It will first attack children and then continue on to
kill the parents. It rose during the day and slept at night, and in doing
so had a fairly human appearance.</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="CAC Saxon Bold,Courier New"><font color="#808080"><font size=+1>The
Upierci of Russia becomes a vampire by suicide, violent death or practicing
witchcraft during one’s lifetime. They could cause drought, even dry the
dew on most plants. The cure for this type of vampirism was to drown the
vampire in a lake or river (salt water was not indicated). You could also
destroy this vampire by transfixing it with a nail, however, you must not
hit the nail more than once or the Upierci will revive.</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="CAC Saxon Bold,Courier New"><font color="#808080"><font size=+1>We
also have another vampire with a Similar spelling, the Upierczi, was seen
in both Russian and Polish folklore. These vampires were also known as
Viesczy. They had stingers under their tongues, which was used instead
of fangs. They were active from noon until midnight and could only be destroyed
by burning. When burned, the body would burst, giving rise to hundreds
of small disgusting animals (maggots, rats, etc.). If any of these creatures
were to escape then the Upierczy spirit will escape too, and will seek
revenge.</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="CAC Saxon Bold,Courier New"><font color="#808080"><font size=+1>The
Myertovjec was a favorite of the European Russians. It had a purple face
and was active from midnight until the cock crows thrice in the morning.
They became a vampire from natural causes; if the deceased was the son
of a werewolf or witch; or else if in lifetime it had behaved as a werewolf,
a sorcerer, an apostate, or if it had cursed it’s own father or the church.
The cure for this type of vampire is only preventative; one could sprinkle
poppy seeds along the road leading from the tomb to the house of the deceased.
When the evil becomes apparent, the people closest to the vampire must
either transfix the creature through the chest, nailing it to the coffin
or else burn it.</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="CAC Saxon Bold,Courier New"><font color="#808080"><font size=+1>The
Vourdulak is also a Russian vampire. In Russian folklore to be a beautiful
but evil woman. I haven’t been able to find any more than that on this
one.</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="CAC Saxon Bold,Courier New"><font color="#808080"><font size=+1>The
Eretica was a formidable Russian vampire species. It was an evil Russian
spirit, who was a heretic returned from the dead, o woman who sold her
soul in life, or a mixture of both. They take the form of a haggard old
woman and gather in Ravines to perform a sort of Sabbath. They are active
only during spring and autumn, and the result of seeing the eyes of one
would result in a slow and painful death.</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="CAC Saxon Bold,Courier New"><font color="#808080"><font size=+1>From
Russia we now move onto Romania, these people really had some interesting
vampire folklore. I think the best place to start would be the Moroi. These
vampires are considered one of the undead, but they were viewed more as
guardians of their mortal families. Obviously, one of the more friendly
vampires or spirits. They can be male or female, they do, however, exhibit
some of the characteristics of the Strigolii. Another trait mentioned about
the Moroi is that they went out at night to fornicate with whomever they
stumble across.</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="CAC Saxon Bold,Courier New"><font color="#808080"><font size=+1>The
Strigoi of Romania is also one of the undead. They attract utter revulsion
and fear of the populace. They were a blood drinking species and hunted
by most of those living in the Balkans. Another source claims that the
Stirgoi are living, (as opposed to the undead), the soul has the ability
to voluntarily leave the body at night. Sometimes such souls appear as
sparks traveling through the air. They could take the form of insects or
higher animals. They are not usually associated with blood sucking. They
could steal the vitality of their neighbor’s crops, beehives, etc. The
Romanian word Stirgoi is derived from the Latin word Stryx. Romanians believed
in "witches" that would change into screech owls at night to prey on unattended
infants by drinking their blood and sometimes eating their internal organs.</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="CAC Saxon Bold,Courier New"><font color="#808080"><font size=+1>The
Strigoiu are legends from the Wallachian region of Romania. They are infamous
in Romania and considered undead. It was said that they lived at night
in an abandoned or ruined house. They became vampires they had red hair,
or were the son of a seventh son. The preventative nail it to the coffin
or else cover the tomb with tow and then put a certain quantity of explosive
in it and blow it up. They were said to be generally friendly towards Gypsies.</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="CAC Saxon Bold,Courier New"><font color="#808080"><font size=+1>The
Strigoiul, yet another version of this vampire legend found in Romania.
They were very much like the original vampire legends with the exception
that they like to attack in flocks. They can be killed by putting garlic
in its mouth or by removing it’s heart. It was sometimes considered a demon
or a witch.</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="CAC Saxon Bold,Courier New"><font color="#808080"><font size=+1>The
Varcolaco, and Murohy are also of Romania. The characteristics of these
beasts are that they can take on the aspect of a dog, a cat, a frog, a
toad, a louse, a flea or a spider and they are particularly active on St.
George’s day and St. Andrews Day. They became vampires generally through
heredity, but also by dying unbaptised or by suicide. They can bite without
leaving any signs of a wound. The preventative cures include tying a thorny
bush to the shroud. It was believed that suicides especially should be
put in running water as soon as they are dead. As soon as the evil becomes
apparent, one should remove the heart and cut it in two, plant a nail in
the forehead put a spoonful of quicklime or a head of garlic in its mouth.
Some other preventative cures include smearing the body with fat of a pig
killed on St. Ignatius day, sprinkle shroud with holy water, take the corpse
far away into the mountains and leave it there. If the vampire is female,
plant some iron forks in its heart and eyes then bury it in a very deep
grave face downwards. An interesting note here, the reason that vampires
are buried face downwards is that if they try to dig themselves out of
the grave they only dig themselves deeper into the earth.</font></font></font></b>

<p><b><font face="CAC Saxon Bold,Courier New"><font color="#808080"><font size=+1>The
Norferat of Romania became a vampire by being the illegitimate son of two
illegitimate parents, or by being the seventh son of a seventh son. They
would appear as an attractive person of the opposite sex who would repeatedly
visit the homes of their victims. The victims would then slowly lose vitality
and die of illness and exhaustion; this apparently took some time. Some
stories even depict them as those who have been separated or torn apart
from those that they love in life and in death seek to be reunited with
their lost loved ones. Another added attraction of this vampire is their
ability to make the husbands of their loved ones impotent.</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="CAC Saxon Bold,Courier New"><font color="#808080"><font size=+1>The
most recognizable name on this list of Romanian vampires is the Nosferatu.
This was a spirit that again was the illegitimate child of illegitimate
parents. It had a strong hatred for newly married couples due to it’s own
illegitimacy and wreaks havoc on such couples as making the groom impotent,
the bride barren or a mixture of both. Soon after burial, the Nosferatu
embarks on a long career of destruction. It delights in tormenting and
enjoys engaging in wild orgies with the living. The male of this species
can father children.</font></font></font></b>

next part our journey takes us to Albania, Here we find the Shtriga. This
species was an elderly woman who preyed upon infants by drinking their
blood. They also caused adults to wither and die. They could change into
a moth, fly or bee at night. Albanians blamed these creatures for crib
death. Ironically most Albanian infants who died in their cribs, died from
the being so over protected form the shtriga with swaddling blankets. Most
of these children grew pale and sick from the lack of sunshine.</font></font></font></b>

blood. It spreads death and destruction wherever it goes. While investigating
these beasts I found another source that stated that these creatures were
said to be reasonably harmless, only feeding briefly on its victims, not
actually killing them. Again proving that almost every source you use is
going to have a different story.</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="CAC Saxon Bold,Courier New"><font color="#808080"><font size=+1>Onto
Africa and the Asanbosam of the Ashanti of Southern Ghana. They are considered
normal vampires with the exception that they have hooks instead of feet
and they tend to bite their victims on the thumb. They like to attack sleeping
people in villages, and they aren’t very particular for they will attack
men, women and children. An interesting note to add here is that vampires
bats rarely attack humans, but when they do, it is usually on the thumb
and the bats that attack are usually rabid. In other regions of Africa,
such as Togo and the Ivory coast, the Asanbosam are believe to reside deep
in the forests, most often they are encountered by hunters. They take generally
take human shape, with two exceptions; their teeth are made out of iron
and their legs have hook like appendages. Anyone walking by the tree in
which it resides will be scooped up and killed.</font></font></font></b>

in crops.</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="CAC Saxon Bold,Courier New"><font color="#808080"><font size=+1>The

<p><b><font face="CAC Saxon Bold,Courier New"><font color="#808080"><font size=+1>In
Serbia &amp; Montenegro We find quite a few tales of folklore concerning
the vampire. Lets start with the Veshtiza, this was an old woman possessed
by an evil spirit. The soul leaves her body at night while she is sleeping
and wanders until she enters the body of a hen or a black moth. In the
body of the creature she flies around until she finds a home inhabited
with infants or young children. Her favorite food is the heart of infants.
At midnight the Veshtiza would sometimes flock together in the branches
of some tree and hold a meeting while snacking upon what they gathered
that night. An old woman having the attributes of a witch may join the
meeting. She must recite certain stereotyped phrases to participate in
the gathering. The phrases were never given in my research source. Another
source states that the Veshtiza was a witch and entered the homes of neighbors
in the form of a moth or fly. She would then bite them. The victim over
a period of time would grow pale, develop a fever and eventually perish.
In Montengro, not only did they believe in the Veshtiza, they also believed
that a corpse could become a vampire in an animal jumped over it, and that
the undead type of vampires would return to their graves in the form of
mice. One tribe of Montenegrains believed that vampires spent part of their
time in the form of wolves.</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="CAC Saxon Bold,Courier New"><font color="#808080"><font size=+1>The
Vlokoslak is a Serbian vampire that was also called a Mulo. They normally
would appear as people wearing white clothes. They could assume the shape
of horses and sheep. They were active day and night. They would eat their
victims as well as drink their blood. One could kill this species of vampire
by cutting off the toes or by driving a nail through its neck.</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="CAC Saxon Bold,Courier New"><font color="#808080"><font size=+1>The
Vlkodlak has the congested face of an impertinent drunkard and blood colored
skin. Always aged more than twenty and can remain active for seven years,
then becomes a man again to repeat the process in another part country.
This unfortunate once human being becomes part of this species of vampire
by committing one of the following misdeeds in life; murder, perjury, incest
with its mother. Another way that the dead would become a Vlkodlak is by
having been killed by a were-wolf or by eating a lamb that was killed by
a were-wolf. The specialty of this species was causing solar or lunar eclipses.</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="CAC Saxon Bold,Courier New"><font color="#808080"><font size=+1>To
prevent the dead from becoming one of these vampires you would have to
cut off the toes and thumbs of the corpse or put a nail into its neck.
If the undead has already risen one could try piercing the navel of the
creature with the branch of a Hawthorne and cover all of the hairy parts
with tow, then set it on fire. To light the fire one must use the candles
that were used for the death vigil.</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="CAC Saxon Bold,Courier New"><font color="#808080"><font size=+1>The
Vukodlak of Montenegro is said to be able to easily turn itself into a
wolf and only goes out to hunt when there is a full moon. You would be
able to tell the resting-place of this species because crows will never
go near the tomb.</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="CAC Saxon Bold,Courier New"><font color="#808080"><font size=+1>India
seems to be the country most heavily populated by vampires. Lets start
with the Baital. This vampire race was short in stature, only standing
one and a half meters tall. But, height was not the only thing that had
set this species apart; it seems that the Baital was half man and half
bat.</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="CAC Saxon Bold,Courier New"><font color="#808080"><font size=+1>The
Bhuta, from Indian Mythology is the soul of a man who died an untimely
death, usually violent in nature. This is an ill-intentioned spirit that
wandered around at night animating dead bodies and attacking the living
like a ghoul. They can also be found in cemeteries or other deserted places,
feeding on excretion and intestines. An attack by one of these creatures
would usually result in severe sickness or death. The Bhuta also have a
problem that they lack shadows and therefore cannot settle on the earth.</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="CAC Saxon Bold,Courier New"><font color="#808080"><font size=+1>The
Rakshasa was a powerful Indian vampire and magician. They like to confuse
those around them by appearing either in human form with animal attributes
(claws, fangs, slitted eyes, etc.) or as animals with human features (feet,
hands, flattened nose, etc.). The animal side is very often a tiger. They
are known to eat the victim’s flesh in addition to drinking their blood.
The Rakshasa are a shape-shifting species of Hindu mythology that were
originally created by the Brahma to protect the sea from those that wanted
to steal the elixir of immortality from it. They lived in Lanka (Ceylon)
and were ruled by Rawana. Later they became identified as demonic creatures
that would often take the shape of a seductive woman and lure men to their
deaths. In other accounts these creatures lived in trees and caused vomiting
and indigestion to those who strayed to close to its domain. It was said
that children would become one of these creatures if they could be induced
to eat human brains. The Rakshasa were no longer human but still possessed
a physical nature, they loved to prey upon the helpless. Another description
of this vampire was a grave wandering, flesh eating, blood-drinking version
of elves sporting fangs and drenched in blood. As you can see there are
several different versions of this vampire, but they were all accepted
as reality by the Hindus who wrote of such a creature in the Vedas. It
was possible to destroy this creature by burning, exposing to sunlight
or exorcism.</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="CAC Saxon Bold,Courier New"><font color="#808080"><font size=+1>Another
evil spirit of Hindu mythology and folklore was the Brahmaparusha. This
vampire-like creature was a head encircled by intestines and carried a
skull from which it drank blood. It was told in folklore that this evil
spirit enjoyed eating humans and it would drink the victims blood through
the skull it carried, then eat the victims brains. Afterward it would wrap
the intestines of the victim around its body to perform a ritual dance.</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="CAC Saxon Bold,Courier New"><font color="#808080"><font size=+1>The
most famous vampire of India is Kali, who had long flowing hair, wore a
garland of corpses or skulls and had four arms. Her temples were located
near cremation grounds. She and the Goddess Durga battled the king of demons
Ruktabija, who could reproduce himself from each drop of blood spilled.
In order to defeat her opponent Kali had to drink all of Ruktabija’s blood
without spilling a drop. She did this, thereby winning the battle. Other
names for Kali were Sara or the Black Goddess, by the Gypsies. Her followers
were called thugs, and practiced thugee, these people were eventually held
responsible of ritual murders in her name.</font></font></font></b>

all beings of mischief. It is seen at night in cemeteries and places of

eaters. They are described as evil ghouls that were created by the vices
of humankind. Although its attitude is generally not human friendly, it
will cure diseases if enticed to do so. Its favorite pass-time is the consumption
of human flesh. Also included in this species is the Mmbyu (death), it
was considered the chief of all malevolent creatures. They were vampires
of a demonic nature who torment their victims through demonic possessions.</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="CAC Saxon Bold,Courier New"><font color="#808080"><font size=+1>The
Vetala of India was also called Punyaiama, meaning pure race, as in the
Veda. It looks like an old woman, which was deformed with long slits for
eyes, discolored skin, poison fingernails and was known for canabalism.
It sucks the blood of sleeping, drunken or mad women. It would enter the
home by passing a magic thread down the chimney of the home. The Vetala
also had the ability to possess corpses. These corpses would have their
hands and feet pointing backwards.</font></font></font></b>

When he returns the Gayal reeks his revenge upon the sons of others and
upon his own relatives. The threat of a relative returning from the grave
is usually enough to ensure that proper burial rite are performed.</font></font></font></b>
