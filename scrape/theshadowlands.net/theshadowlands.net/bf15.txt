Bigfoot Sighting in China


On Sunday, June 29, 2003, a journalist and five companions spotted the
legendary creature in China's Shennongjia Nature Reserve.  The vehicle
carrying the six witnesses was making a turn when a tall, ape-like animal
with black, shoulder-length hair crossed the road.  12" footprints and
several broken branches were found near the road.  A patch of liquid thought
to be the Bigfoot's urine was also found at the scene.
