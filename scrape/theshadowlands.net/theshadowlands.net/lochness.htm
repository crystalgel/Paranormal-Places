Nessie:</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#FFFFFF">During the summer
of 1999 Dan Scot Taylor, after completing his new submarine 'Nessa', will
return to Loch Ness in hope of finishing what he began 30 years earlier.
The project began in 1969 when Dan arrived at Loch Ness with his submarine
'Viperfish' in search of the Loch Ness Monster. Due to circumstances Dan
was unable to complete his search.</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;Dan has
spent months building a new and improved submarine in hopes of locating
the famed Loch Ness Monster." 'Nessa' will be faster and bigger than Viperfish
- 40 ft long and 30 tons. She will have sonar and powerful lights for underwater
photography" says Taylor. Dan Taylor has sunk more than $200,000 into this
project. He hopes someone will want to film the search or use the sub as
part of a research expedition. During the search if he manages to find
Nessie, Dan plans on trying to obtain a skin sample.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Dan has been trying to contact the necessary officials to inform the appropriate
Government departments of his arrival, hopefully this summer. - by John

<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#FFFFFF">LONDON (CNN) --
A mysterious object in Scotland's Loch Ness has been sighted once more.
Sixteen people watched late Thursday as an unidentifiable object skimmed
along just below the water's surface at high speed for five minutes, then
disappeared.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#FFFFFF">The wake was first
spotted by Kate Munro, joint owner of a hotel on the lake called the Craigdarroch
House. She alerted her husband and 14 guests, who watched the object until
it sank back into the lake.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#FFFFFF">Whatever it was,
witnesses said, it was big enough to leave a whitewater wake the size of
a cruiser's. Lacking a better explanation, several of the witnesses said
they believe they saw the legendary Loch Ness Monster skimming the surface
of the lake.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#FFFFFF">"I cannot find
a rational explanation for what I saw," said English tourist David Neeld.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#FFFFFF">"There were a
few locals in the hotel's bar and they said it was Nessie, so I will go
along with that," he said. "I must say that I was very impressed."</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#FFFFFF">Another tourist,
Karen Hemingway, said, "Whatever we saw was certainly quite strange. There
were no boats around at all. I think I could well have seen the monster."</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#FFFFFF">Sightings of "Nessie,"
as the monster has been nicknamed, have been reported since the 15th century.
It is often described as having a long neck and a large body like a brontosaurus.
Despite several scientific expeditions in the loch, nothing has been found.</font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#FFFFFF">Nevertheless,
about 2 million tourists visit Loch Ness each year because of the monster
legend.</font></font></b>
