<BR><B>By&nbsp; Bernard W. Kelly Sr. (bernard@theshadowlands.net)</B>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;

<P><B>Puerto Rico is a commonwealth of the United States Of America.&nbsp;
Its golden&nbsp;</B>&nbsp;
<BR><B>sun and white beaches have enticed tourist for years to this vacation&nbsp;</B>&nbsp;
<BR><B>paradise. Just off the coast of the state of Florida. It is a short
airplane&nbsp;</B>&nbsp;
<BR><B>flight to this Island of delight.</B>&nbsp;

<P><B>In September of 1995, the first sighting occurred when Madeleine
Tolentino&nbsp;</B>&nbsp;
<BR><B>and other eyewitness described what has become known as the El Chupacabra
or&nbsp;</B>&nbsp;
<BR><B>the Goat Sucker in English. The eyewitnesses described the creature
as being&nbsp;</B>&nbsp;
<BR><B>a cross between a kangaroo and pop-culture conception of a “Gray.”
Its height&nbsp;</B>&nbsp;
<BR><B>was about 4 feet tall with a large head, a lip less mouth, fangs
and lid less&nbsp;</B>&nbsp;
<BR><B>red eyes. Its body was small and it had scrawny clawed arms and
webbed bat&nbsp;</B>&nbsp;
<BR><B>wings and muscular hind legs that appeared to be shaped for leaping.</B>&nbsp;

<P><B>Michael Negron a student at a local university said “I was looking
off the&nbsp;</B>&nbsp;
<BR><B>balcony one night, and I saw it step out of a bright light in the
back yard.&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>&nbsp;
<BR><B>It was three or four feet tall, with skin like that of a dinosaur,
it had&nbsp;</B>&nbsp;
<BR><B>bright eyes the size of hens eggs, long fangs and multicolored spikes
down&nbsp;</B>&nbsp;
<BR><B>its head and back.”</B>&nbsp;

<P><B>The predatory habits of the Chupacabra have always been toward livestock
such&nbsp;</B>&nbsp;
<BR><B>as Chickens, Rabbits, Goats and other small backyard livestock.
IT kills its&nbsp;</B>&nbsp;
<BR><B>prey through a single hole, which all of he blood is then removed
from the&nbsp;</B>&nbsp;
<BR><B>body. To date no humans have been killed by this creature even though
many&nbsp;</B>&nbsp;
<BR><B>have attempted to trap the creature over the years.</B>&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;

<P><B>In March 1996 the Spanish - language talk show Christina, aired the
story&nbsp;</B>&nbsp;
<BR><B>about the El Chupacabra, and immediately following the airing of
the show&nbsp;</B>&nbsp;
<BR><B>there was an explosion of sightings from Mexico and the United States.</B>&nbsp;

<P><B>The El Chupacabra although seen by many has never been photograph
and to this&nbsp;</B>&nbsp;
<BR><B>day we have nothing but the eyewitness accounts and artist renderings.</B>&nbsp;

<P><B>Could so many eyewitnesses, be so wrong?</B>&nbsp;

<P><B>This a artists drawing of what the Goatsuckers look like based on
witness's testimony.&nbsp;</B> <B>It's a Humanoid&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
approximately four feet tall and</B> <B>seventy pounds. It&nbsp; also has
clawed hands and</B> <B>large, powerful hind legs like a kangaroo's. Has
fangs and large red eyes. It kills goats, rabbits, cats and other small
animals, leaving a single bite mark through which it sucks its victim's&nbsp;
blood.&nbsp; It was first sighted in Puerto Rico in 1975.&nbsp; There are

<B>Header: DID GOATSUCKER STRIKE TAMPA BEFORE MIAMI?</B></H3>
<B>by Bill Duryea, Times Staff Writer</B>&nbsp;

<P><B>Body of Text: Tampa -- The discovery of a dead goat in a yard full
of big</B> <B>dogs is not normally the stuff of which mysteries are made.</B>
<B>But if you add in the fact that the goat had suspicious puncture marks
in</B> <B>the neck, and that there was nary a drop of blood, and that the
goat had been</B> <B>lifelong friends with the dogs, then it becomes more
difficult to ignore a</B> <B>more sinister conclusion: This is the work
of the <A HREF="http://www.princeton.edu/~accion/chupa14.html">chupacabras</A>.
Literally</B> <B>translated: the goatsucker.</B> <B>And it may well have
struck in Tampa.</B> <B>For years, this vampire-like predator -- with its
fangs, red eyes and</B> <B>spiked back -- was known only in Puerto Rico.
Legend had it that it prowled</B> <B>the central mountains, gruesomely
dispatching goats in a way that no earthly</B> <B>animal could possibly
accomplish.</B>&nbsp; <B>Then, last month, 69 goats, chickens, geese and
ducks were found</B> <B>slaughtered in a yard in a heavily Hispanic neighborhood
of south Miami.</B> <B>Well, add Millie the white goat to the roll call
of the dead.</B> <B>One Sunday two months ago, weeks before the Miami massacre,
an employees</B> <B>of Select Seafood in Drew Park arrived at work to find
one of the company's</B>&nbsp;
<BR><B>two goats dead.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>The watchdogs -- Spike and Bear
-- became obvious suspects. Dogs are the</B> <B>leading suspects among
skeptics in Miami.</B> <B>But Danny Rivera, the assistant plant manager
of Select and native of</B> <B>Puerto Rico, had another explanation, one
that drew on the folklore of his youth.</B>&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>"They though
I was crazy when I started talking about it," River, 25,</B> <B>said.</B>
<B>"But the Haitians (workers) agreed," said John Gasser, owner of Select</B>&nbsp;
<BR><B>Seafood.</B>&nbsp; <B>The man who found the goat "doesn't believe
in the <A HREF="http://www.princeton.edu/~accion/chupa14.html">chupacabras</A>,"
Gasser</B> <B>said. "But he couldn't explain the lack of blood."</B> <B>What
could have spawned such a monstrosity? Rivera doesn't like to think</B>
<B>it, but it's hard to avoid.</B> <B>"Government experiments."</B>&nbsp;

<TD><B>Chupacabras Update</B>
<BR><B>by Scott Corrales Note: Scott's latest book, "Chupacabras and other
Mysteries," Greenleaf Publications, ISBN 1-883729-06-8, Introduction by
Marc Davenport, can be acquired by calling by calling the Publisher at
1 800 905-8367 November 11, 1997 After a prolonged absence during which
it was missed by no one (except for the Gargoyle-worshiping cult which
frequents the Cabo Rojo lighthouse), the Chupacabras left its calling card
yesterday morning at the "Granja Marina" farm in the municipality of Lo-za
Aldea's Barrio San Isidro. According to police reports, the alleged slayer
killed two goats, bled dry another four and even managed to steal a young
kid. Police colonel Carmelo Correa, who acceded to talk to reporter Tom
s de Jess Mangual of the EL VOCERO tabloid, stated that the Goatsucker's
repeat performance would have taken place around two'o clock in the morning
on Monday. When Jess Betato, an immigrant from the Dominican Republic who
works as the farm's steward, heard what he described as a "flutter of wings"
at that time of night, he claims he saw three horses and fifty-eight cows
who were in a fenced are "run as if the devil were in pursuit." It was
then that the cries of the goats could be heard in the tropical darkness.
Betato headed straight for the goat pens accompanied by his dog. We can
imagine his bemusement when the dog -- a Dalmatian -- made a sudden "about
face" and broke into a furious run in the opposite direction, tail between
its legs. Taking a clue from the animal's behavior, Betato prudently returned
to the farmhouse and waited for daybreak before returning to the site.
In the dawn's early light, Betato was faced by the dead and wounded goats,
discovering that two of the animals had deep "puncture marks" on the right
side of their throats. "Granja Marina" is the property of Loizan landowner
Carlos Ortiz, who requested that the police and related agencies redouble
their efforts in finding the ever-elusive culprit. Ortiz knows, perhaps
better than most people, what the Chupacabras can do: he lost thirty ducks
to the unknown predator back in 1995. November 17, 1997 The Chupacabras
has developed a taste for "the other white meat"-- pork. According to a
report by Police colonel Mariano Aponte, police chief of the Arecibo, P.R.
area, thirty four hogs were found dead with strange puncture marks on their
necks through which blood was extracted. The pigs were being raised by
the inmates of the Sabana Hoyos penal camp, who had planned to eat them
for Christmas. The Chupacabras had other plans. Jesus Rodr-guez Rosario,
an officer with the Department of Corrections, reported to work at 7:00
a.m. as was his custom and came across the 34 slain animals. Police reports
indicated that the Department of Natural Resources, which had been active
during the Chupacabras' original outbreak two years ago, had been called
in on the investigation to contribute its expertise. Perhaps the saddest
cut of all --no pun intended-- was that inmates were forced to bury the
bloodless carcasses of what would otherwise have become a fine holiday
feast. Talk about dashed hopes... November 24, 1997 News of the Chupacabras's
disappearance cast a pall over the moods of small landowners and farmers,
who had been looking forward to a peaceful beginning to the holiday season.
Rather than sitting back and enjoying the fruits of their labor, it was
now time to return to the state of alert which had frayed their nerves
two years ago. One farmer, Roberto Rivera Garc-a, told newspapers: "Those
of us who believed that the murderer of our animals, the Goatsucker, had
disappeared for good and were therefore more at ease, have been fooled
-- he only took a protracted vacation." News of the loss a herd of pigs
at Arecibo's Sabana Hoyos prison camp spread like wildfire across the island,
rekindling the old fears. Mayor Jos "Chemo" Soto Has a Role in Clint Eastwood's
Chupacabras Movie by Mabel M. Figueroa -- Primera Hora Wednesday, November
19, 1997 IT WILL NO LONGER BE "Live from Hollywood"; From now on, it'll
be "Live from Canvanas": it turns out that a group of eight investors from
the United States, including renowned actor Clint Eastwood, have already
purchased 160 acres in the municipality of Canvanas for the construction
of a film school. According to Canvanas mayor Jos "Chemo" Soto, investors
were attracted to Puerto Rico by a producer interested in making a movie
on the strange "Chupacabras" creature that decimated hundreds of animals
a year ago and has returned to the scene only weeks ago. Soto explained
that the film school shall be near a shopping center whose construction
is planned on State Highway #3 starting in January. It will be a unique
project in the Caribbean, boasting 119 stores and a four-star hotel. "It's
an entire package -- recording, cinematography, moviemaking, the whole
works. They already have a model and have submitted the plans for approval.
Not only are they bringing the film school, but are also making arrangements
to purchase other properties and build some mansions to develop an exclusive
area," observed Soto. How's filming of the Chupacabras movie going? "It's
already underway, and I have a role in the movie." Are you playing the
Chupacabras' co-star? "No." What role are you playing in the film? "I'm
playing the role of "Chemo," mayor of Canvanas, who became interested in
a problem affecting his municipality." Do you have a script? "Yes, I already
have it. It's in my office (town hall) and its huge." Do you like being
a Hollywood actor? "I'll tell you. I've been an actor all my life. That
area has always been of interest to me and I have the talent for being
an actor. It's not that I'm burning to be an actor, either." Will your
role be a prominent one? In other words, will you have a lot of screen
time? "You can currently see a number of documentaries in which I've played
a of screen time? "You can currently see a number of documentaries in which
I've played a part and you can see how I'm portrayed in a number of occasions."
Does it bother you to be known as "Chemo Jones"? "No, not at all. Sometimes
they'll call me "Chemo Jones", sometimes they'll call me "Chupacabras".
It's all in a day's work." Do you have anything to thank the Chupacabras
for? "Nothing at all." Not even the celebrity you've gotten in Canovanas
and the fact that you are now a Hollywood actor? "I didn't get this celebrity
through the Chupacabras, only because the event happened, thank God (the
Chupacabras phenomenon). The Chupacabras exists and I treat the matter
seriously from the moment that the creature started killing animals in
Canovanas, and it was possible that it might end up killing a person. They
said on radio that I was going to build a monument to the Chupacabras,
but that's not true. What I did say is that a study should be made to find
out what was going on." Have you ever had nightmares about the Chupacabras?
"Never." Have you ever had good dreams about the Chupacabras? "Neither."
Would you like to meet the Chupacabras? "That I would like to do. To see
it or to be present if we ever manage to capture it." Why? "Because it's
like a mystery." Is it a dream or goal in your life? "No." Is it an obsession,
perhaps? "Neither. I'm telling you -- it's like a veil of mystery that
fell upon our people. Whatever it is, whether animal or extraterrestrial,
it created a such level of hysteria in my town that people took notice,
and the panic among the population caused the subject to become part of
my mayoral agenda. Do you care what people think about you regarding this
matter? "The people in my community are clear about it. Those who have
suffered the loss of their animals and who have seen the Chupacabras know
that it's "The people in my community are clear about it. Those who have
suffered the loss of their animals and who have seen the Chupacabras know
that it's real." But aren't you upset by the taunts of others? "No, that's
how it's always going to be. People lack an awareness of the matter; they
will always laugh. But if they took it upon themselves to interview those
who have suffered, lost animals or seen the Chupacabras, they would be
shaken out of their "mental innocence."? <FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">This article
