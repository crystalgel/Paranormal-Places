significance?</FONT></FONT></B></CENTER>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Have you ever had a dream that was truly
non-sequitor, and wondered 'where</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">in the world did THAT come from?'&nbsp;
Then, you looked it up in your trusty</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">little dream dictionary, and found
that it meant something that made</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">absolutely no sense at all?&nbsp; Yeah,
me to.</FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">This is why, I must admit, I have a
serious problem with "Dream</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Dictionaries", and people who interpret
the dreams of others.&nbsp; Here's why;</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">how can anyone evaluate the intensely
personal symbolism of another?&nbsp; For</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">instance, I've read in quite a few
dictionaries that the presence of water</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">symbolizes something buried deep in
the subconscious.&nbsp; This may be true for</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">some.&nbsp; But what if the person
falls asleep thinking about the trip to the</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">beach they are taking soon.&nbsp; Then,
they have a dream of deep sea fishing.</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">What then?&nbsp; That definition obviously
wouldn't work in this case.&nbsp; Not to</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">mention the fact that different dictionaries
give you different meanings</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">for the SAME DREAM!</FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Most dreams are nothing more than your
subconscious mind running amuck.</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">We've all had at least one disturbing
dream that really bothered us, and</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">have wondered "Ohmygod, am I nuts!?!".&nbsp;
No, you're not nuts.&nbsp; For instance,</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">everyone at some point has had an incest
dream.&nbsp; Freud would have you</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">believe that you are suppressing some
sort of animalistic urge.</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">(Personally, I think the entire basis
of Freud's work was merely an attempt</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">to justify his own psychotic tendencies-but
that's just me.)&nbsp; Just because</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">you dream about something that is considered
immoral, does not mean that</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">you secretly wish it to happen.&nbsp;
It's just a dream, it means NOTHING!&nbsp; So</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">don't worry, you're not nuts.</FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">I remember having some really weird
dreams when I was 6 or 7 years old,</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">right after seeing the movie "Yellow
Submarine".&nbsp; For weeks, I dreamed I</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">was Oblio, stuck in strange "bad acid
trip universe" and couldn't find my</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">way back to my parents.&nbsp; It didn't
mean that I secretly felt unwanted, it</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">just restimulated a fear of loss.&nbsp;
There was no basis in reality for it at</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">all.</FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">So how DO you make sense of these nocturnal
goings-on?&nbsp; There are different</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">kinds of dreams.&nbsp; And some of
them aren't dreams at all.&nbsp; Say a person is</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">trying to work something out, they
fall asleep thinking about it, and when</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">they wake up the next morning, they
have an answer.&nbsp; Does this mean they</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">worked it out in their dreams?&nbsp;
Not really.&nbsp; When you are asleep, only the</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">body is asleep.&nbsp; Your mind does
not sleep.&nbsp; It's going 24 hours a day, 7</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">days a week.&nbsp; So you may have
worked it out in your sleep, but it was not a</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">dream.&nbsp; You may have even looked
at pictures of different scenarios while</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">you were sleeping, to come up with
a solution, but that's not a dream.</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">That's you working out a solution while
your body sleeps.</FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Some people have out of body experiences
during the night, and wake up</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">thinking they had a really cool dream.&nbsp;
For instance, one night, I dreamed</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">that I was walking through a neighborhood
I lived in, in Houston, when I</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">was little.&nbsp; I walked all through
the streets of this neighborhood noticing</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">how much it had changed.&nbsp; I hadn't
lived in or visited this city for more</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">than eleven years.&nbsp; As luck would
have it, about 6 months later, a friend</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">and I drove to Houston for the weekend.&nbsp;
I drove through this neighborhood,</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">and WHAM!&nbsp; The dream came back
to me.&nbsp; (I had long since forgotten about</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">it) The neighborhood looked exactly
as it did in the dream.&nbsp; For those of</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">you who aren't familiar with Houston,
it changes drastically on almost a</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">daily basis, it expands so fast!&nbsp;
So I wasn't "remembering" what it looked</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">like.&nbsp; Besides, in the dream,
I saw my old house, and when I lived in it,</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">there was a Weeping Willow tree in
the front yard.&nbsp; In my dream it wasn't</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">there.&nbsp; When I saw the house on
this trip, you guessed it, no Weeping</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Willow tree.</FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">There is also past life recall.&nbsp;
Say you're visiting Louisiana, and as</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">you're driving, you pass a beautiful
pre-civil war mansion.&nbsp; You slow down,</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">can't take your eyes off of it, there
is SOMETHING about this house!&nbsp; You</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">keep driving, thinking you probably
saw it in a movie or book and forget</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">all about it.&nbsp; That night, you
have a dream about that mansion.&nbsp; Only it's</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">a different color than you remember.&nbsp;
The trees are smaller and fewer,</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">there is a big field off to the left
of the house and you see cotton and</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">sugar cane growing.&nbsp; You wake
up the next morning thinking that it was a</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">nice dream, and you decide to pick
up a book in the hotel gift shop on</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">civil war era southern architecture.&nbsp;
You flip through the book, and you</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">come upon a picture of that same house.&nbsp;
Only this picture of the home,</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">circa 1870, LOOKS EXACTLY AS IT DID
IN YOUR DREAM!</FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">There are also re-curring dreams.&nbsp;
This means you have the same dream over</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">and over.&nbsp; There can be some significance
to this.&nbsp; It could be as simple</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">as.......you're a fan of re-runs!&nbsp;
No, I'm kidding.&nbsp; Seems to me, you're</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">trying to work something out, and for
whatever reason, it's not happening.</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Like being stuck on the fence.&nbsp;
You can't decide whether or not to take</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">that job in another city, or whatever
"either/or" situation you're</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">wrestling with.&nbsp; When you make
a decision, the dreams will probably stop.</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">(Also, sometimes these "re-runs" are
caused by some kind of fear of</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">something or someone you're not consciously
aware of, and as soon as you</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">confront it, the dreams stop.)</FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">There is also what I call "Going through
a crappy time" dream.&nbsp; This tends</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">to happen when you're, duh, going through
a crappy time.&nbsp; Like you just</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">lost your job, or just got dumped,
or moved to new town and you don't know</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">anyone.&nbsp; You have really creative
dreams.&nbsp; They're usually quite nice.</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">I've always considered them "nocturnal
entertainment".&nbsp; However, if you</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">feel they are more than just entertaining,
read on......</FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">So how do you tell the difference between
"just a dream" and something</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">significant, and figure out what they
mean?</FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">You know when you wake up from a dream,
different parts of it will stick</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">out in your mind?&nbsp; These are,
for the most part, the significant symbols.</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">For instance, you dream you and your
best friend are riding bicycles in a</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">park.&nbsp; When you wake up, you think,
"Why were we riding bicycles?"&nbsp; Seems</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">to me the bicycle is significant to
you in that dream, because that is what</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">caught your attention.&nbsp; It wasn't
the pink dancing bears, or talking pine</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">trees, or frosty the snowman waving
at the two of you, it was the bicycles</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">that grabbed your attention.&nbsp;
So there is one thing you can do; figure out</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">what grabbed your attention.&nbsp;
I've always found it best to write it down,</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">because I'm one of those people who
forget what they were dreaming about as</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">soon as they throw their clock radio
across the room!&nbsp; Keep a notebook by</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">your bed, and as soon as you wake up,
write down everything you can</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">remember about your dreams.&nbsp; After
a while, you'll start to see a pattern,</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">and from that pattern you'll be able
to see what is significant, and what</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">is just a "subconscious mind party".</FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">How do you define your own symbolism?&nbsp;
You take what grabbed your</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">attention, and find the meaning.&nbsp;
For instance, let's take the bicycle.</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">We've decided that it's the one thing
that grabbed your attention in that</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">dream.&nbsp; A bicycle is hard to learn
when you're a little kid.&nbsp; But you</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">mastered it.&nbsp; So whatever is on
your mind now, you'll master as well.&nbsp; Or,</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">a bicycle is a relatively simple machine,
it's time to simplify your life.</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">You can travel by bicycle, it's time
to take that trip.&nbsp; A bicycle has 2</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">wheels, maybe you should get that front-end
alignment you've been meaning</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">to get on your car.&nbsp; Obviously,
the possibilities are as endless as they</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">are personal!</FONT></B><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica"></FONT></B>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">And this is the problem I have with
dream dictionaries.&nbsp; This is PERSONAL</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">symbolism!&nbsp; You can't make an
evaluation like this for another person.</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">What is true for one person is not
necessarily true for another.&nbsp; (I know</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">If I had that dream, I would have wondered
about those pink dancing</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">bears!;)&nbsp; I'm not saying these
dictionaries are evil.&nbsp; I'm saying not to</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">take them TOO seriously.&nbsp; If you
have one that works well for you, great.</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">You don't need to throw it out.&nbsp;
Just remember that if a definition doesn't</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">feel true for you, then it's not.</FONT></B>
