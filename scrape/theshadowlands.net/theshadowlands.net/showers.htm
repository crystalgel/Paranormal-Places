<TD><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">You ask how things that don't live
in the sky fall from the sky? Well, of course, they can't. But strange
and mysterious falls have been happening forever. There have been bizarre
accounts of organic as well as inorganic matter falling from the sky such
as frogs, fish, snakes, mussels, worms, alligators, blood and flesh, straw,
hazelnuts, slime, stones, artifacts, and many other materials to numerous
to add.&nbsp;</FONT></B>

<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Yes, it is true that storms can pick
up things and drop them somewhere else, but storms don't work in the eerie
way that things have been falling. For example, fish fall by themselves
and with no other weeds, mud or pond fauna as should happen when a waterspout
dumps on land. Because of this, few dispute the occurrence of strange showers,
which are by far the most enigmatic of events that happen in nature.</FONT></B>

<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">One of the strangest of all mysterious
showers are the falls of flesh and blood. Most people who see showers of
blood are mistaken by red dust falling with the rain. But in some cases,
according to eyewitness accounts, they claim actual blood and flesh did
fall from the sky. These occurrences usually happen in brief time and small
areas but are incredible. Some people may not find this mysterious phenomenon
as interesting as the enigmas of the loch ness monster or bigfoot just
because the thought of something like that happening is just plain alarming
and terrifying.</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">&nbsp;</FONT></B>
<BR><B><FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Some researchers and writers have tried
to come up with their own answers on how these events occur such as the
teleportation of objects from one area to another or evidence of alien
life, but no one really has any idea on how these strange showers occur
so until further evidence is found will stay one of the earths baffling
mysteries.&nbsp;</FONT></B></TD>
