artist carved 3 animals in the archway of the Ishtar Gate in Babylon.&nbsp;
The three animals were a lion, an wild ox and the sirrush.&nbsp; Why was

Was it because it wasn't a myth?&nbsp; The&nbsp; sirrush was described
as slender bodied, scale covered creature with a&nbsp; horn atop it's head.&nbsp;
Nebuchadnezzar was the king of Babylonia at the time and The Bible mentions
that his priests kept a great dragon or serpent that they worshipped.&nbsp;
The creature closely resembles a type of dinosaur, a sauropod.&nbsp; Since
the Babylonians did not have the ability to reconstruct fossil remains
it is more likely they were drawing a living animal that they has seen.&nbsp;
The drawings and carvings of the sirrush were always the same and never

<center><a name="lizard"></a><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#ffffff"><font size="+2">Lizard
Men</font></font></font></b></center>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#ffffff">One of the most bizarre
creatures reported in recent times is undoubtedly a nightmarish entity
from South Carolina, which has been aptly nicknamed Lizard Man. According
to eyewitnesses, it walks on its hind legs, stands just over 7 feet tall,
and has glowing red eyes and green scaly skin. It has only three toes on
each foot and three fingers on each hand, but every toe and every finger
has a 4-inch long black claw at its tip. Lizard Man first made its presence
felt at around 2 A.M. on June 29, 1988. This was when 17-year-old Christopher
Davis was changing a flat tire on his car near Scape Ore Swamp, which is
just outside the backwater village of Bishopville in South Carolina's Lee
County. Chris was placing the jack into his car boot when he spied something
very large running on its hind legs towards him, across a field close by.
As it drew near, Chris jumped inside his car and tried to slam the door
shut, but the horrifying reptile-man seized it from the other side, gripping
the mirror as it attempted to wrench the door open! And when Chris tried
to escape by accelerating hard, his scaly attacker jumped on to the car's
roof! Luckily, it soon fell off as the vehicle sped away. When Chris arrived
home he was trembling with fear, the roof of his car bore a series of long
scratches and the wing mirror was severely twisted. The massive media publicity
generated by this incident led to many other Lizard Man reports emerging
during the summer of 1988, but the same could not be said for Lizard Man
itself, who eventually disappeared without ever having been satisfactorily
explained. Interestingly, this bizarre episode is far from being unique.
Long before Chris Davis's frightening experience, many other parts of North
America had also hosted encounters with reptilian man-monsters, astonishingly
similar in appearance to the amphibious "gillman" starring in Hollywood's
classic Creature from the Black Lagoon movie. On August 19, 1972, for example,
Robin Flewellyn and Gordon Pike were allegedly chased away from the beach
around Thetis Lake in British Columbia, Canada, by a 5 foot tall bipedal
monster with six sharp points on its head, which had unexpectedly surfaced
in the lake. Four days later, at around 3:30 P.M. on August 23, Russell
Van Nice and Michael Gold could only watch in amazement when what was presumably
the same creature suddenly stepped out of the lake, looked around and then
walked back into the water, disappearing from sight. According to their
description, it was humanoid in shape, but with scaly silver skin, huge
ears, the face of a monster and a pointed projection on its head. In 1977,
a State Conservation naturalist called Alfred Hulstruck claimed that a
scale-covered man-beast regularly emerged at dusk from the red algae-choked
waters of Southern Tier in New York State. Five years earlier, in March
1972, two policemen saw a frogfaced humanoid creature, about the size of
a dog, plunge into Little Miami River near Loveland, Ohio. In this same
area, back in 1955, a respectable businessman claimed that he had seen
a quartet of 3 foot tall, frog-faced creatures squatting under a bridge
like fairytale trolls. Another longstanding tradition of scaly humanoids
features the fish-men of Inzignanin, near Chicora- an area sandwiched between
North and South Carolina. These beings were said to be covered with scales
and had webbed hands. Most distinctive of all, however, were their tails,
which were as thick as a man's arm, about 18 inches long and relatively
inflexible, like those of crocodiles or alligators. According to local
lore, they lived only on raw fish and therefore soon died out when the
area's fish supplies became exhausted. Equally strange was the 6 foot tall,
fluorescent-eye monster that clawed Charles Wetzel's car on the evening
of November 8, 1958 as he drove by the Santa Ana River near Riverside,
California. Although often placed in the bigfoot category of mystery beasts,
it was much more akin to the reptilian monsters, as noted by the writer
Loren Coleman, because it was covered in leaf-like scales and had a protrusible
beak-like mouth. Needless to say, no real-life creatures of the "Black
Lagoon" variety have ever been proven by science to exist on earth, either
during the present or the past. Yet, if the course of evolution had taken
a different turn, our planet may indeed have been home to life forms of
this type. In 1982, the scientific journal Syllogeus published a very unusual
but highly original paper by two well-respected Canadian paleontologists,
Dr. Dale A. Russell and Dr. R. Seguin from the National Museum of Natural
Sciences in Ottawa. Its subject was the fascinating possibility that, if
the dinosaurs had never died out, they would have eventually given rise
to a dinosaurian counterpart of human beings. In their paper, Russell and
Seguin speculated about the likely appearance of such a creature and suggested
that it would have stood upright on its hind legs, with three fingers on
each hand. They even constructed a model of this &#8216;dinosaur man' and what
is so amazing about it is that in overall appearance it is remarkably similar
to the descriptions of Lizard Man and other reptilian man-beasts reported
from modern-day North America!</font></font></b>

<center><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#ffffff"><font size="+2">What
is the Yowie?</font></font></font></b></center>


<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#ffffff">There has been
much written in by scientists, natural history researchers,cryptozooligists,historians
and collectors of fokelore, about the elusive "Yowie".&nbsp; Just where
does all of this come from.&nbsp; Many</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#ffffff">Aboriginal groups
from around Australia have oral traditions that date back thousands of
years.&nbsp; Included in much of their lore are Dreaming stories concerning
large, often black giants.&nbsp; Many of their stories contain references
to long extinct megafauna.&nbsp; Diprotodons, marsupial lions, giants</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#ffffff">wombats, giant
red kangaroos, just to name a few.</font></font></b>

</p><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#ffffff">Many of these
animals died out when the climate changed.&nbsp; Others succumbed to the
predations of humans, particularly when they introduced the wide spread
use of fire as a hunting and environment altering tool.&nbsp; Along with
humans came the dingo about 10000 years ago, the introduction of this animal
and its impact on native fauna cannot be underestimated. Yet other evolved
down into their more compact modern forms.</font></font></b>

</p><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#ffffff">Many people mistakinly
believe that Aboriginal people have always occupied all parts of Australia.&nbsp;
THIS IS NOT SO!&nbsp; Different parts of the continent were occupied at
different times, and there were at least 3 waves of aboriginal people who
migrated down through the south eastern parts of Australia.&nbsp; I use
the example of the indigenous people of Tasmania. Tasmania had been cut
off from the Australian mainland for at least 5000 years before settlement.
The people who lived on the island prior to 1788 were different.</font></font></b>

</p><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#ffffff">Contrary to popular
opinion they were not wiped out by early European settlers.&nbsp; The survivors
who took refuge on off shore islands are descended from a people whose,
language, culture and physical appearance was distinct from the Aboriginal
people at the time of settlement in 1788.&nbsp; Their culture</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#ffffff">and tools were
very much like those of the people whose cultural remnants have been found
on Kangaroo Island off the coast of South Australia.&nbsp; The last known
indigenous inhabitants disappeared some 5000 years ago.&nbsp; The physical
evidence is further enhanced by the discoveries made in the Lower Murray
Valley at a place called Tartanga.&nbsp; Found in a grave on an island
in</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#ffffff">the river was
the body of a Tasmanian.&nbsp; Further archaeological evidence suggests
that the original inhabitants of the Lower Murray Valley were directly
related to the Tasmanian people, and were either driven out or intermarried
with later waves of Aboriginal people who moved down the valley.</font></font></b>

</p><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#ffffff">Why go through
all of this to try to explain the origins of the Yowie?&nbsp; As already
mentioned Australia was a land of giants long before its current state.&nbsp;
The land was much greener in many places, particularly in the 'Dead Heart',
10000 years ago that all changed.&nbsp; Historical records from around</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#ffffff">the world state
that in many places indigenous peoples were generally larger than many
who migrated to those areas.&nbsp; Remember we are talking about eons of
existence in one place.&nbsp; As the climate of the world changed, many
people migrated, animals and plants evolved into smaller forms of themselves.
If animals did, why couldn't humans?</font></font></b>

</p><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#ffffff">The Kaurna people
of the Adelaide Plains have a story that records the flooding of the Gulf,
this occurred over 5000 years prior to today.&nbsp; They also have stories
that cover their migration form central Australia.&nbsp; The language of
the Kaurna people whilst distinct traces its origins back to the</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#ffffff">central desert
of Australia.&nbsp; It shares a common root with Pitjantjatjarra.&nbsp;
The Kaurna people migrated south when the climate changed, along the way
they fragmented into different groups who occupied different geographical
regions . This way those who migrated from central Australia became The</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#ffffff">Kaurna, the Peramangk,
the Ngadjuri, the Narranga, the Adnyamathanah, the Nauo and the Nukunu.&nbsp;
When the Kaurna arrived on the plains they encoutered a people who were
different to themselves.&nbsp; The people resembled the Tasmanians and
the cultural debris left behind supports this.&nbsp; In many of</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#ffffff">the Kaurna stories
these people fled to the hills.&nbsp; The Kaurna people referred to them
as giants with po!&nbsp;&nbsp; werful magic and sorcery. The Kaurna people
also reffered to a large,hairy giant called a Nookoona.&nbsp; It would
come in the middle of the night, creep up to people as they slept and kill
them very quietly.</font></font></b>

</p><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#ffffff">To explain both
of these Yowie like occurrences we need to look at the historical evidence.&nbsp;
In the languages of the gulf of South Australia the word Yura means both
monster, and man, depending on which group dialect isbeing spoken and in
what context the word is being used.&nbsp; The Aboriginal</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#ffffff">people of the
region would often refer to their enemies in other districts as evil giants
as a way of denigrating them and to instill fear of outsiders into the
young members of their society.&nbsp; The people who lived in the hills
over looking the Adelaide plains were said to be eight foot giants who
would</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#ffffff">kill for pleasure.&nbsp;
The Peramangk people were certainly physically more robust than their cousins
on the plain but this was more to do with their intermarriage with the
people on the far side of the hills than with being primitve neanderthals.&nbsp;
The Peramangk people spoke a similar laguage to the</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#ffffff">Kaurna but had
different religious practices, and were on good terms with the people of
the low!</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#ffffff">&nbsp;er River
Murray, who were mortal enemies of the Kaurna. Thus the Peramangk people
were worthy of fear and respect and became those loathsome giants the Pootpotberrie.</font></font></b>

</p><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#ffffff">The Kaurna people
also had another enemy, the Nukunu.&nbsp; The Nukunu were religious undamentalists
who would often go on punishment raids.&nbsp; This involved killing people
from other groups as a way of punishing them for not strictly following
age old religious customs and practices.&nbsp; The Nukunu way of killing
was to sneak up on a sleeping person and insert a small bone awl (Stilletto),
into the neck just above the hair line' or into the navel, then clean off
the wound.&nbsp; From this developed the Yowie like creature the Nokunna.&nbsp;
From available record it woluld seem reasonable to suggest that the very
first Aboriginal inhabitants of Australia may well have been</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#ffffff">protohuman, homonids
not unlike neanderthalic humans.&nbsp; it may well have been the tasmanian
people who first encountered them and recorded their existence in their
own oral traditions.&nbsp; The tasmanian people were quite small compared
to may of the maniland Aboriginal people, but that does not always mean
they were.&nbsp; When first!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; encountered by lated waves
of migrating people they may well have been proverbial giants who later,
evolved into a smaller version of themselves to</font></font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#ffffff">suit their island
homes.&nbsp; We will never know for sure but it seems a pity that people
are willing to listen to any half baked idea.&nbsp; There has never been
any record of Megahomonids living on this continent.&nbsp; Stone age. Yes!
But never pre- homosapien.&nbsp; The Aboriginal people have been here for
100000 plus years, they should know.&nbsp; Most, if not all of their giant
traditions can traced back to a reliable, and historically accurate source.</font></font></b>

</font><font color="#ffffff" face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><b>A fierce creature found in Australia.&nbsp; The Aboriginal People told 
of the Bunyip in their oral folklore.&nbsp; In the Aboriginal language 
Bunyip means spirit or devil.&nbsp; However, in today's language it means 
bogey.<br>
Perhaps this is an early version of the bogeyman.&nbsp; Either way, 
the Bunyip is a featured creature in Children's Literature in 
Australia.<br>
<br>
It is hard to describe the creature as the Aboriginal People 
gave different descriptions of the creature.&nbsp; It has been described as 
a large, hairy, semi-aquatic creature with the head of a horse; as 
a creature with a hippo size body and the features of a dog; and as having 
long jet-black hair, shiny, without a tail and large ears.&nbsp; While other 
reports indicate that only the head has been seen because it's only been 
spotted in the water.<br>
<br>
The Oxford Companion to Australian Literature 
defines a Bunyip as "a monster of Aboriginal mythology with a huge body 
covered with fur .&nbsp; said to live in swamps, lagoons, and billabongs from which 
it emerges on moonlit nights to prey on humans, especially women and 
children."<br>
<br>
We know the Bunyip has been around for at least 200 years 
based on the time period of the oral folklore.&nbsp; It is commonly agreed that 
the creatures live in lagoons, swamps, and billabongs and often heard 
by its loud piercing screams.&nbsp; Also, it is said that women are 
their favorite prey.&nbsp; The disagreements surround the description and 
the behavior of the creatures.&nbsp; It is also implied that the 
Bunyip searches out their human prey, however, in the folklore, Bunyip 
only takes human prey if their water habitat is disturbed (it needs 
calm water to survive) or if their food chain is interrupted.<br>
<br>
Most 
would agree that the Bunyip is a myth or story told just to frighten young 
children and women&nbsp; mostly because no one has a clear -description of the 
creature.&nbsp; But think for a minute.&nbsp; Science has<br>
proven repeatedly that 
animals and insects as well as humans adapt to their surroundings.&nbsp; If the 
surroundings of a moth go from colorful to all black or gray because of 
pollution, their physical being<br>
adapts to it's surrounding so that it can 
hide from its hunters. Perhaps this is why there is not a clear description 
of the Bunyip.</b></font><br>

John Roach<br>
for National Geographic News<br>
April 14, 2003<br>
<br>
A mysterious group of apes found in the war-torn Democratic Republic of
Congo in central Africa has scientists and conservationist scratching
their heads. The apes nest on the ground like gorillas but have a diet
and features characteristic of chimpanzees. <br>
The apes are most likely a group of giant chimpanzees that display
gorilla-like behavior. A far more remote possibility is that they
represent a new subspecies of great ape. Researchers plan to return to
the region later this month to collect more clues to help resolve the
mystery. <br>
<br>
The detective story began in 1908 when a Belgian army officer returned
home with several gorilla skulls from near the town of Bili on the Uele
River and gave them to the Belgium's Royal Museum for Central Africa in
Tervuren. In 1927 the museum's curator classified the skulls as a new
subspecies of gorilla, Gorilla gorilla uellensis. <br>
<br>
Intrigued by the subspecies, Colin Groves, now an anthropologist at the
Australian National University in Canberra, examined the skulls in 1970
and determined that they were indistinguishable from western gorillas,
one of the two known species of gorilla. No further specimens of this
gorilla from Bili have since been found. <br>
<br>
In 1996, Swiss-born, Kenya-based wildlife photographer and
conservationist Karl Ammann embarked on a quest to rediscover the
mysterious gorillas. <br>
<br>
To date, Ammann has not found the gorilla. But he has collected a
wealth of information including skulls, ground nests, hair and fecal
samples, footprints, and, most recently, photographs of what appears to
be a chimpanzee that behaves like a gorilla. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
A remote camera trap captured this shot of a "Bondo mystery ape" in the
Democratic Republic of Congo. Most experts believe the unusual band of
apes are giant chimpanzees that display gorilla-like behavior. One
countervailing theory, however, holds that the band represents a new
subspecies of great ape.<br>
