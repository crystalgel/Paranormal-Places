      <center><b><font size="+2">The Gray Man of Pawley's Island, South
Carolina</font></b></center>
      <center><b>by Charla@theshadowlands.net</b></center>
      <b></b>
      <p><b>Howling winds, torrents of rain, lightening streaking
across the
sky and the night black as the deepest hole that will consume even the
most devout.&nbsp; This is what the Gray Man warns is coming when he
meets
you on the dunes of the beach.&nbsp; He no longer needs to issue the
warning
verbally as his mere presence is enough.&nbsp; Who is the Gray Man and
why does he warn of impending storms?</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Unfortunately, the identity of the Gray Man is lost in
folklore.&nbsp;
It has been said he was the founding father of Pawley Island,
Mr.Perceval
Pawley who settled the island and named it.&nbsp; It was his love of
his
island and home that keeps him earthbound.&nbsp;</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Others believe it is the lover of a Charleston Belle that
was sent
away to France because their relationship was not acceptable to their
parents.&nbsp;
Rumor has it that the two were cousins and that the man was a scoundrel
of sorts.&nbsp; The lover vowed to return and make her his wife.&nbsp;
Time passed and it was reported that he had died in a duel.&nbsp; Grief
stricken the woman mourned.&nbsp; Another man who had recently been
widowed
drew the woman out of her grief later.&nbsp; They married making the
island
their summer home from May through October each year.&nbsp; In 1778 the
husband joined the Army to fight in the American Revolution.&nbsp;
During
his absence, a hurricane hit the island sinking a brigatine off the
islands
shore.&nbsp; All were believed to have perished.&nbsp; However, a lone
figure was seen struggling along the shore.&nbsp; A manservant helped
the
surviving man to his Mistress' door advising that the Master was gone
to
war but his Mistress would look after him.&nbsp; When she opened the
door
and saw her lover there she fainted.&nbsp; The man realizing that his
love
had married another fled.&nbsp; He died alone on the mainland of a
deadly
fever.&nbsp; The Belle resumed her life but she was frequently troubled
by the presence of a gray figure that watched her from the dunes. He
appeared
to her prior to a hurricane, advised her to leave immediately.&nbsp;
When
she returned her house had been the only one spared the devastation
wrought
by the hurricane.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Another candidate as the Gray Man is Plowden Charles
Jeannerette
Weston who loved his home and the island faithfully.&nbsp; He died of
tuberculosis
but is said to appear to residents to warn them of impending
storms.&nbsp;
No one can identify the Gray Man as he does not have a face and is not
clearly seen.&nbsp; Even someone coming face to face with him cannot
make
out his facial details, as they are a blur - almost like a
silhouette.&nbsp;
Whoever the Gray Man is or was he continues to warn residents of
hurricanes.&nbsp;
It is recorded that he appeared prior to major hurricanes in 1822,
1893,
1916, 1922, 1940, and 1954.&nbsp; Prior to Hurricane Hugo in 1989, an
elderly
couple reported walking the dunes when they encountered the Gray
Man.&nbsp;
Not a word was spoken but familiar with the legend, they fled.&nbsp;
Their
home was the only one not demolished by the hurricane.&nbsp; Their
kitchen
door had opened in the storm, but their towels on the railings of the
porch
were still hanging undisturbed.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>How is this possible?&nbsp; Coincidence?&nbsp; Divine
intervention?</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>The spirits who remain behind do so for various
reasons.&nbsp; Some
because they don't want to believe they are dead, some who died
tragically,
and those who love someone or something so great they feel a need to be
the guard for eternity.&nbsp; Sometimes there is no explanation only
faith.&nbsp;
We have faith that someone will watch over us and keep us safe.&nbsp;
For
example, in 2003 a forest fire devastated California.&nbsp; In one area
the fire fighters were struggling.&nbsp; A lone house survived.&nbsp;
Why?&nbsp;
Was it because the fire fighters were successful or was it the lone fax
that was sent by the homeowners asking that God protect their home and
the fire fighters in their battle?&nbsp; Was it their faith?&nbsp; The
Gray Man is now an entity that when seen, people have faith that he is
warning them.&nbsp; They don't hesitate, they respond.&nbsp;
Frequently,
their home is the only one left standing.</b>
