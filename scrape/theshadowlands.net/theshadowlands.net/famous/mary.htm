      <center><b><font size="+2">The Mary Celeste - Mystery at Sea</font></b></center>
      <b>
      </b>
      <p><b>Originally named the Amazon, the Mary Celeste was built in
1860 at Nova
Scotia. By the time she was registered in New York, she had gone
through
several owners.
      </b></p>
      <p><b>On November 7, 1872, the Mary Celeste set sail from New
York bound for
Genoa. Captain Benjamin Briggs was an experienced seaman, an abstainer
from
alcohol, and a devout Christian. He commanded a crew of seven. The
captain's wife and young daughter also accompanied him on the trip. The
Mary Celeste's hold contained 1700 barrels of raw alcohol.
      </b></p>
      <p><b>On December 4, 1872, the Mary Celeste was found abandoned
and adrift by the
crew of the Dei Gratia, which was on her way to Gibraltar from New
York.
When members of the Dei Gratia's crew boarded her, they found the cargo
intact but no sign of the 10 people on board. The ship's papers,
sextant,
and chronometer were missing. The forward hatch was off and below decks
everything was soaked with water. The Mary Celeste's crew had left
behind
their oil skin boots, indicating that they had left in a hurry. A small
boat (the "yawl boat") was missing and a rope was found hanging over
the
side of the ship. When the Mary Celeste's cargo was unloaded at
Gibraltar,
nine barrels of alcohol were empty.
      </b></p>
      <p><b>There are several theories about the fate of the 10 souls
on board. An
investigator looking into the matter at the time concluded that the
crew got
drunk, murdered the captain and his family, and escaped in the yawl
boat.
This theory doesn't hold water (so to speak) because there were no
signs of
a struggle and the pure alcohol of the ship's cargo could not be
consumed -
it was poisonous.
      </b></p>
      <p><b>This would also discount the theory that the Mary Celeste
was set-upon by
pirates - why would they murder everyone on board and leave the cargo
intact?
      </b></p>
      <p><b>Another theory comes from the "Fosdyk papers". In 1913, an
article was
published in Strand magazine alleging that a man named Abel Fosdyk had
been
a secret passenger on the fateful voyage. Fosdyk alleged that Captain
Briggs had the ship's carpenter build a special deck in the ship's bow
for
his daughter. Captain Briggs and several sailors were swimming off the
ship
when one of them was attacked by a shark. In response to the sailor's
cries, everyone on board (including the Captain's wife and daughter)
rushed
on to the newly-built deck to see what was happening. The deck then
collapsed under their combined weight and they all fell in and were
also
attacked. Fosdyk landed on top of the decking and floated at sea for
days
before washing up on the African coast. If this account is accurate,
why
didn't Fosdyk come forward at the time? It also doesn't make sense for
crew
members to go swimming from a ship that was probably travelling at
several
knots at the time.
      </b></p>
      <p><b>Even the famous author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle had a take on
the Mary Celeste
mystery. In 1884 he wrote a story about the "Marie Celeste" called "J.
Habaruk Jepson's Statement".
      </b></p>
      <p><b>The most reasonable explanation is that Captain Briggs, his
family, and the
crew abandoned ship. This could have been due to a small explosion
caused
by alcohol fumes igniting or a rumbling of the cargo. They were likely
trailing behind the ship in the yawl boat, waiting to see if the Mary
Celeste exploded, when the wind snapped the rope. The occupants of the
small craft were either swept into the sea or died of thirst and
exposure.
      </b></p>
      <p><b>After the incident, not surprisingly, the Mary Celeste was
known as an
unlucky ship. She changed hands frequently, and was wrecked off the
coast
of Haiti 12 years later.
      </b></p>
      <p><b>So there you have it. This nautical mystery remains
unsolved. The only
entity that knows what really happened is the Mary Celeste herselfSand
she's
not talking.
