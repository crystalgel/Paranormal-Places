      <p><b><font color="#ffffff">Ah, the aroma of a fine cigar made
from the
sweet tobacco of the south. How many men have enjoyed them over the
years.
After a fine meal, with a snifter of brandy, or relaxing on one&#8217;s front
porch watching the last of that magnificent southern sun fade away into
the twilight sky. But did three cigars lead to the bloodiest single day
in American history? Apparently so as two great armies were to meet at
the woods and cornfields near Sharpsburg Maryland.</font></b>
      <br>
      <b><font color="#ffffff">George B. McClellan, commander of the
Federal
Army of the Potomac, forever cautious and convinced his foes were more
numerous than his, once again exercised his wariness upon learning of
Robert
E. Lee&#8217;s first invasion of the north. Much to the frustration of
Abraham
Lincoln, McClellan had yet to score a glorious victory for the union,
largely
due to his inactivity in pursuing the enemy.</font></b>
      <br>
      <b><font color="#ffffff">As the Army of the Potomac and Lee&#8217;s
Army
of Northern Virginia somewhat paralleled each other crossing into
Maryland,
Union pickets observed a small packet lying on the ground. Since this
was
previously occupied by Confederate pickets, the Union sergeant and
private
figured they must have found something of value. Much to their delight,
they did find something of value, three cigars wrapped in paper. Quite
a rarity and valuable discovery, it wasn&#8217;t until later they realized
the
true value of this treasure. The paper wrapped around the cigars was a
copy of Lee&#8217;s general order 191. This document provided troop strength
and intended movements of his army and was carelessly dropped upon
enemy
land.</font></b>
      <br>
      <b><font color="#ffffff">Upon receipt of this document, McClellan
is
quoted as saying, &#8220;If I can&#8217;t whip Bobby Lee with this, I shall gladly
go home.&#8221; He would have his chance on September 17, 1862.</font></b>
      <br>
      <b><font color="#ffffff">The battle of Antietam, or Sharpsburg as
the
Confederates referred, was actually three separate little battles
taking
place almost simultaneously. As the battle rages for numerous hours
throughout
the morning, fresh federal troops converge on the sunken road, so named
for its indented appearance on the earth due to the high travel of
wagons.
This road was soon to take on the macabre nickname, the bloody lane.
This
natural breastwork was defended by desperate Confederates; exacting a
deadly
toll upon the Union ranks.</font></b>
      <br>
      <b><font color="#ffffff">A belated support attack just south of
town
saw murder in the thousands as Union soldiers attempted to cross
Antietam
creek. Union General Ambrose Burnside, instead of having his men cross
at a shallow ford one quarter mile south, bottlenecked his troops as he
attempted to cross about ten thousand men over a bridge that could hold
six men across. The Rebel troops had an easy day of it, whereas the
Federals
had no cover and were herded like cattle trying to cross this
bridge.&nbsp;
History has renamed this bridge and his blunder to the Burnside bridge.</font></b>
      <br>
      <b><font color="#ffffff">By late afternoon, the battle ended.
Although
both sides would claim a victory; strategically it was a draw. Lee
limped
back to Maryland, and McClellan, typically did not pursue. As both
armies
exited the field, they left a total of 23,000 men killed, wounded, or
missing.
Thus ended the bloodiest day in American history.</font></b>
      <br>
      <b><font color="#ffffff">The battlefield looks much today as it
did
138 years ago. With the exception of some woods having been removed,
and
a few monuments, one can stand and peer at the same landscape that bore
witness to that horrific event. Today, one can see what those before us
saw, perhaps even bear first hand witness to a sampling of what those
brave
men endured.</font></b>
      <br>
      <b><font color="#ffffff">As the bloody lane became a mile long
pit
for Confederate dead, many seem to have stayed on. Visitors have
reported
the sound of gunfire when in the area of the bloody lane while others
have
smelled the unmistakable scent of black powder that seems to emanate
from
out of nowhere. One visitor to the park saw what he thought was a
company
of Confederate re-enactors only to realize that was not so when they
suddenly
vanished before his eyes.</font></b>
      <br>
      <b><font color="#ffffff">An elementary school day trip became
quite
an experience for some of those youngsters one spring day. After the
guided
tour, they were invited to wander the area of the bloody lane for a
short
time before their departure. Upon their return, they mentioned to their
chaperone that they heard what sounded like chanting, that seemed to
increase
in volume and intensity, emanating from all around them. When asked
what
it sounded like, they assimilated it to what sounded like the Christmas
song &#8216;Deck the Halls&#8217;. The youngsters said it sounded somewhat like &#8220;Fa
La La La La&#8221;.&nbsp;</font></b>
      <br>
      <b><font color="#ffffff">The area in which they stood saw the
charge
and decimation of the New York Irish Brigade. When asked if the chant
was
&#8220;Fahaugh A Balaugh&#8221;, most enthusiastically confirmed while some
remained
unsure. This was the Irish Brigade&#8217;s equivalent of the &#8216;Rebel Yell&#8217;;
meaning
&#8220;Clear the Way&#8221;.</font></b>
      <br>
      <b><font color="#ffffff">The Burnside Bridge isn&#8217;t without its
ghostly
tales. Drum cadences are heard from time to time, calling into action
the
brave men of a time passed. Torturous shouts and screams have taken
many
a park visitor by unwelcome surprise, reminding us of the bloodshed
upon
this creek span.</font></b>
      <br>
      <b><font color="#ffffff">Visits to the National Park, at the very
least,
will offer a beautiful view and a reverence to those who fought and
died
in a most tumultuous time in our nation&#8217;s history. Perhaps if you&#8217;re
lucky
enough, or unlucky, depending; you may just get more from your visit
than
anticipated. Perhaps you will hear, firsthand, the events that bestowed
the area around Sharpsburg, Maryland the dubious honor of hosting
America&#8217;s
single bloodiest day.</font></b><b><font color="#ccffff"></font></b>
