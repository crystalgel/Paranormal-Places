Let&#8217;s start with the history lesson.&nbsp;&nbsp; Known as the &#8220;Fort
that saved America&#8221;, Fort Mifflin has a history that dates back to the
1770&#8217;s.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the fall of 1777 George Washington&#8217;s Colonial
army was defeated at Brandywine by British forces led by General
William Howe.&nbsp;&nbsp; Howe&#8217;s 20,000 troops moved in and occupied
Philadelphia.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He wanted to crush the retreating
colonial army and end the revolution.&nbsp;&nbsp; He needed supplies
which were on over 200 British ships at the mouth of the Delaware
River.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A small contingent of troops manned Ft Mifflin
which was an unfinished British fort.&nbsp; They needed to delay the
arrival of the British ships.&nbsp; Time was of the essence for
Howe.&nbsp; He had to get his supply ships up the river before the
river began to freeze or his army would not be able to pursue
Washington.&nbsp;&nbsp; In November 1777 the siege of Fort Mifflin
began and only lasted a little over a week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
British did take the Fort but in the time it took to prepare for the
battle and the battle itself Washington was able to make his way to
Valley Forge.&nbsp; The Colonial Army was safely out of the reach of
the British and the river began to freeze which blocked Howe&#8217;s
supplies.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 400 men at Fort Mifflin held off the 200
ships and 2000 troops long enough to cover Washington&#8217;s retreat.<br>
      <br>
During the Civil War the Fort was used a prison for both Confederate
and Union troops as well as other prisoners.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Fort was
active through the Korean War and was closed down in the early
1960&#8217;s.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now the fort has been returned to what it looked
like during the Civil War period and is open to the public for tours.<br>
      <br>
The fort&#8217;s haunted history seems to tie into the Civil War era but
there are some older spirits there as well.&nbsp;&nbsp; What makes this
place unique is the large amount of sightings all describing the same
spirits in the same areas.&nbsp;&nbsp; Here is the breakdown of the
haunted areas of the Fort Mifflin and the spirits that haunted them.<br>
      <br>
The Officers Quarter&#8217;s is where you may encounter The Screaming
Woman.&nbsp; The screaming woman is thought to be Elizabeth
Pratt.&nbsp; She was the wife of an officer that hung herself after her
estranged daughter died of a typhoid fever.&nbsp; The daughter had
fallen in love with an enlisted man and she died before Elizabeth could
reconcile with her.&nbsp; The Police have been called out because of
people hearing the screams coming from inside the fort.<br>
      <br>
Casemate 5 was used as prison cells for confederate POWs, Union
deserters and other law breakers during the Civil
War.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many people report seeing a faceless man that is
sewing in the casemate.&nbsp; There is just a black void where his face
should be.&nbsp; He is thought to be Billy Howe who was imprisoned in
the casemate.&nbsp;&nbsp; He was later convicted of murder and hanged
in the courtyard.&nbsp;&nbsp; Billy was the only person hung here
during civil war.&nbsp; Many other soldiers and voices have been seen
and heard in this area.<br>
      <br>
Jacob the blacksmith was always getting in trouble with the commander
because he always wanted to back door open to the blacksmith
shop.&nbsp;&nbsp; He has been seen in the shop and the employees at the
fort still have problems with that door opening and closing.<br>
      <br>
Around the Power Magazine is where you may find a very informative tour
guide dressed in a Revolutionary War uniform.&nbsp;&nbsp; He gives a
great tour of the area and many visitors have complimented the guide
when they stop by the office as they leave the fort.&nbsp;&nbsp; When
they are told that there was no tour guide or re-enactor on site they
are very surprised. <br>
      <br>
During investigations I led for South Jersey Ghost Research at Fort
Mifflin we did get an above average amount of EVPs and motion sensors
detecting movement.&nbsp;&nbsp; Positive EMF readings, many psychic
impressions and apparition sightings we also reported by
investigators.&nbsp; We obtained positive photos including an
apparition photo from inside Casemate #5.</b>
