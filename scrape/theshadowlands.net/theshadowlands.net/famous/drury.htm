      <p><b>Sometimes you just can&#8217;t pull yourself away from good
theater&#8230;</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>The Drury Lane, Theatre Royal, is the oldest theatre in
London (save
the rebuilt Globe), having been built in 1663.&nbsp; Its walls have a
long
history full of intrigue, romance and murder.&nbsp; The most famous
ghost
to inhabit the audience is the Man in Gray, so named for his long gray
coat accompanying his tricorn hat, powdered wig and sword.&nbsp; His
dress
has been identified as common to the 18th century.&nbsp; He&#8217;s more apt
to shush patrons rather than scare them, he comes to watch the play
from
the balcony where he slowly walks from one end to the other only to
disappear
into the wall.&nbsp; Who said ghosts only appear at night, his favorite
haunting time seems to be between 9am and 6pm, time enough for the tour
groups to get a good peek&#8230;&nbsp; He is often seen at rehearsals and his
presence is considered very lucky.&nbsp; Of course, these are the
people
that want you to break a leg before any performance too so I think
they&#8217;re
just looking for something to hold onto.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>King Charles II, who gave the theater it&#8217;s Royal Charter,
also likes
to pop in now and again with his retinue.&nbsp; His love of the theater
also extended to a young actress/orange seller, Nell Gwynn, who got her
start at Drury Lane.&nbsp; She went on to become one of the most
popular
and infamous figures of that century, as both a comedian and Charles&#8217;s
mistress.&nbsp; Perhaps Chuck is wandering backstage to find his lost
lover?&nbsp;
He probably didn&#8217;t find her at the performance of Oklahoma but it did
help
Curly hit the high note in his solo&#8230;&#8221;OOOOOOOOOOOOOOklahoma!&#8221;</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Sweet young things are often &#8220;helped&#8221; along in their
performances
by the unseen hands of Joe Grimaldi, a popular comic and singer who was
often seen at Drury Lane (before his death, duh).&nbsp; He apparently
guides
them around the stage and gives actresses a little pat on the back
after
a good job.&nbsp; Not a bad gig for a dirty old man.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Something wicked walked through the theater about 200 years
ago and
left a rotting corpse behind.&nbsp; Around 100 years ago, workmen broke
through a wall containing the skeleton of a man complete with a knife
poking
out of his ribcage.&nbsp; Now call me crazy but I&#8217;m thinking he didn&#8217;t
do this on accident, at least not the bricking himself up bit.&nbsp;
The
remaining bits and pieces were gathered up and buried in a nearby
churchyard.&nbsp;
Perhaps this would&#8217;ve been the same churchyard that reburied the
coffins
left exposed in the Drury Lane graveyard in the 1830s.&nbsp; It&#8217;s hard
to imagine a more peaceful scene, you, the birds and someone&#8217;s foot
poking
out of the ground&#8230;</b>
