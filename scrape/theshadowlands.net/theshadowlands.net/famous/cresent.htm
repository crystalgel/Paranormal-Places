      <p>&nbsp;<b>The Crescent Hotel is located in Eureka Springs,
Arkansas.&nbsp; It is known localy as the "Grand Old Lady of the
Ozarks&#8221;, the hotel has served as many things over the years, from a
mental / cancer hospital, a summer home of a ganster,&nbsp; to a hotel
now.&nbsp; The hotel was built on the crest of West Mountain between
1884 and 1886. The construction of the hotel, and development in the
area, was a big selling point due to the natural spring.&nbsp; Many
felt they where healing waters.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      <br>
It is believed the first death was a workmen fell from the roof during
the construction. His body landed in the second floor area where Room
218 is now located. His ghost bangs on the walls and turns off and on
the lights and TV. <br>
      <br>
Room 218 is not the only haunted room, Rooms 202 and 424 are also said
to be haunted. Outside of the Recreation Room, the ghost of Dr. Norman
Baker has been seen.&nbsp; At first visitors assume it is a lost guest
because he is&nbsp; looking confused. The history of him is he ran a
hospital and resort there during the 1930s. The Rumor is he had NO
medical background.&nbsp;&nbsp; There are reports of an apparition of a
man who hangs out at the lobby bar or stands at the foot of the
staircase. A nurse has been seen on the third floor. A woman in Room
419 says she is a cancer patient then vanishes.<br>
      <br>
In the Crystal Dining Room visitors have reported people in Victorian
clothes sitting at the tables or in the mirrors, only to be gone the
next moment. <br>
      <br>
Visitors to this place have reported catching orbs, a small blue child
in Victorian clothes, faces, and many other oddities on camera. <br>
