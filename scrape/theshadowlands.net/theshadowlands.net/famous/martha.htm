      <p><b>The Martha Washington Inn, in Abingdon, Virginia, hosts a
number
of ghosts left over from the Civil War.&nbsp; Built in 1832 by
Congressman
General Francis Preston, the house passed into the hands of the
Methodist
Church upon his death two years later.&nbsp; The church then founded
the
Martha Washington College for young ladies on its premises.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>When the war reached their doorsteps in the mid 1860s, the
college
doubled as a hospital for the war wounded.&nbsp; One soldier, John
Stoves,
had been badly wounded and lay dying in what was to become room
403.&nbsp;
Beth, a student of the college, tended to him and fell in love.&nbsp;
As
he passed from this life, she played the violin to ease his pain.&nbsp;
Beth herself died a few weeks afterwards from complications of typhoid
fever.&nbsp; Her music can now be heard faintly caressing the night,
playing
to her dead lover and sometimes accompanying her solitary visits to the
room.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>A phantom horse waits for his master outside the front
steps, a Union
soldier that was shot in front of the house in 1864.&nbsp; On moonless
nights, the horse has been seen roaming the grounds searching for his
owner
and awaiting the call to ride home.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>The basement holds the spirits of black slaves, they were
kept in
an underground chamber and some were buried within its stone walls.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Before being killed by enemy soldiers, a young confederate
entered
the house and ran up the stairs to warn of encroaching Union
troops.&nbsp;
Shot upstairs, his blood still stains the floorboards outside the
Governor&#8217;s
Room.&nbsp; A bellhop, who&#8217;s been with the establishment for over 30
years,
tells that carpets that lay over the area develop holes over the spot
where
the soldier lay dying.&nbsp; Cold spots, apparitions and self-turning
doorknobs
have also been reported.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>My favorite ghost is still looking for half of his
head.&nbsp; Numerous
accounts of a soldier hobbling with help from a crutch and leaving a
trail
of mud in his wake have been reported from a hallway of the Inn.&nbsp;
Long past medical help, there is only speculation why he is here at the
old hospital, a ball leaving only a hideous mangle of bone and sparse
flesh
had split his head.&nbsp; Perhaps he&#8217;s trying to turn off the damn
violin&#8230;</b>
