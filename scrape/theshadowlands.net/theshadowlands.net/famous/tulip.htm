      <p><b>Was it a rip in time that caused an innocent photo of a
staircase
to reveal what could be one of the best examples of the other
side?&nbsp;
Ancient footfalls often resound in the Queen&#8217;s House at the Naval
College
in London.&nbsp; Nothing is known of the hooded figure climbing the
steps
aside from his apparent grief and the glimmer of a ring on the first or
second finger of his right hand.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Taken in 1966, Reverend Hardy and his wife used time-lapse
photography,
perhaps in an effort to capture an image of the ghost, on the unused
staircase.&nbsp;
Off limits to the public, the staircase was barricaded to prevent
visitors
from wandering about; I guess no one thought to tell the ghosts&#8230;&nbsp;
After the photo was developed and the images found, it was examined by
photographic experts, including Kodak, for its authenticity.&nbsp;
Further
attempts to duplicate it using props and actors yielded disastrous
results,
leading experts to conclude that the photo is genuine and there&#8217;s some
creepy thing crawling up the stairs at the Naval College.</b>
