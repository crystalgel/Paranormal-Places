      <b></b>
      <p><b>The old boarded up Fort Shelby Hotel has stood abandon for
over twenty&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>years on Lafayette Street near the outskirts of Detroit's
business
district.&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>For years it was shelter for homeless men who would find there
way
inside the&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>building to find refuge from the brutal Michigan
winters.&nbsp;
For years the only&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>tenant in the old hotel was the notorious Anchor Bar a
favorite
watering hole&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>for reporters from the areas two newspapers. For years it had
been
known as a&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>place where police, politicians, priests and pressmen could go
for
a cold&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>beer, a greasy hamburger and place abet on your favorite
horserace
or&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>football game.&nbsp;</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>A local street person who was known only as Moe found
part-time work
doing odd&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>jobs at the bar. After leaving the bar in the early morning
hours
he would&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>leave the bar and make his way to the rear of the hotel and
enter
the building&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>through some boards that he had loosened.&nbsp; Moe was a one
eyed
black man who's&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>face showed the results of years of drinking and living on the
street.&nbsp;
He was&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>quiet and polite but he was often seen driving away other
street
people who&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>might try to make their residence in the ruins of the old
building.&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>Sometime during the early 90's some rotted plumbing gave out
in
one of the&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>hotels basement levels and unbeknownst to the bar caused all
of
their sewage&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>to flow out into the hotel basement.&nbsp; For several years
people
that worked in&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>adjacent buildings noticed and complained about the smell to
city
officials&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>but it was blamed on sluggish sewers in the area. The bar
itself
was spared&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>the odor because it was totally sealed off from the hotel
proper.&nbsp;</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>During an unusually rare building inspection the startling
discovery
of years&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>of human waste was discovered. They say that it was well over
four
feet deep.&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>Inside one of the rooms they found the skeletal remains of Old
Moe.&nbsp;
He did&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>not drown in the sewage but it is suspected he became mired in
the
sludge as&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>he came down a stairwell and could not free himself while in
the
dark and&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>probably inebriated.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Strange as his death may seem the strange part of the story
is that
people&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>that work in the area still claim to see old Jim walking
through
the alleys&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>near the old hotel.&nbsp; There are reports of seeing Jim late
at
night sitting in&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>the alley behind the old Fort Shelby Hotel and some claim to
have
seen lights&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>moving through some of the lower floors of the building.&nbsp;
Some
even swear they&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>have heard noises coming from inside the building.&nbsp;</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>The bar is has moved out long ago and the building is now
well boarded
and&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>secure. Is it the city steam that pours from the manholes and
pavement
that&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>people mistake for someone moving through the alleys or is it
Old
Moe still&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>standing guard defending his turf at the old Fort Shelby
Hotel.&nbsp;</b><b></b>
