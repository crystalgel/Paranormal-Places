      <b>Port Monmouth is situated on the Lower New York Bay.&nbsp;
During the
American&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>Revolution, a British Naval officer named the Whitlock
Seabrook-Wilson&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>Homestead, the Spy House . Because the British Navy asserted
that
the house&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>was being utilized to spy on their ships.&nbsp;</b><b></b>
      <p><b>When in all actuality the spying was being accomplished
from Gerrett&#8217;s
Hill&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>by John Stillwell which was located a short distance away from
the
house. The&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>British in an endeavor to stop the spying attempted to burn
the
house down&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>but the attempt failed .&nbsp;</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>The house itself began from a one room cabin in 1648 and
was added
on to&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>throughout the years.&nbsp; Sometime in 1677 the middle
section
was added, which&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>was the widow Seabrooks home in 1703 .&nbsp; Daniel Seabrook
extended
his home to&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>his mother&#8217;s across the lawn after the death of Thomas
Whitlock.
The home&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>stayed in the Seabrook family for 250 years .&nbsp; The home
is
now the Spy House&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>Museum which presents the history and heritage of the Bay
shore.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>But the Spy House has its shadowy side also. It is said to
be one
of the most&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>haunted places in America.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>An alleged&nbsp; female apparition dressed in white come
down the
stairs from the&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>attic . She then walks into the rooms known as the Blue and
White
rooms,&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>located on the second floor. She than leans over a crib and
straighten&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>something in the crib, it is alleged to be a quilt&nbsp;
.&nbsp;</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>The apparition than turns away and fades into thin air. In
1975&nbsp;
as a group&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>was touring the house while in the same room, the sewing&nbsp;
machine
popped open&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>and the machine started to operate on its own without anyone
using
the foot&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>treadle . In the front vestibule on the first floor an
apparition
of a man in&nbsp;</b>
