      <p><b>This ghost, just in case you don't know, is known as The
Brown Lady
of Raynham Hall in Norfolk, England. The photo was taken in the earlier
part of this century by two photographers who went to Raynham Hall for
a photo shoot for the cover of their magazine. One of the photographers
saw the apparition and screamed for the other man to snap the
picture--he
did,and that's what came out. Before that the Brown Lady had been seen
many times before. Her portrait was in one of the rooms and that room
was
said to be the most haunted room of the place. A man volunteered to
sleep
there as an experiment one night, and not seeing anything, walked down
the hall to another room with two younger boys and they talked about
guns
that they owned and then got on the subject of the alleged ghost of The
Brown Lady. They laughed and shrugged it off, then agreed to walk him
back
to his room for the night. While in the hall, they stopped when they
saw
a tall lady float across the hallway towards them, holding a lantern.
They
froze and watched as she floated across from them. Then she turned and
looked at them with a look so full of malice and hate that it chilled
the
man staying in her room. He jumped out and aimed his gun at her,
shooting
her. The bullet went right through her and at that moment she
disappeared.
She wasn't seen again for nearly half a century. She is a very famous
ghost
and her picture is quite</b> <b>convincing. Two little boys have also
spotted
her.&nbsp;</b>&nbsp; <br>
