      <b>North Umbria, England&nbsp;</b></center>
      <b></b>
      <p><b>It has not been many years that Chillingham Castle has been
reopened
to the public. Since then, the neglected building and grounds have been
improved considerably.&nbsp;</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>In the castle there are several interesting rooms : the
Great Hall,
the Torture Chamber (some of the instruments shown there have once been
in use). You'll readily be told about the history of the castle -
including
many&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>spooky stories. There are even displays with both old and
relatively
new newspaper articles about the haunted castle.&nbsp;</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>The castle garden has been restored and although it is
quite small
it has been laid out very neatly.&nbsp;</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>It was Chillingham Castle that started the famous False
Alarm that
made the entire army leap to its feet, because someone had mistaken
some
charcoal fire for signs of the attacking enemy.&nbsp;</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>There can be few buildings in England with more ghosts than
Chillingham
Castle at least two of which, the Radiant Boy and the Grey Lady, are
based
on historic facts. The Radiant Boy is said to come from the
fireplace&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>in the Pink Bedroom at the castle, often in a blue flash,
which
people mistake for an electric fault. Years ago, when the fireplace was
being enlarged, the bones of a young boy were discovered there. The
Grey
Lady is&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>said to be ghost of the wife of Lord Grey. He ran away with
her
sister and in despair she killed herself. Her ghost is believed to
still
walk the castle corridors looking for her husband return. There are
frequent
ghost&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>watches organized at the castle, especially at Halloween. Few
people
go more than once!</b><b></b>
