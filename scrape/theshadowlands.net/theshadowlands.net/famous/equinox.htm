The

      <br>
      <b>to return the summer of 1865, but plans changed following the
assassination</b>
      <br>
      <b>of Abraham Lincoln. The family's ties to the area continued

      <b>&nbsp;with son Robert Todd Lincoln's purchase of neighboring

      <b>&nbsp;Employees at the hotel report seeing images on the third

      <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Renaissance Mayflower Hotel in
Washington,
DC hosted its first</b>
      <br>
      <b>Inaugural Ball, honoring Calvin Coolidge, on March 4, 1925,
just
two weeks after the</b>
      <br>
      <b>hotel opened. Mourning his sixteen-year-old son's tragic death
from
blood</b>
      <br>
      <b>poisoning, the president did not attend the ball. In 1937,
Inauguration

      <b>changed to January 20. The hotel has since experienced unusual
occurrences
on&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>January 20. In the Grand Ballroom, the lights seem to dim and
flicker
around 10:00 p.m.</b>
      <br>
      <b>It was at this hour tha the&nbsp; fanfare announced the guests
of
honor at President Coolidge's&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>Inaugural Ball.&nbsp; The electrical circuits have been
checked
by experts who can find nothing</b>
      <br>
      <b>wrong. Hotel staff have reported finding a plate of exquisite
hors&nbsp;
d'oeuvres along with</b>
      <br>
      <b>a glass of fine wine left in the Grand Ballroom balcony.</b>
      <br>
      <b>Strangely, neither item was served at any function on that
day.
One elevator</b>
