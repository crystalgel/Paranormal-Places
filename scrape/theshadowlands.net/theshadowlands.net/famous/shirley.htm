      <p><b>Gracing the southern Virginian colony and commanding a view
of the
James River, Shirley Plantation began building in 1723 by Edward Hill
III
for his daughter, Elizabeth.&nbsp; Hill&#8217;s sister, Martha, had left for
England to study, leaving behind an unsigned portrait of herself.&nbsp;
A strong mouth and deep eyes dominated the painting, almost daring one
to ignore its presence in the room.&nbsp; Martha later married an
Englishman,
Hugh Griffith, and remained in England.&nbsp; Though the portrait is
known
by the family as &#8220;Aunt Pratt,&#8221; no one seems to know the source of the
name
Pratt.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>In 1858, long after Martha&#8217;s death, the family noticed the
painting
rocking violently against the wall above the mantel in a third story
bedroom.&nbsp;
Moving the noisy portrait to the attic only intensified its turbulent
actions.&nbsp;
Knocking was heard around the house and word got out that the
plantation
was infected with a rather boisterous picture.&nbsp; The Civil War soon
surrounded the plantation and the residents of Shirley were caught up
in
the turmoil of having their home turned into a field hospital as
General
McClellan transported over 8,000 injured and dying men out of
Virginia.&nbsp;
With their access to the James River close by, injured men were
transferred
onto Union ships and the dead were buried in the family cemetery.&nbsp;
There is no mention of Pratt&#8217;s activity during this time, they probably
had more pressing matters to worry about.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>After peace ensued, the portrait was taken out of storage
in the
attic and placed on the first floor in a place of honor for the old
gal.&nbsp;
Though happy for a while, it soon began its rocking and the hunt was on
for someplace that the picture would remain quiet.&nbsp; Finally
placing
the picture in Martha&#8217;s second floor bedroom, it remained relatively
quiet
for the next few years.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>In 1974, the Virginia Travel Council loaned the portrait
with other
items associated with psychic phenomena to an exhibit at Rockefeller
Plaza
in New York.&nbsp; Once placed in a display window, the picture began
to
rock so vigorously that the seal of Virginia, which was placed beside
it,
began to swing from side to side in front of spectators.&nbsp; Aunt
Pratt
made her national television debut on NBC-TV as a reporter on his way
to
lunch stopped by to see what all the ruckus was about and caught the
rocking
on tape.&nbsp; It caused such a disturbance that it was removed from
the
exhibit and crated up.&nbsp; The night shift reported hearing crying
and
rocking in the storage room.&nbsp; One morning it was found on the
floor
outside the storage locker, some thought she was making a break for the
exit&#8230;</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>After being returned to Virginia, the portrait was taken to
Linden
Galleries in Richmond, Virginia to help repair the damage to the
frame.&nbsp;
While there, workers would tell of bells ringing, though there were no
bells on the property.&nbsp; The portrait was finally placed back at
Shirley
Plantation and is seemingly happy in it&#8217;s second floor bedroom.&nbsp;
Tours
are available of the mansion though you may have to pay more to see the
rocking&#8230;&nbsp; ;)</b>
