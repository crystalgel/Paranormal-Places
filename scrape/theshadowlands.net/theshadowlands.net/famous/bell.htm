      <center><b><font size="+2">The Bell Witch of Tennessee</font></b></center>
      <center><b><font size="+2"></font></b>&nbsp;</center>
      <b></b>
      <p><b>In Robertson County Tennessee, near the Kentucky state line
the most
extraordinary haunting occurs.&nbsp; The Bell Witch, an entity that
first
made its appearance in 1817 to John Bell and his family, is still
present
today although no Bells occupy the area and the farm house where the
haunting
focused is no longer present.&nbsp; It was burned to the ground by
neighbors
who witnessed attacks against the Bell family and who feared for their
own safety.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>The true identity of this spirit is unknown but it is felt
that The
Bell Witch is none other than the moody Kate Batts of Halifax, North
Carolina.&nbsp;
She was engaged to John Bell until her untimely death sometime in the
1770's.&nbsp;
Her lifeless body was found near a well close to her home.&nbsp; The
circumstances
surrounding her death are mysterious and remain unsolved.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>John Bell, her future husband, wasted no time mourning the
loss of
his intended.&nbsp; He married Lucy shortly after Kate's funeral.&nbsp;
The newly married couple made Tennessee their home.&nbsp; In 1817 John
noticed a doglike creature in his cornfield. Not wishing to have his
crops
trampled or destroyed, he got his gun and fired upon the animal.&nbsp;
The creature disappeared immediately into thin air.&nbsp; This was the
beginning of the end for John Bell and his family. Almost immediately
they
were plagued with sounds of someone wishing to enter their home -
scratching,
knocking and banging on the front door.&nbsp; Someone or something
wanted
in.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Soon enough, the presence found a way into the home and
began to
torment all that crossed the threshold.&nbsp; The presence introduced
itself
as The Bell Witch and while it focused most of its violence on John,
the
nine Bell children were also frequently attacked.&nbsp; The children
were
attacked as they tried to sleep by an unseen presence pulling their
hair,
slapping them, and whispering in their ears.&nbsp; As they would walk
to
school in the daylight they would be showered with rocks and sticks
falling
from thin air. The presence especially enjoyed tormenting the
twelve-year-old
Betsy Bell.&nbsp; Betsy would hear a disembodied voice that would grow
closer each day, she would fly into convulsions, and found herself
falling
into a dead faint as the haunting grew more intense.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>No one was safe from the evil spirit.&nbsp; Anyone crossing
the threshold
of the Bell home was fair game.&nbsp; Minister Johnson was asked by
John
Bell to bless his home and perform an exorcism.&nbsp; This did nothing
but anger the spirit who then retaliated against the Minister by her
usual
use of violence.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>A family friend, William Porter, came to visit the
Bells.&nbsp; The
Bell Witch announced to William that she would keep him warm as he
slept.&nbsp;
Having announced her plans, she proceeded to pull the covers from
him.&nbsp;
Within moments he felt a snake-like cold chill sliding against
him.&nbsp;
William quickly decided to capture the spirit within the blanket so
that
he could toss blanket and spirit upon the flames in the
fireplace.&nbsp;
However, the presence he captured within the folds of the blanket grew
heavier and heavier with each step he took and a foul odor began to
emanate
from the blanket as well. The weight of the blanket and the foul odor
overcame
William.&nbsp; He dropped the blanket and fled the house.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>John Bell, Jr. and Jesse Bell had fought under General
Andrew Jackson
in the Battle of New Orleans.&nbsp; The two had developed a good
rapport
with Andrew Jackson so in 1819, when Jackson got word of the
disturbances
at the Bell home he came calling to assist.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>General Andrew Jackson brought with him a witch slayer and
an entourage
of men.&nbsp; The wagon they were using suddenly stopped moving once it
came within close proximity of the farm.&nbsp; The horses could not
budge
the wagon even after the men threw their shoulders into the wagon and
began
to push.&nbsp; After an hour of cursing and ranting, General Jackson is
said to have acknowledged it must be the work of the Bell Witch.&nbsp;
At which time, it is reported that The Witch laughed and told Jackson
he
would be seeing her later that evening. The wagon was then freed and
able
to move.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Upon their arrival to the farm, the witch slayer attempted
to contact
the Witch.&nbsp; He cursed her, laughed at her and then finally
attempted
to shoot the Bell Witch with a silver bullet.&nbsp; To his
consternation
and everyone's amazement, he was slapped, battered and tossed about the
room by unseen hands.&nbsp; The witch slayer, Andrew Jackson and his
entourage
quickly fled.&nbsp; Andrew Jackson is reported to have said he would
battle
the entire British Army anytime, however, he would not wish to deal
with
the Bell Witch again.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Overtime, the Bell family suffered repeated attacks.&nbsp;
When Betsy,
John and Lucy's daughter, began to date a young man, Josh Gardner, the
Bell Witch did not approve.&nbsp; Betsy was singled out again and
tormented
to the point that she ended her engagement with Gardner.&nbsp; After
that
was done, the Witch focused on John Bell once again.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>John Bell was plagued by several illnesses of which The
Bell Witch
claimed credit. One attempt she made upon his life was prevented when
it
was noticed that John's tonic had been switched with poison. However,
December
19, 1820 John slipped into a delirium that he never fully recovered
from.
The Bell Witch is said to have sung at his funeral the next day.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>After his funeral The Bell Witch declared she would return
in seven
years.&nbsp; In 1828 she did return but only for a short period where
she
tried to torment Lucy and two of her sons.&nbsp; While the Witch has
returned
and continues to torment the Bell family regardless of where they are,
it is not nearly the same level of torment she committed upon John Bell.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>If the Bell Witch was Kate Batts, John's intended this
would make
the most sense.&nbsp; Whether John had a hand in her death or not, his
quick marriage to Lucy implies that Kate was not happy about John being
happy and returned to make him suffer.&nbsp; Her body was barely cold
before
John found a new willing bride. Perhaps, John was Kate's unfinished
business.
With John's death, Kate's or the Bell Witch's business was finished.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>There are still reports today that the area known as the
Bell Farm
is still being haunted not only by the Bell Witch but also by John,
Lucy,
and perhaps even Betsy Bell.&nbsp; The house is gone but the spirits
still
linger.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Emotions dictate behavior in life so why not in
death?&nbsp; Is it
possible that Kate was so angry with John at the time of her death that
she came back to exact vengeance?&nbsp; The question is not whether or
not John had a hand in her death but what did John do to warrant such a
vicious haunting?</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Kate was a violent and spiteful spirit that delighted in
others sufferings.&nbsp;
Perhaps, this is because she was unable to live her life in happiness
as
she died before marrying John.&nbsp; Then having the man who professed
his undying love for her, seek out and marry another immediately after
her funeral!&nbsp; John's behavior seems odd for this day and age, and
one would have to assume it was even in the 1770's given the haunting
of
the Bell Witch.</b><b></b>
