      <p><b>The Borley&nbsp; Rectory has been described as the most
haunted house
in England.&nbsp; It was located&nbsp; near&nbsp; Long Melford, Suffolk
.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b><b><font size="-2"></font></b> </p>
      <p><b>According to Harry Price, the rectory was built in 1863 by
the Rev.
H. D. E. Bull.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ghostly&nbsp; footsteps were reportrd in the
rectory in 1886.&nbsp; H. D. E. Bull died on May 2, 1892 and H. F. Bull
became the rector of Borley.&nbsp; On July 28, 1900, Mrs. Bull saw the
ghost of a nun on the rectory lawn.&nbsp; In November, 1900, Miss E.
Bull
saw the ghost of a nun on the lawn.&nbsp;</b><b><font size="-2"></font></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Many other ghost sightings were reported for several years
and on
June 10, 1929, the noted ghost hunter, Harry Price was invited to
investigate.
The&nbsp; Rev. G. Eric Smith, who had moved into the rectory in October
1928, left</b> <br>
      <b>in July 1929 because of the ghostly activity.&nbsp;
Poltergeist
activity was reported.&nbsp; The Rev. L. A. Foyster and his wife moved
into the rectory on October, 16, 1930.&nbsp; More ghostly activity
happened
in spite of an exorcism by two priests.&nbsp; Mrs. Foyster was given a
black eye when struck by a poltergeist. Bells were rung and strange
noises
were heard. In August, 1931, the Foysters held a seance in an attempt
to
stop the haunting. In October 1935, the Foysters moved out.&nbsp; Harry
Price rented the rectory for one year in order to conduct&nbsp;
investigations&nbsp;
in May,</b> <br>
      <b>1937.&nbsp; Many strange superatural things happened.&nbsp; In
December,
1938, Captain W. H. Gregson took possession of the rectory, which was
renamed
Borley Priory.&nbsp; On February 27, 1939, the house was
destroyed&nbsp;
by fire.&nbsp;</b><b></b> </p>
