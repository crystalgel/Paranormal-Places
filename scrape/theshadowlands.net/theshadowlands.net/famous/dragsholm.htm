      <center><b>Sealand, Denmark</b></center>
      <p><b>This is a tale from a famous castle here in Denmark, called
Dragsholm
Slot</b>
      <br>
      <b>(slot=castle in Danish).</b>
      <br>
      <b>It is in H&oslash;rve in Sealand, Denmark</b>
      <br>
      <b>It was built in 12th century by the Roskilde bishop.</b>
      <br>
      <b>When the building of the castle was completed, it became the
residence
for</b>
      <br>
      <b>both kings and several noble families.</b>
      <br>
      <b>Now it is owned by the B&oslash;ttger (since 1939) family who
has
converted the</b>
      <br>
      <b>castle into a hotel.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>However, as many other castles from that age, it has its
own story
to tell.</b>
      <br>
      <b>Actually, the castle has three ghosts:</b>
      <br>
      <b>A gray lady, A white lady and the ghost of the Earl of
Bothwell.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>The gray lady is said to be a woman who once worked there
as a maiden.</b>
      <br>
      <b>Unfortunately, she got she got a serious toothache which
caused
her great&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>pain.</b>
      <br>
      <b>She was cured though, and the story goes that after her death
she
returns</b>
      <br>
      <b>to the castle every night to see if everything is in the right
order,
as a</b>
      <br>
      <b>thanx for her cure.</b>
      <br>
      <b>But the gray lady is almost never seen, and less known than
the
two</b>
      <br>
      <b>following ghosts:</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>The white lady is said to be the daughter of one of the
many owners
of the</b>
      <br>
      <b>castle.</b>
      <br>
      <b>When she was in a young age, she fell in love with common man
who
worked</b>
      <br>
      <b>in the castle.</b>
      <br>
      <b>The relationship went on for some time.</b>
      <br>
      <b>Since the father was a rich and noble man, they kept their
love
secret.</b>
      <br>
      <b>But one day the father caught them and was furious.</b>
      <br>
      <b>He was so angry that he actually made the servants of the
castle</b>
      <br>
      <b>imprisoned his daughter inside a thick wall of the castle!</b>
      <br>
      <b>It is said that because of the tragic event, she every night
returns
to</b>
      <br>
      <b>the castle and walks around the corridors.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>In the 1930s they were building new toilets in the castle.</b>
      <br>
      <b>Therefore, they tore the old walls down.</b>
      <br>
      <b>When doing this, the workers actually found a little hole in
the
wall with</b>
      <br>
      <b>a skeleton with a white dress in it!</b>
      <br>
      <b>So maybe the old story is true, since it matches the story of
the
eye</b>
      <br>
      <b>witnesses and the story itself.</b>
      <br>
      <b>And many many people have seen the white lady walking in
castle
at night.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>The castle also has old cellars for prisoners.</b>
      <br>
      <b>In the 1500s the famous Earl of Bothwell was captured there.</b>
      <br>
      <b>He was captured there about 5 years and died in 1578 in the
cellar.</b>
      <br>
      <b>Some say that he was mad his last years-it's pretty
understandable!</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>He is one of the castles three ghosts-every night he comes
riding
in the</b>
      <br>
      <b>court yard of the castle with his horse carriage.</b>
      <br>
      <b>I myself have been in the castle and heard the feet of horses
scramble
in</b>
      <br>
      <b>the court yard as if someone's riding out there.</b>
      <br>
      <b>But every time you look out, there is nothing there.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>A group of American parapsychologists visited the castle
once and
took</b>
      <br>
      <b>their equipment with them.</b>
      <br>
      <b>In some areas of the castle there were extreme amounts of
electricity
and</b>
      <br>
      <b>radio activity.</b>
      <br>
      <b>Many ghost hunters has been there and got good and interesting
adventures.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Dragsholm castle is indeed one of Denmark's best known
ghost castles...</b>
