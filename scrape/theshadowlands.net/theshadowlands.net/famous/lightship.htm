      <br>
      <b><font size="+1">Located in Lake Michigan</font></b></center>
      <b></b>
      <p><b>Lighthouses and lightships have been around for</b>
      <br>
      <b>probably as long as man has sailed the oceans to warn</b>
      <br>
      <b>sailors of their closeness to shores and shoals as</b>
      <br>
      <b>well as ports of call.&nbsp; In the 19th century before</b>
      <br>
      <b>electricity and automation candles and large mirrors</b>
      <br>
      <b>(called a Fresnel Lens) at night, to announce ports</b>
      <br>
      <b>during clear weather, and bells during foggy weather,</b>
      <br>
      <b>as well as jagged rocks.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Such was the case of Captain James Davenport who, for</b>
      <br>
      <b>a whopping wage of $400 and seven months after being</b>
      <br>
      <b>hired to man the lightship called Waugoshance</b>
      <br>
      <b>Lightship located in Lake Michigan, the Chicago fire</b>
      <br>
      <b>broke out.&nbsp; There are two stories of what happened</b>
      <br>
      <b>during the fire and no one, to this day, is sure which</b>
      <br>
      <b>is true or just exactly what happened.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>The first tale states that smoke from the Chicago</b>
      <br>
      <b>fire, blown in by severe winds, caused a dense fog</b>
      <br>
      <b>over Lake Michigan.&nbsp; Now the differences in the</b>
      <br>
      <b>stories are in Captain Davenport's actions during this</b>
      <br>
      <b>time. The first story says that he sat in a rocking</b>
      <br>
      <b>chair for three days and three nights ringing the</b>
      <br>
      <b>bell.&nbsp; He kept himself awake by holding pots and pans</b>
      <br>
      <b>in his lap--every time he would doze off, the pots and</b>
      <br>
      <b>pans would clatter to the ground waking him.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>The other account is that while this dense fog was</b>
      <br>
      <b>over Lake Michigan a schooner ran aground on the</b>
      <br>
      <b>Waugoshance Reef and the crew swam ashore.&nbsp; For three</b>
      <br>
      <b>long and tiresome weeks they ate beans as Captain</b>
      <br>
      <b>Davenport played his violin with the sounds of Lake</b>
      <br>
      <b>Michigan for background.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>One fact remains, thanks to the valiant efforts of</b>
      <br>
      <b>Captain Davenport, only seven ships ran aground during</b>
      <br>
      <b>the whole ordeal.&nbsp; To this day no one is sure whether</b>
      <br>
      <b>it was three days or three weeks or even if it was the</b>
      <br>
      <b>violin or the pots and pans and the bell that saved</b>
      <br>
      <b>the ships.&nbsp; Although, sometimes if you listen closely,</b>
      <br>
      <b>you might hear the faint music of a lone violin mixed</b>
      <br>
      <b>in with the sound of the waves on a foggy night or the</b>
      <br>
      <b>faint sound of pots, pans and a lone bell to the</b>
      <br>
      <b>backdrop of the lapping of the waves on the sides of</b>
      <br>
      <b>the lightship.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Yet there is one other story of the Waugoshance</b>
      <br>
      <b>Lightship .... After Captain Davenport retired in 1885</b>
      <br>
      <b>one other lightship keeper was hired.&nbsp; His name is</b>
      <br>
      <b>John Herman.&nbsp; At&nbsp; this time, the information on Mr.</b>
      <br>
      <b>Herman's exact start date or the date of his early</b>
      <br>
      <b>demise is not known.&nbsp; The only known fact is that his</b>
      <br>
      <b>employment as Waugoshance Lightship keeper was cut</b>
      <br>
      <b>short.&nbsp; It seems that one night Mr. Herman stumbled</b>
      <br>
      <b>out of the lightship in a drunken stooper and fell off</b>
      <br>
      <b>of the short pier and drowned.&nbsp; His ghost is said to</b>
      <br>
      <b>wander the the lightship, Waugoshance, on Lake</b>
      <br>
      <b>Michigan.</b><b></b>
