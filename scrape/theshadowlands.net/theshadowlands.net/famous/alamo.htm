      <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This very famous, historical
landmark
which remains a prideful part of Texas history, is said to be truly
haunted.&nbsp;
Not a suprise, due to what has conspiring here in 1836.&nbsp; The Alamo
was orginally a small chapel built by Franciscan monks here in
1718.&nbsp;
Later it was expanded as a mission and a fortress, used by Texas as a
stronghold
against the mexicans over land rights.&nbsp; In March, 1836, the
president
of Mexico General Antonio Lopez de Santa Ana and 4000 troops laid siege
to the Alamo.&nbsp; The 11-day battle resulted in the deaths of most of
the 188 defenders of the Alamo.&nbsp; The Loses for the Mexicans were
over
1600.&nbsp; General Lopez de Santa Ana ordered the bodies of the slain
Texans dumped in a large grave and the Alamo torn to the ground.&nbsp;
But when the men started tearing down the walls, ghostly hands
protruded
to stop them and they fled in fear.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Alamo has not
forgoten
the cries of those that perished on that day.&nbsp; Today the Alamo
still
stands in the heart of San Antonio.&nbsp; Tourists staying in a nearby
hotel have reported seing grotesque apparitions coming from the wall of
the old Alamo.&nbsp; There are also other reports of a ghost on top of
the Alamo, walking back and forth trying to find an escape.&nbsp; Other
reports of screaming and yelling coming from the Alamo after hours are
also heard.&nbsp; I feel that most of the hauntings are actually
residual
hauntings, meaning that they are actually playbacks of past events
somehow
traped within time.</b>
