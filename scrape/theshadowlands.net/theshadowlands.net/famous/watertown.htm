      <b></b>
      <p><b>An American tanker named the SS Watertown was heading down
the California
coast to New Orleans via the Panama Canal in December 1924.&nbsp;
During
this voyage, deadly oil fumes in the cargo tank overtook two
crewmembers.&nbsp;
The two crewmembers were James Courtney and Michael Meehan.&nbsp; As is
the custom of sailors, the two deceased crewmembers were given a burial
at sea off the Mexican coast by Captain Tracy and the remaining
crew.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The ship continued on its voyage to New Orleans.&nbsp;</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Just before dusk following the burial, the first mate
reported seeing
two faces in the waves off the port side of the ship.&nbsp; These heads
continued to appear daily while the ship was in the Pacific.&nbsp;
Sometimes
lasting ten seconds before they would fade and then reappear.&nbsp;
However,
once the ship arrived in the Atlantic Ocean the neither Courtney or
Meehan
were seen.&nbsp;</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Upon arrival to their destination, Captain Tracy reported
to the
shipping office:&nbsp; The Cities Service Company.&nbsp; Presumably
Capt.
Tracy went to the shipping office to report the deaths and to fulfill
their
reason for going to New Orleans.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Prior to departing for the return trip to California, the
first mate
purchased a camera.&nbsp; The crew members once again appeared once the
ship was in the Pacific Ocean.&nbsp; Captain Tracy took six photographs
of the faces.&nbsp; He then locked the camera and the film in his safe
until he could locate a commercial film developer. Captain Tracy
delivered
the film to a developer who noticed nothing out of the ordinary in the
first five photographs, however, the sixth one revealed the faces of
Courtney
and Meehan clearly.&nbsp; To further credit the experiences of the
crew,
Captain Tracy took the photo to a detective agency to examine the
negative.&nbsp;
The agency confirmed the photo was not a fraud.</b><b></b>

      <b></b>
      <p><b>The crew continued to see the faces of their dead
crewmembers although
their appearances became less frequent.&nbsp; After the third voyage,
the
crew changed.&nbsp; There were no other sightings and no other photos
taken
of the ghostly pair.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Everyone knows that sailors are a superstitious bunch and
have been
since the beginning of time.&nbsp; Is it possible that the sightings
were
induced by mass hysteria?&nbsp; Did the two sailors quit their ghostly
visits when the crew changed because they were a figment of
imagination?
Was the ghostly pair just an optical illusion?&nbsp;</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>My response is absolutely not to all three!&nbsp; If they
were a
figment of imagination or result of mass hysteria how is it possible
that
we have a photograph examined and declared authentic? Optical illusions
are not something that can be reproduced time and time again in the
outdoors
in the ever-changing weather and sunlight.&nbsp; For optical illusions
there would have to be a constant.&nbsp; There is a constant here &#8211; the
two crew members sailing daily with their ship, crew, and captain and
this
alone would not produce a repeated optical illusion.&nbsp; The ghostly
crew of the SS Watertown continued to fulfill their duty even in death!</b><b></b>
