      <center><b><font size="+3">Annie Palmer and Rose Hall</font></b></center>
      <p><b>Annie Palmer is said to be of mixed English and Irish
descent.&nbsp;
There are no pictures of her, but she is rumored to have been rather
short
(under five feet) with dark hair.&nbsp; Some have said that she was
pretty.&nbsp;
Annie's parents were missionaries in Haiti, which is where she was
raised.&nbsp;
Annie spent a lot of her time with a native Hatian voodoo priestess who
taught her the black arts.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Annie married John Palmer at 18 and moved to Jamaica with
him.&nbsp;
The house she became mistress of is one of the few surviving Great
Houses.&nbsp;
Apparently, Annie did not enjoy married life with John.&nbsp; Some
accounts
say that he beat her, and others say that he learned she had taken a
slave
as her lover.&nbsp; Regardless of the reason, Annie poisoned John
Palmer.&nbsp;
Annie later married two other men, both of whom died under mysterious
circumstances.&nbsp;
Annie claimed that they suffered from mortal illnesses, and quarantined
the bodies.&nbsp; She later had them carried out and buried by slaves,
who disappeared afterward.&nbsp; It is believed that she had the slaves
killed so they couldn't tell anyone about the true cause of
death.&nbsp;
Interestingly, each husband lived and died in a different bedroom.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>One of the most widely-held beliefs is the certainty that
Annie enjoyed
torturing her slaves.&nbsp; She had a small second-story balcony on the
rear of the house, where she would stand and watch slaves being beaten
or whipped, often to death.&nbsp; Naturally, the slaves were terrified
of her and wished to be free from her.&nbsp; One story tells of a
servant
girl who tried to poison her.&nbsp; The attempt was unsuccessful.&nbsp;
Annie was aware of her slaves' fear and often had a cat test the food
before
she ate.&nbsp; This seems to be what she did this time, and discovered
the plot.&nbsp; Annie had the servant tried and executed, but requested
that the girl's head be returned to her.&nbsp; She kept the head on a
stick
outside as a warning to the other slaves.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Annie is said to have enjoyed riding horseback at
night.&nbsp; She
often rode through the countryside and mercilessly whipped any slaves
she
found outside after dark.&nbsp; The native Jamaicans also claim that
she
used her voodoo powers to create monstrous apparitions, often in the
form
of menacing animals.&nbsp; The stories say that she would be seen in
the
area shortly before or after the apparitions.&nbsp; These apparitions
often
appeared when the slaves met for celebrations or to conspire against
their
mistress.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>The most complete account of life at Rose Hall comes from
the journal
of a young bookkeeper who was sent to work at the plantation to learn
the
process before taking over one of his father's plantations.&nbsp; This
young man was much admired by Annie, who desired to take him as her
lover.&nbsp;
Unfortunately for her, the bookkeeper fell in love with a servant who
cleaned
his house.&nbsp; When Annie learned why the bookkeeper discouraged her
advances, she became very angry and put a curse on the servant
girl.&nbsp;
The servant girl became very afraid and told her uncle about the
curse.&nbsp;
Her uncle practiced the white magic side of voodoo, but was not
powerful
enough to life the curse.&nbsp; The servant girl died soon after.&nbsp;
Her uncle became very upset and held a meeting with a group of Annie's
slaves.&nbsp; One night, the group (led by the uncle) raided the
house.&nbsp;
They found Annie in her bedroom and killed her.&nbsp; The young
bookkeeper
heard of the plot and went along, trying to stop the slaves before they
killed Annie, but he was unsuccessful.&nbsp; Afterward, the slaves
burned
some of Annie's belongings - particularly the pictures.&nbsp; They were
careful not to burn everything, and not to destroy the entire house
because
they were afraid that Annie's spirit would put a curse on all of
them.&nbsp;
Although damaged, Rose Hall remained standing.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>After her death, Annie's slaves refused to bury her.&nbsp;
Annie's
neighbors eventually ordered their own servants to go and bury Annie on
the plantation grounds.&nbsp; Annie's grave is still there, next to the
house.&nbsp; When they marked the grave, they put crosses on all sides
except one.&nbsp; Apparently, they weren't sure if Annie's spirit was
inside
or outside of the grave, and they didn't want to make her angry by
locking
her out of her resting place</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Rose Hall was left in ruins for many years.&nbsp; Local
residents
were afraid to move into the Great House, remembering Annie's
declaration
that it was her house, and no one else would ever have possession of
it.&nbsp;
After many years, a couple bought it and planned to restore it for
themselves.&nbsp;
While they were moving in, a servant woman fell from the observation
balcony
Annie used for witnessing whippings, and broke her neck.&nbsp; The fall
was considered very mysterious due to the waist-high railing that
encircles
it.&nbsp; No one knows why the servant woman was on the balcony, but
many
believe that she was somehow lured there by Annie's spirit, and pushed
over the railing.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Several years later, another couple bought the house.&nbsp;
They
carefully restored it and gave it to the Jamaican people as an
historical
landmark.&nbsp; It is now open for guided tours, and contains a gift
shop.
Jamaicans still believe it is haunted.&nbsp; Tours of the house end
early
so that all of the employees can leave before Annie's spirit comes out
to wander.&nbsp;</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Many visitors report strange images appearing in their
developed
photographs.&nbsp; Some report the appearance of woman's face in the
mirror
in Annie's bedroom.&nbsp; Others report glowing or foggy areas
appearing
on the bed in Annie's room and sometimes in other areas of the
house.&nbsp;
Visitors have also reported that the film they used in certain rooms of
the house would not develop, while the rest of the roll was fine.&nbsp;
Others say that all the pictures they shot inside to house develop with
a misty look, while outdoor photos are clear.&nbsp; Some of these
mysterious
photographs have been sent to Rose Hall and are displayed in the gift
shop.</b><b></b>
