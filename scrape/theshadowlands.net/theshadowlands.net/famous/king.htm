      <p><b>&nbsp;The King House was originally built on an old Spanish
grave
yard and was used as a boarding house for travelers and sailors.&nbsp;
The first house fell to fire and was rebuilt sometime after April 25,
1881.&nbsp;
It still stands in Mayport, Florida to this day.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>&nbsp;The house was purchased , owned and occupied by John
King until
after his death in the late 1970's .&nbsp; It was during his years at
the
house that John King made it the celebrated Haunted House of the
area.&nbsp;
Mr. King told ghost stories to the children of Mayport on a scheduled
weekly
basis and soon was telling his stories to many, many visitors from all
over the county.&nbsp; A master storyteller, Mr. King was able to use
his
gift and the number of strange happenings which occurred to make the
house
come alive with the ghosts who had decided to roam the rooms and halls
of the old boarding house.&nbsp; A number of University studies have
been
conducted at the King House and it was concluded that the atmosphere at
the house was perfect for haunting and there was some kind of presence
in the house.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>&nbsp;Ghosts and Hauntings:</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>&nbsp;A distant aunt of Mr. King&#8217;s was pitch-forked to
death as she
sat in a green rocking chair by her jealous sailor
ex-boyfriend.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Mr. King claimed he still had the chair and it was used for selected
visitors
to sit in while he told his stories.&nbsp; Many, including Mr. King,
have
claimed the chair rocked with no one sitting in it.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
death
of the aunt is a great and tragic story and her ghost roams the halls
of
the house to this day.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>&nbsp;The &#8220;Little Man in Red&#8221; was a ghost who had a sense
of humor
and who would play games and tricks on Mr. King and his guests.&nbsp;
Mr.
King told of the times he would go down the stairs at the house and
there
would be strangers sitting in his living room.&nbsp; When he would
question
them about being in his house they would say they came for ghost
stories
and that his butler, a little man dressed in a red uniform, answered
the
door and let them in.&nbsp; He told them to wait in the living room and
he would get Mr. King.&nbsp; Mr. King never knew where the little man
came
from but he was one of the first ghosts.&nbsp; There was one time when
a young couple gave Mr. King&#8217;s ghost butler a ride from outside
Parnell&#8217;s
Restaurant when it was raining.&nbsp; When Mr King questioned the
couple
how they got into the house they told him the little man in red had
asked
them for a ride because of the rain and he had told them to wait in the
living room for Mr. King.&nbsp; Sometimes a couple would be surprised
to
find him sitting in the back seat of their car as it was parked by the
King House.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>&nbsp;The &#8220;Lady in White&#8221; was a young woman who was killed
on her
wedding night in a car wreck near the Little Jetty rocks near the King
House.&nbsp; Being so near by, the house was the perfect place for her
ghost to settle.&nbsp; Mr. King heard her crying the night of the
accident
and a few days later he encountered her in his kitchen where she would
spend most of her haunting time.&nbsp; She would be seen at the sink
doing
the dishes, or cleaning off the table or opening the stove.&nbsp; She
even
put away things Mr. King left out.&nbsp; She wanted to be a good wife
and
house keeper.&nbsp; She was also territorial and didn&#8217;t like other
women
in her kitchen.&nbsp; It was hard to be a female cook in Mr. King&#8217;s
House.&nbsp;
The &#8220;Lady in White&#8221; would make sure her cake fell.&nbsp; She also
followed
some of Mr. King&#8217;s guests home.&nbsp; It was consistently the young
girls
who would see her away from the house but she would always return the
same
night.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>&nbsp;The ghosts would pull the covers off of Mr. King and
guests
at night.&nbsp; They would&nbsp; open the doors when a door knob was
reached
for.&nbsp; Mr. King had a niece who would not go into the house because
she could always smell her dead husband&#8217;s cologne when she did.</b><b></b>
