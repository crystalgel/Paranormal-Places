      <p><b><font color="#ffffff">The LaLaurie House is a lavish
building at
1140 Royal Street, New</font></b>
      <br>
      <b><font color="#ffffff">Orleans, Louisiana. Most accounts agree
that
it was built in 1832 by Madame</font></b>
      <br>
      <b><font color="#ffffff">Delphine Macarty LaLaurie, a wealthy New
Orleans
socialite.</font></b>
      <br>
      <b><font color="#ffffff">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ghosts in the
house
are of some of her many slaves. While living,</font></b>
      <br>
      <b><font color="#ffffff">these people attended to her every whim
and
helped to keep up her stylish</font></b>
      <br>
      <b><font color="#ffffff">lifestyle. LaLaurie's friends often
joked
that she had one slave for every</font></b>
      <br>
      <b><font color="#ffffff">little task.</font></b>
      <br>
      <b><font color="#ffffff">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1833 LaLaurie's
slaves
began disappearing frequently. One day a young</font></b>
      <br>
      <b><font color="#ffffff">servant girl, Lia, ran from LaLaurie up
to
a roof top. She was trying to</font></b>
      <br>
      <b><font color="#ffffff">escape and screamed for help. Witnesses
on
the street watched LaLaurie beat</font></b>
      <br>
      <b><font color="#ffffff">the girl. Then Lia plunged to her death
as
she jumped from the roof trying</font></b>
      <br>
      <b><font color="#ffffff">to get away. LaLaurie had the body
concealed
in a well, but police soon</font></b>
      <br>
      <b><font color="#ffffff">found it. She was soon forced to sell
her
slaves at auction, but her friends</font></b>
      <br>
      <b><font color="#ffffff">bought them and retuned them to their
former
life.</font></b>
      <br>
      <b><font color="#ffffff">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On April 10, 1834, a
fire
brigade reported to a call from 1140 Royal</font></b>
      <br>
      <b><font color="#ffffff">Street. Entering the kitchen, they found
an
elderly cook chained to the</font></b>
      <br>
      <b><font color="#ffffff">floor. She claimed to have lit the fire
to
draw attention to the goings on</font></b>
      <br>
      <b><font color="#ffffff">at the house. The woman directed them to
the
attic.</font></b>
      <br>
      <b><font color="#ffffff">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fire brigade
could
hardly believe what they saw. The attic had been</font></b>
      <br>
      <b><font color="#ffffff">turned into a torture chamber with naked
victims
chained to the wall.</font></b>
      <br>
      <b><font color="#ffffff">Corpses were rotting where they had
expired.
Worse still were the torture</font></b>
      <br>
      <b><font color="#ffffff">victims, many of whom were still living.
One
woman had been gutted and tied</font></b>
      <br>
      <b><font color="#ffffff">up with her own intestines. Another
woman
had her mouth sewn shut. When</font></b>
      <br>
      <b><font color="#ffffff">rescuers cut the stitches, they found
her
mouth filled with feces. A man had</font></b>
      <br>
      <b><font color="#ffffff">a hole cut in his head with a stick
inserted
to "stir" his brains. Some</font></b>
      <br>
      <b><font color="#ffffff">people had been chained up just to
starve
to death. Many men were missing</font></b>
      <br>
      <b><font color="#ffffff">eyes, ears, fingers, and other small
parts
of their bodies. Obviously,</font></b>
      <br>
      <b><font color="#ffffff">despite the rescue, these people didn't
live
for very long.</font></b>
      <br>
      <b><font color="#ffffff">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This time, even
LaLaurie's
friends turned on her. She was run out of</font></b>
      <br>
      <b><font color="#ffffff">town and she went to Paris. Some reports
claim
that she died after being</font></b>
      <br>
      <b><font color="#ffffff">gored by a wild bull while there. Others
believe
that she returned to New</font></b>
      <br>
      <b><font color="#ffffff">Orleans to covertly live under the name
"Widow
Blanque". Her murder count</font></b>
      <br>
      <b><font color="#ffffff">has never been accurately tabulated.
During
renovations, skeletons dating to</font></b>
      <br>
      <b><font color="#ffffff">LaLaurie's time have been found, and
there
may be more.</font></b>
      <br>
      <b><font color="#ffffff">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The house went
through
many functions, including a girl's school, a</font></b>
      <br>
      <b><font color="#ffffff">tenement, an antique shop, an bar, and
now
apartments. Many of the people</font></b>
      <br>
      <b><font color="#ffffff">living in the house over the years have
witnessed
apparitions, noises, and</font></b>
      <br>
      <b><font color="#ffffff">screams.</font></b>
      <br>
      <b><font color="#ffffff">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the 19th
century,
a Black servant was awakened by the ghost of</font></b>
      <br>
      <b><font color="#ffffff">LaLaurie choking him. She is seen in all
areas
of the house. A large Black</font></b>
      <br>
      <b><font color="#ffffff">man in chains has confronted people on
the
stairs before vanishing. Some of</font></b>
      <br>
      <b><font color="#ffffff">LaLaurie's other servants have been
seen.
During the summer of 1999 a</font></b>
      <br>
      <b><font color="#ffffff">tourist photographed balls of light
floating
in the area of the roof where</font></b>
      <br>
      <b><font color="#ffffff">Lia jumped to her death.</font></b>
      <br>
      <b><font color="#ffffff">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The attic and
staircase
are among the most haunted. The building's</font></b>
      <br>
      <b><font color="#ffffff">ghosts are still believed to be active
though
the current residents don't</font></b>
      <br>
      <b><font color="#ffffff">speak about it. Ghost hunters insist
that
LaLaurie's spirit is evil and</font></b>
      <br>
      <b><font color="#ffffff">still dangerous. The house is a stop on
several
New Orleans ghost tours.</font></b>
      <br>
      <b><font color="#ffffff">Ghostly screams have been heard by
people
simply walking down the</font></b>
      <br>
      <b><font color="#ffffff">street.Viewing the home from the outside
seems
to be the safest way for an</font></b>
      <br>
      <b><font color="#ffffff">armchair ghost hunter to experience the
LaLaurie
house ghosts.</font></b><b><font color="#ffffff"></font></b>
