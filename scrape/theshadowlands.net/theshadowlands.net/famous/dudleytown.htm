      <p><b>&nbsp;Dudleytown is an abandoned 18th century village in
the woods
of Cornwall,&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>Connecticut. Though controversial with historians and
genealogists,&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>Dudleytown is one of the most intriguing haunted sites in
America.</b>
      <br>
      <b>The first settler in Dudleytown was Thomas Griffis, who
acquired
the first&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>plot of land in about 1738. Others, including the men of the
Dudley
family,&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>bought land and settled in the area around Griffis during the
mid-1740s.
The&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>people in the area helped to support themselves by cutting
lumber
to fuel&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>iron production in a nearby town. Life for these early
residents
was&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>difficult. The soil in the area is rocky and acidic. Being in
the
shadow of&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>three mountains Dudleytown receives little sun.</b>
      <br>
      <b>The intriguing part comes from the curse that many believe the
Dudley&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>family brought with them when they came from England. This is
also
where&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>various sources begin to disagree. Some say that the Dudleys
came
from a&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>long line of damned people, including a primary carrier of the
Bubonic&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>Plague and a Lord who lost his head along with Lady Jane Grey.
Others&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>believe that the Dudleys tangled with powerful royals who
arranged
to have&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>a curse put on them. (This is also the reason given as to why
they
left&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>England.) People also think that the land itself was
spiritually
unsettled&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>long before the town was founded.</b>
      <br>
      <b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Though it is assumed that Abiel, Barzillai,
Gideon,
and Abijah Dudley&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>were all brothers, there is no proof. At any rate, Abiel is
the
first&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>brother to appear in the records, having been listed in tax
records
from&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>1744. Abiel was also one of the first victims of the curse,
loosing
his mind&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>as well as his money. He lived hand to mouth for the rest of
his
life, doing&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>odd jobs for the townspeople in order to earn his keep.</b>
      <br>
      <b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Insanity, murder and suicide were rapidly
becoming
a staple of life in&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>Dudleytown. The first recorded fatality happened in 1792, when
Gershom&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>Hollister fell while repairing a barn. Hollister is believed
to
have been&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>murdered by William Tanner, who owned the barn. Turner soon
went
insane due&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>to the controversy.</b>
      <br>
      <b>Just after moving away from Dudleytown in 1763, most of the
Nathaniel
Carter&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>family was wiped out by Indians. In 1804, Sara Faye Swift was
struck
by&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>lightening and killed. Her husband, General Herman Swift ( a
veteran
of the&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>Revolutionary War ) went crazy afterwards. Dudleytown's most
famous
resident&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>Mary Cheney ( wife of Horace Greeley ) hung herself in 1872.</b>
      <br>
      <b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Many strange tales were told about Dudleytown
during
the 19th century.&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>People reported seeing strange beasts and apparitions. Corpse
mutilations&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>were reported, along with still more suspicious and unusual
deaths.&nbsp;
Soon&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>people began to give up on Dudleytown, and it was mostly
deserted
by 1900.</b>
      <br>
      <b>&nbsp;&nbsp; However, people still tried to live in
Dudleytown.
During the 1920's Dr.&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>William C. Clark set up a summer home in the abandoned town.
One
evening he&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>came back from a business trip to find his wife laughing
hysterically.
She&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>told her husband&nbsp; about the apparitions and demons that
had
visited while he&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>was absent. She killed herself when they returned to New York.
Ironically,&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>Dr. Williams remarried and continued to spend his summers in
Dudleytown.
In&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>fact, he formed the Dark Entry Forrest Association, which
helps
to protect&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>Dudleytown's remains.</b>
      <br>
      <b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Many visitors today often report lots of
disembodied
voices whispering&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>and laughing. A woman on a white horse has been spotted among
other&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>apparitions. People also hear wagon wheels and other sounds of
the
past. The&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>one thing that people do&nbsp; not hear in Dudleytown are
birds
and other life&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>sounds. Living animals seem to flee the area.&nbsp; Some
believe
that this area&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>is a vortex, or simply an area of negative energy that
attracts
unpleasant&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>spirits and people.</b>
      <br>
      <b>Dudleytown can be difficult for visitors. The site is
considered
dangerous&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>because many people report&nbsp; getting minor injuries, being
pushed
and shoved&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>by unseen hands, or simply overcome by feelings of despair. As
stated&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>before, the area is owned by the Dark Entry Forrest
Association
and visitors&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>after dark are considered trespassers. There are no signs
pointing
out the&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>location as the locals are concerned about vandals and
cultists.
If you&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>choose to visit Dudleytown please obey local laws and exercise
caution.</b><b></b>
