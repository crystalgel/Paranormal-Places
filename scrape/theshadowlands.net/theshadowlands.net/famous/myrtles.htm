      <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Located&nbsp; seventy miles
north of
New Orleans.&nbsp; The Myrtles Plantation&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>contains some of the most interesting architecture seen in the
south;
lacy&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>ornamental ironwork outside and plaster friezes inside the
large
airy rooms.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>The Myrtles Plantation also has been featured in such
magazines
as Life,&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>Southern Living, The Wall street Journal, USA Today, Family
Circle
and many&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>other publications.&nbsp; Many T.V. stations have also done
features
on this&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>house.&nbsp; Not all publicity had to do with the
architecture.
According to the&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>U.S. Tourist Bureau the Myrtles Plantation is one of the
authenicated
haunted&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>houses of America.</b>
      <br>
      <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It seems the
Myrtles
Plantation of Louisiana has many different&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>spirits that roam its beautiful landscaped areas outside and
inside
the manor&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>itself. The most famous ghost would have to be Chloe, she was
a
governess for&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>Judge Clark Woodruffe's children. The Judge also carried on a
affair
with the&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>mullatto woman.&nbsp; He soon tired of her and banished her
from
connection with&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>the family.&nbsp; He then caught her eavesdropping on a
conversation
of his.&nbsp; In&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>anger he decided to make an example of Chloe and have her ear
cut
off.&nbsp; After&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>that she wore a green turban to hide her deformity.&nbsp; She
extracted
her&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>revenge however, she asked to bake a birthday cake for one of
the
Judges&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>children, a peace offering in a way and was granted
permission.&nbsp;
While mixing&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>up the cake she added a few choice ingrediants to the batter
that
wasn't in&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>the recipe. She poisoned two of the judges children and his
wife
to death.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>She was hanged for her wickedness,&nbsp; her corpse was then
thrown
in a nearby&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>river.</b>
      <br>
      <b>&nbsp;&nbsp; The ghost of Chloe has been seen several times
roaming
around the mansion&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>in the middle of the night.&nbsp; Sometimes a baby's cry is
heard
when she is&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>seen.&nbsp; She also likes to disturb the sleep of the guests
by
lifting the&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>mosquitto netting that surrounds the beds.&nbsp; Some say she
is
still checking on&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>the Judges children she used to govern.</b>
      <br>
      <b>Another spirit that makes himself known is William Winter who
owned
the&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>Plantation between 1860-1871, his spirit is said to linger
because
of the&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>strange circumstances surrounding his death.&nbsp; He was
called
out on to the&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>porch one night where he was shot in the chest,&nbsp; he then
staggered
back into&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>the house and managed to climb 17 of the 20 stairs where he
died
in his wifes&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>arms. He is now heard climbing the stairs but he only makes it
to
the 17th&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>one.</b>
      <br>
      <b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Other sketchy sightings at the Myrtles Plantation
have
included a pool of&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>blood, apparitions of two little blonde girls peering through
the
windows, a&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>mischievous child entity who likes jumping on freshly made
beds,
he is&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>followed closely by a young woman in a maids uniform who
smoothes
the rumpled&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>bed linens.&nbsp; A confederate soldier marches across the
porch,
a man in khaki&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>waits at the gate to warn customers away, no-one living is
posted
there.&nbsp; A&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>VooDoo preistress spirit is seen from time to time chanting
over
the still&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>form of a young girl.&nbsp; Legend has it she was unable to
use
her powers to save&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>the girl from a fatal disease.</b>
      <br>
      <b>&nbsp;&nbsp; All these spirits and more are seen, felt, and
heard
at the Myrtles&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>Plantation. It really is a house of spirits...</b><b></b>
