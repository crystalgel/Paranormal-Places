      <p><b>Secret rooms, bloodstained stones and pacts with the Devil
have shrouded
Scotland&#8217;s Glamis Castle in mystery and hauntings.&nbsp; Shakepeare&#8217;s
Macbeth
is rumored to have murdered King Duncan within its walls and Malcom
II&#8217;s
bloody death had stained the floor so violently that the room was
bricked
up.&nbsp; Did the echoes of these events leave a residue that walks at
night?&nbsp;</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Glamis&#8217;s brutal history may have partly stemmed from its
own lords
misdeeds with the Devil.&nbsp; One legend tells of a secret room. The
second
lord of Glamis, in the fifteenth century, was well known for his
debauched
lifestyle.&nbsp; Famous for gambling, wenching and drinking, he earned
the nickname &#8220;Earl Beardie&#8221; or &#8220;the Wicked Lord.&#8221;&nbsp; One evening,
after
failing to find someone to play cards with him on Sunday, he announced
that he would play cards with the Devil himself.&nbsp; The knock on the
door immediately afterwards was too much of a coincidence but he opened
it anyway to admit a tall bearded man wearing all black.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>When asked if he would still like a partner in which to
play cards,
Earl Beardie welcomed him into a small room and closed the door.&nbsp;
Servants outside could hear shouting and furniture flying as the men
gambled
away the evening and into the dark night.&nbsp; At one point, the
stranger
made a suggestion to which Earl Beardie agreed.&nbsp; One of the
servants
crept close to the door to see what was happening, at which point the
Lord
discovered he was being spied upon through the keyhole.&nbsp; He burst
from the room to yell at the servant and when he returned, the stranger
had left and taken Earl Beardie&#8217;s soul with him.&nbsp; Beardie died
five
years later, his ghost still drunkenly roaming the halls trapped for
eternity
to return to the room to play cards with the Devil.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Other rooms exist to taunt the curious.&nbsp; During the
eighteenth
century, a legend started saying that a room held secret so horrible
that
only the earl of Strathmore, his heir and the steward of the castle
would
be allowed to view it.&nbsp; The secret so changed the manner of the
lords
after seeing it on their 21st birthday, some refused to acknowledge the
room fearing their sanity would be lost.&nbsp; The most popular theory
today is that the room held the remains of a rightful heir born
deformed
and locked away.&nbsp; The subsequent heirs of his brother, who assumed
the title, were shown the man who grew to adulthood within the tiny
room,
their earldom resting on the belief that they were the true inheritors
of the title.&nbsp; Ghost rumors were brought in as a distraction away
from the truth of the room, they were more palatable than what was
locked
inside.&nbsp; In order to find that hidden room, towels were once hung
in every window of the castle only to find one that had no towel.&nbsp;
No amount of searching has produced a secret entrance to that room.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Glamis has its own white or gray lady.&nbsp; She is
believed to be
the ghost of Janet Douglas, the wife of the sixth lord of Glamis,
James.&nbsp;
After his death one morning, she was suspected of killing him but in
the
absence of evidence, the charges were dropped.&nbsp; She, however, had
gained the reputation of being a witch.&nbsp; There was no evidence
needed
for a trial of that kind, so when she came under suspicion for plotting
the murder of the King of Scotland, she was tried, condemned and
executed
in Edinburgh in 1537.&nbsp; Her ghost returned home and now wanders the
halls of Glamis, looking for justice.&nbsp; She is often seen praying
in
the small chapel she took refuge in those many years ago.</b><b></b>
