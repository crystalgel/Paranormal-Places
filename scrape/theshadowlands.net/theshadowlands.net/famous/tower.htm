      <b></b>&nbsp;
      <h4><b>Over the past 1000 years, the Tower of London has seen
more than its</b>&nbsp;</h4>
      <b>fair share of murders, executions, tortures and poisonings.
It's little</b>&nbsp;
      <p><b>wonder therefore that a few of its victims should remain
there in
death.</b>&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p><b>On the 12th February 1957 a guardsman came face to face
with one
of the</b>&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p><b>ghostly residents at the foot of the Salt Tower. It was
3.00am when</b>&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p><b>something struck the roof of the sentry-box in which he was
sheltering</b>&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p><b>from the rain. Stepping out, he looked up to see what it
was, and
saw a</b>&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p><b>shapeless white ghost on the top of the tower. He shouted,
bringing
out</b>&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p><b>the guard captain and the duty warder. They both searched
the Tower,</b>&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p><b>but could find nothing. Is it a coincidence that on 12
February 1554</b>&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p><b>Lady Jane Grey was beheaded on Tower Green, which lies less
than
200</b>&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p><b>yards away from the Salt Tower?</b>&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p><b>One of the best known ghosts is that of Anne Boleyn, who
also lost
her</b>&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p><b>head on Tower Green. She is now said to carry her head
under her
arm on</b>&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p><b>the eve of a death. A sergeant serving with the Artist's
Rifles was
on</b>&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p><b>duty the night before several spies were due to be executed
during
the</b>&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p><b>First World War. He claimed that the night before Carl Lody
was</b>&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p><b>executed, he saw the ghost of Anne Boleyn in a silk dress
and a white</b>&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p><b>ruff.&nbsp;</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Anne has also been seen in the Tower Chapel. One night, a
guard captain</b>&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p><b>and a sentry set off on their rounds, but when they reached
the chapel</b>&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p><b>they both noticed lights coming from inside. The captain
sent for
a</b>&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p><b>ladder and climbed up to a window to look within. He found
the interior</b>&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p><b>lit with a blue-white light, and a ghostly procession of
men and
women</b>&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p><b>in Tudor costume could be plainly seen walking down the
central aisle.</b>&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p><b>At the head of the procession was the spirit of Anne
Boleyn. Suddenly</b>&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p><b>the light faded and the chapel was left in complete
darkness.</b>&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p><b>It's not only ghosts of people that visit the Tower. In
1816 a sentry</b>&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p><b>was walking his beat in front of the Jewel House when he
saw a dark</b>&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p><b>shape moving on the steps of the building. He approached
the figure</b>&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p><b>just as the moon came out from behind some clouds,
revealing a huge
bear</b>&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p><b>lunging at him. Paniced, he struck out at the bear with his
bayonet
but</b>&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p><b>the blade simply passed through the bear, which then
engulfed him.
He</b>&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p><b>was later found (unconcious?) by another sentry and died
shortly
after.</b>&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p><b>Pleasant dreams.....</b>&nbsp;
