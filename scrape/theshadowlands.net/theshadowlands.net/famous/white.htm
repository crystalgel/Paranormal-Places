Saloon</font></b></center>
      <p><b>Across the river from Portland's shanghai tunnels, the
White Eagle
Saloon welcomed the seedier side of frontier life in the early 20th
century.&nbsp;&nbsp;
After the work whistle blew, men left docks hungry and searching for
more
than food.&nbsp; They'd board the trolley that lumbered up Mississippi
Avenue and leapt off in droves as the conductor yelled out, "Next stop,
Bucket of Blood!"&nbsp; So named for the brawls that erupted in the
saloon
and crept out into the night, the White Eagle's less than pristine
reputation
rivaled the infamous tunnels in Portland's Chinatown.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>The two-storied brick building housed a "white" brothel
upstairs
and a "black and Chinese" brothel in the basement.&nbsp; The lonely
spirit
of Rose wanders the thirteen rooms upstairs, her weeping heard to echo
the silent rooms.&nbsp; Rose was a "working girl" and considered the
personal
property of the saloon manager.&nbsp; One of her paying customers had
fallen
in love with the girl and wanted to take her away from this life of
danger
and dead-ends.&nbsp; Frightened by the prospect of confronting the
manager,
Rose refused.&nbsp; When her young lover faced his cruel adversary, he
was beaten nearly to death.&nbsp; Undaunted and sure of his love, he
again
pleaded with Rose to run away with him.&nbsp; When she refused, he grew
enraged and stabbed her to death in one of the upstairs bedrooms.&nbsp;
Rose didn't let that little mishap daunt her spirit, patrons have
reported
being propositioned by a woman that could only be the ghost of the
long-dead
prostitute.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Now owned by the McMenamin Corporation, the previous owner
had ventured
upstairs only when needed.&nbsp; The rooms all have working locks
though
each time he attempted to enter the rooms, some would refuse to open
while
others stood ready for visitors.&nbsp; He closed off the upper level
and
simply let the inhabitants be.&nbsp;&nbsp; Another spirit that haunts
the
upstairs is that of Sam.&nbsp; Taken in as a child, he worked in the
saloon
the length of his life.&nbsp; When he died an old man, his shade
continued
to watch over his home.&nbsp; His belongings remained in his room
though
they have been found moved to other rooms on the second floor.&nbsp;
Passersby
have reported seeing the image of a man gazing from the second floor
windows
as they pass by, perhaps he's watch over them too.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>The basement held the secrets of saloon.&nbsp; The black
and Chinese
women brought in from the docks or sold as virtual slaves were held in
tiny rooms and made to sell their bodies in lieu of beatings from the
management.&nbsp;
Children born to the women were disposed of quickly so they could
return
to work.&nbsp; The spirits of these desperate women clog the
atmosphere,
their pain etched into the walls and mark the air.&nbsp; A tunnel was
dug
to assist the owners in their nefarious deeds of drugging men and
selling
them to ship captains a quarter of a mile away on the Willamette
River.&nbsp;
Snaking through the banks of the river, the men never had a
chance.&nbsp;
One owner of the saloon in recent times had an office in the
basement.&nbsp;
At night, he would hear over the low hum of his television, music
cascading
down from the bar after closing.&nbsp; Another time, coins would fall
from
the ceiling into the basement.&nbsp; At one time, he felt what appeared
to be a strong earthquake that shook the building to its core.&nbsp;
When
turning to the television, he could find no reports for what he had
just
felt.&nbsp; A waitress, beginning her decent down into the basement was
shoved from behind, in full view of the owner.&nbsp; She tumbled the
length
of the stairs and sustained minor injuries.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>The bar section is a long, narrow band that spans the
building front
to back.&nbsp; Tequila was the beverage of choice for many years, the
patrons
lining up to match the row of shot glasses on the bar.&nbsp; There is a
small dance area near the back and live music dominates on many
nights.&nbsp;
The spirits apparently have frequented the bathrooms. One lady, while
using
the facilities, entered into a toilet paper fight over the stall walls
with a friend, only to discover there was no one there after her friend
had left ages earlier.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Luckily for us, McMenamin's has decided to open up the
rooms upstairs
for nightly visitors.&nbsp; Rates are incredibly cheap so if you'd like
to stay after imbibing a bit too much Jose, please contact their
website
and make a reservation for a room with a BOO!&nbsp; (Sorry, I just had
to do it)</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Author's note:&nbsp; I have visited the White Eagle and
while I was
refused my request to peek upstairs (this was before the opening of the
hotel part), I did get the distinct feeling of being watched while
there.&nbsp;
Heck, I should've whipped out my handy-dandy Shadowlands Press badge,
who
knows what a story I would've gotten then .</b><b></b>
