      <b></b>
      <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The old sailing ship floating
quietly in
Baltimore's Inner Harbor has a</b>
      <br>
      <b>long and bloody history. Not surprisingly, the USS
Constellation
also has a</b>
      <br>
      <b>reputation of being one of the most haunted sites in America.
It
has been</b>
      <br>
      <b>rebuilt and refitted many times, but the ghosts still linger.
The
original</b>
      <br>
      <b>vessel, built as a 36 gun frigate, was first launched from
Harris
Creek,</b>
      <br>
      <b>Maryland on September 7, 1797. She was among a group of ships
commissioned</b>
      <br>
      <b>for the US Navy that included Boston's Constitution.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Commodore Thomas Truxton was the
first captain
of the Constellation,</b>
      <br>
      <b>and he got her off to a bloody start. One day in 1799 the
ship's
crew scored</b>
      <br>
      <b>a major sea victory when they captured the French Frigate
L'Insurgent
while</b>
      <br>
      <b>in the West Indies. During the battle, seaman Neil Harvey fell
asleep
while</b>
      <br>
      <b>on watch.&nbsp; When Truxton learned of Harvey's lapse in duty
he
ordered a</b>
      <br>
      <b>lieutenant to run a sword through the man's gut. Later, after
the
battle was</b>
      <br>
      <b>over, Truxton had Harvey's body tied to a cannon and blown to
pieces
to</b>
      <br>
      <b>serve as a warning to other sailors. Neil Harvey has become
one
of the most</b>
      <br>
      <b>frequently seen ghosts aboard the Constellation. He has even
been
mistaken</b>
      <br>
      <b>for a costumed tour guide.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ship in her many incarnations
went on
many missions, including</b>
      <br>
      <b>slave interdiction and providing support for land troops
fighting
against</b>
      <br>
      <b>the Seminole Indians. The Constellation distinguished herself
in
the War of</b>
      <br>
      <b>1812 and against the Barbary Pirates. She has sailed to such
exotic
places</b>
      <br>
      <b>as China, West Africa, and Hawaii.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1822 a boy was serving aboard
as a surgeon's
assistant. He was</b>
      <br>
      <b>stabbed to death by two other sailors, though it is not known
why.
Psychic</b>
      <br>
      <b>Sybil Leek once confirmed that the boy's spirit is still
aboard
the ship.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The USS Constellation entered the
Norfolk,
Virginia Navy yard in 1845.</b>
      <br>
      <b>The restructuring that she underwent there is still a source
of
argument</b>
      <br>
      <b>amoung historians. Some believe that the entire 1797 vessel
was
scrapped and</b>
      <br>
      <b>a completely new ship was erected. Other analysis has proved
that
timbers,</b>
      <br>
      <b>materials, and equipment were used from the original ship. It
is
very</b>
      <br>
      <b>unlikely that one hundred percent of the 1797 ship was intact,
even
in 1845.</b>
      <br>
      <b>She had received a new stern (back end) in 1829-30. Not to
mention,
the hull</b>
      <br>
      <b>of a wooden ship had to be rebuilt on an average of every 16
years.</b>
      <br>
      <b>Whatever was left of the original vessel, it's use in the new
ship
was</b>
      <br>
      <b>enough to keep the ghosts around.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1855 the Navy's modifications
were completed.
The Constellation had</b>
      <br>
      <b>been downgraded from a 36 gun frigate to a 22 gun sloop of
war.
She was</b>
      <br>
      <b>launched on July 28 of that year and is now considered the
last
all sail</b>
      <br>
      <b>powered vessel built for the US Navy. (Ship builders had begun
to
prefer</b>
      <br>
      <b>steam power.)</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Late in the 19th century the
Constellation
outlived her uses and in</b>
      <br>
      <b>1893 was moved to the Naval station at Newport, Rhode Island.
She
served as</b>
      <br>
      <b>a stationary training ship until 1914 and for the first half
of
the</b>
      <br>
      <b>twentieth century she sat rotting. In 1940 Franklin Delano
Roosevelt</b>
      <br>
      <b>recommissioned her as the Flagship of the US Atlantic Fleet.
When
the money</b>
      <br>
      <b>for that project ran out she was towed to Boston.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1953 a committee of Maryland
citizens
collected the money needed to</b>
      <br>
      <b>get the ship home to Baltimore. The Constellation arrived in
that
it in</b>
      <br>
      <b>September of 1955 and was docked at a local ship yard to await
repairs.
This</b>
      <br>
      <b>is when stories of ghosts began to surface. Sailors standing
night
watch on</b>
      <br>
      <b>nearby ships reported odd noises and unidentifiable shapes.
The
submarine</b>
      <br>
      <b>Pike was moored closest to the Constellation and the
submariners
frequently</b>
      <br>
      <b>saw ghosts walking on the old war ship.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By December 1955 Lieutenant
Commander Allen
R. Brougham had heard lots</b>
      <br>
      <b>of these stories. He set out to investigate them. He called a
photographer</b>
      <br>
      <b>friend and asked him to come&nbsp; aboard one night with his
camera.
They set up</b>
      <br>
      <b>on a spot overlooking the ship's wheel. Very close to midnight
the
figure of</b>
      <br>
      <b>a nineteenth century US Navy Captain appeared and was captured
on
film. "It</b>
      <br>
      <b>was all over within the time he took to make a single stride."
Brougham
told</b>
      <br>
      <b>a reporter. The stunning photograph appeared in a local paper
a
few days</b>
      <br>
      <b>later. It shows a man in gold epaulets bending over slightly,
reaching</b>
      <br>
      <b>across his waist with his right hand as if to draw his sword.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some believe this figure was
Captain Thomas
Truxton, who is known to</b>
      <br>
      <b>haunt the ship. There are other spirits aboard as well. A
seaman
has been</b>
      <br>
      <b>seen running across the gun deck. Cries and moans have been
heard
in the</b>
      <br>
      <b>hold, and witnesses have heard the sound and felt the motion
of
unseen</b>
      <br>
      <b>people running about. An anonymous seaman has been spotted
sadly
wandering</b>
      <br>
      <b>around the gun deck. He is believed to be a sailor who became
overwhelmed
by</b>
      <br>
      <b>the harsh life at sea and hung himself. People have reported
smelling
gun</b>
      <br>
      <b>smoke before the appearance of some apparitions, especially of
Captain</b>
      <br>
      <b>Truxton.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carl Hansen, a mid-twentieth
century night
watchman, is believed to be</b>
      <br>
      <b>the only spirit that is actually happy aboard the ship.&nbsp;
He
cared for the</b>
      <br>
      <b>Constellation until an alarm system was installed in 1963.
Hansen's
spirit</b>
      <br>
      <b>has been seen playing cards on the lower decks. One day a
priest
came aboard</b>
      <br>
      <b>the ship and was given a tour by an enthusiastic and
knowledgeable
guide.</b>
      <br>
      <b>Before he left he praised the man's services to the staff. The
guide
didn't</b>
      <br>
      <b>fit the description of anyone working there-but it did fit
Carl
Hansen.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Constellation has been
restored several
times since she returned to</b>
      <br>
      <b>Baltimore in 1955. She most recently came back from dry dock
on
July 2,</b>
      <br>
      <b>1999. The spirits are still there. Late one evening a night
watchman
was</b>
      <br>
      <b>inspecting the ship's orlop (storage) deck. It was late and he
had
only a</b>
      <br>
      <b>flashlight to lead him through this narrow area at the bottom
of
the ship. A</b>
      <br>
      <b>misty white light appeared out of nowhere and became a sailor
in
an outdated</b>
      <br>
      <b>uniform. He walked towards the watchman. The man stood still
as
the ghost</b>
      <br>
      <b>passed through him.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The USS Constellation is docked at
Pier
1 in Baltimore's Inner Harbor.</b>
      <br>
      <b>She is open to the public and for a fee you can visit her from
10AM
to 4PM</b>
      <br>
      <b>in winter, or 10AM to 6PM in summer.</b>
