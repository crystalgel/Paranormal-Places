&nbsp; <b>The Winchester Mansion is located in San Jose
California.&nbsp;
Tours are given&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>on a daily basis, and on Halloween and every Friday the 13th
there
are&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>flashlight tours.&nbsp; The Mansion has a very interesting
history.</b>
      <br>
      <b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Sarah Winchester was once a prominent member of
the
Boston elite society.&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>After the deaths of her only child, a girl, and Sarah's
husband
who was the&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>son and heir of the man who produced the Winchester repeating
rifles,
Sarah&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>thought the reason her child and husband had died was because
the
spirits of&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>everyone killed by the Winchester rifle had taken them and
placed
a curse on&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>the Winchesters.&nbsp; The only way to appease the spirits was
to
build a mansion&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>and keep building it forever. Thus began a 38 year quest by
Sarah
Winchester&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>to not only appease the spirits but confuse them as well so
they
couldn't&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>find her.</b>
      <br>
      <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The wealthy Mrs. Winchester at the age of
44
travelled alone to San Jose&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>California to build a mansion and kept the construction for
the
next 38 years&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>until her death.&nbsp; The house at one time rose 7 stories
and
contained a maze&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>of rooms, hallways, staircases and doors.&nbsp; She named her
mystery
house Llanda&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>Villa.&nbsp; It was a 160 room mansion although Sarah closed
off
the front 30&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>rooms .&nbsp; She boarded them up after an earthquake in
1906.&nbsp;
She took the&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>earthquake as a sign that the spirits were unhappy with the
way
the&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>construction was going.&nbsp; However estimates point to over
600
rooms built and&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>demolished over a 38 year time frame.</b>
      <br>
      <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One feature of the Mansion was a bell
tower,
where the bell was rung&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>every night at about midnight to summon the spirits.&nbsp;
Sarah
would then ask&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>the good spirits how they wanted the mansion
constructed.&nbsp;
The bell would&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>again ring out at 2 am. to signal the spirits that it was time
to
leave.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>Sarah would emerge from the seance room with new plans for the
construction&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>workers.&nbsp; She claimed the good spirits gave her the plans
to
help her confuse&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>the bad spirits so they couldn't get to her.</b>
      <br>
      <b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Many psychics have spent the night at the
Winchester
Mansion hoping to&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>contact the spirits that reside there.&nbsp; They were not
disapointed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>Experiences include organ music being heard in the Blue Room
where
Sarah&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>died.&nbsp; In Sarah's bedroom cold spots are felt and red
balls
of light are seen&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>that seem to explode and fade.&nbsp; Apparitions of a couple
lingering
in the&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>corner of the bedroom clothed in servants garb dating to the
early
20th&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>century.&nbsp; The sense of being watched is also felt in many
parts
of the house.</b>
      <br>
      <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During one seance a psychic appeared to age
dramatically
and take on the&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>physical appearence of Sarah.&nbsp; Although most people who
have
felt Sarah have&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>said she is a kind and gentle spirit.</b>
      <br>
      <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A caretaker who worked at the house for
several
years said he heard&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>breathing in one room, and once had followed the sound of
footsteps
to the&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>doorway of Sarahs bedroom.&nbsp; Both instances he was
alone.&nbsp;
Another worker in&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>the house claimed to have heard his name whispered.&nbsp;
While
still others have&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>sensed being watched, hearing footsteps, and perhapes the
strangest
of all,&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>the smell of chicken soup coming from the front kitchen that
had
not been in&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>use for several years.&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apparitions of Sarh have been seen and
photographed
as well as a man in&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>overalls.&nbsp; Many episodes of lights turning off and on by
themselves
when the&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>house is empty and locked up for the night.&nbsp; Also a room
in
the house was&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>flooded, every item in the room was soaked.&nbsp; Upon further
inspection
of the&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>room the floor, the ceiling and the walls were completely dry.</b>
      <br>
      <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although Sarah Winchester lived her life in
solitude
and reclusive for&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>the last 38 years of her life, it would seem she enjoys
putting
on a show for&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>the workers and tour groups who visit her unique home now.</b><b></b>
