Haunted Mansion</font></b></center>

      <b>Hundreds of people visit the Haunted Mansion in Disneyland
every
day. In fact, it holds a record for being the most visited Dark ride
and
Disney Imagineers worked hard using old magician tricks to create these
illusions. What they may not have known was that there are now several
real ghosts haunting the place.&nbsp;</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>In the early 1950s Walt Disney and one of his top
Imagineers Ken
Anderson began working on the idea of a walk through haunted house. The
inspiration came from a Disney cartoon about the Headless Horseman. The
visitor was to enter a New England style house and follow the story
through
the attraction until it reached a climax in a graveyard scene.&nbsp;</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Anyone who has visited the attraction knows that ideas
changed and
Disney and Anderson developed a New Orleans style house that the
visitor
rides through on a "Doombuggy". It does, however, retain the graveyard
scene form the original plans.&nbsp;</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Construction of the building was put on hold in 1962, but
halted
in 1966 when Walt Disney died. The designers were in a quandary as Walt
had not finished the planning. For a few years the public could see the
frame of the building poking over the construction fence. Urban legends
surfaced about how the ride was being re-designed because it was so
scary
that it supposedly caused a man to have a heart attack. The attraction
finially opened in 1969.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>While the building was built on property that had no
previous construction
on it, it did manage to attract someone who had died nearby. In the
1940s
a man who had been piloting a small plane crashed in a lake near where
the park was to be built later. His ghost has settled into the&nbsp;
Haunted
Mansion. Referred to by Cast Members (employees) as "the man with the
cane"
he is often seen late at night, especially after closing.&nbsp;</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>"The man in a tuxedo" is another spirit, though no one
really knows
who he is. One day an employee was working in the area where passengers
disembark. There is a mirror there, so the attendant can see when the
riders
come up behind her. She kept seeing a shadow in the mirror, and when
she
turned around no one was there. The figure seemed to be wearing a
tuxedo.
Then, she felt a chill and a hand placed on her shoulder. Of course,
she
turned to find no one there. The woman ran out of the Haunted Mansion
and
soon quit her job.&nbsp;</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>There is a legend concerning a woman who wanted to scatter
her young
son's ashes inside the Haunted Mansion, but was forbidden by Disney
officials.
She snuck the ashes inside and covertly scattered them. Apparently,
this
was NOT her son's last wish as since she did that people have sometimes
seen the apparition of a crying boy sitting near the exit.&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>Though there have been many stories circulated, one person
ever
actually died in the Haunted Mansion. Each year Disneyland sponsors
"Grad
Night", which is for high school seniors. Two teenage boys were riding
along in a Doombuggy when one of them decided that he wanted to see the
room called "S&eacute;ance Circle" up close.&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>The young man stepped out on to the black painted walkway that
was
next to the tracks. What he did not realize was that there was a gap
between
the walkway and the platform on which the display sat. He stepped off
the
walkway and plunged fifteen feet to the floor, breaking his neck.&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>"S&eacute;ance Circle" has been odd since the beginning. A
sound
designer was setting up equipment in the area before the attraction was
open to the public. He kept hearing music coming from behind one of the
new walls. He surmised that a radio had been walled up accidentally.
After
several days the music had never ended and no radio announcer ever came
on. The man could never find the source of the sound, so he arranged
for
a speaker to go in the area and drown it out.</b>
      <br>
      <b>&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>There have been many legends associated with the Haunted
mansion.
If you ever visit, keep your eyes open. You may just spot a real ghost!</b>
