      <b></b>
      <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the hotheaded politicians of
Washington,
DC wanted to fight each</b>
      <br>
      <b>other, they all knew that the Bladensburg Dueling Grounds,
just
over the</b>
      <br>
      <b>Maryland line,was the best place to meet their adversary. On
the
day of a</b>
      <br>
      <b>duel, the men would set out in the wee hours of the early
morning.
They had</b>
      <br>
      <b>to travel down a dirt road and over a small bridge to an area
about
one mile</b>
      <br>
      <b>from the town of Bladensburg. The bridge ran over a stream
nicknamed
"Blood</b>
      <br>
      <b>Run. Narrow paths ran through waist high weeds. Dense willows
and
sycamores</b>
      <br>
      <b>crowded out the sky. Many prominent men met their deaths
there,
and others</b>
      <br>
      <b>were mentally crippled for life.</b>
      <br>
      <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over fifty known duels were fought.
The
earliest seem to be the one</b>
      <br>
      <b>that occured in February of 1819 between former Virginia
senator
Armistead</b>
      <br>
      <b>T. Mason and his cousin Colonel John M. Mcarty. It is believed
that
Mcarty</b>
      <br>
      <b>challenged Mason either over a woman or over Mcarty's right to
vote
in a</b>
      <br>
      <b>Virginia election. Mcarty had all kinds of crazy challenges
for
Mason. He</b>
      <br>
      <b>wanted to fight with daggers or jump from a lighted keg of
powder.
The two</b>
      <br>
      <b>finally settled on dueling with muskets.</b>
      <br>
      <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The opposing factors met at
Bladensburg,
each bringing their own</b>
      <br>
      <b>supporters. Soon Mcarty and Mason were set up at twelve paces
apart.
When</b>
      <br>
      <b>the shots were fired, Mason was killed instantly. Mcarty was
shot
in the</b>
      <br>
      <b>hand, and in a bizarre twist of fate the bullet traveled up
his
arm and out</b>
      <br>
      <b>his shoulder.</b>
      <br>
      <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mcarty lost the ability to use his
right
arm. He also lost his mind. He</b>
      <br>
      <b>never recovered from murdering his cousin. Mcarty stopped
shaving,
cutting</b>
      <br>
      <b>his hair, and even bathing. After he died, people reported his
disheveled</b>
      <br>
      <b>ghost wandering around the weed choked area where he killed
Armistead
Mason.</b>
      <br>
      <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephen Decatur was a Naval hero who
had
distinguished himself in three</b>
      <br>
      <b>different wars, but he too was murdered on the fields of
Bladensburg.
In</b>
      <br>
      <b>1820 Decatur was living the quiet life. He settled on
Lafayette
Square in</b>
      <br>
      <b>Washington, DC with his wife. This was the worst time for
Commodore
James</b>
      <br>
      <b>Barron to challenge him to a duel.</b>
      <br>
      <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There had been bad blood between
Decatur
and Barron for a long time.</b>
      <br>
      <b>Barron had been put on trial to be court-martialed after an
incident
at sea.</b>
      <br>
      <b>&nbsp; A British ship commander had insisted that Barron turn
over
some Americans</b>
      <br>
      <b>that he believed were British deserters. Barron refused, and
the
British</b>
      <br>
      <b>ship fired on Barron's, killing three men and wounding eight.
The
British</b>
      <br>
      <b>then seized the suspected deserters. This led not only to
Barron's</b>
      <br>
      <b>suspension for five years, but to the War of 1812.</b>
      <br>
      <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Barron applied for reinstatement
in
the Navy Decatur was</b>
      <br>
      <b>outspokenly opposed, and he had the power to keep Barron out.
The
two men</b>
      <br>
      <b>corresponded for several years, with Barron growing
increasingly
bitter.</b>
      <br>
      <b>Finally, with Decatur in the same town as he, Barron
challenger
Decatur to a</b>
      <br>
      <b>duel at eight paces with pistols.</b>
      <br>
      <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The night before the fight Decatur
shut
himself in his bedroom and</b>
      <br>
      <b>spent hours at the window gazing at his property. When dawn
came
the next</b>
      <br>
      <b>morning Decatur slipped out of the house with the black box
containing
his</b>
      <br>
      <b>dueling pistols. It was March 18, 1820.</b>
      <br>
      <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the rules, no man could
fire
before the count of one, or</b>
      <br>
      <b>after the count of three. Two shots were fired at the count of
three.
Barron</b>
      <br>
      <b>took a bullet in his hip. Decatur was struck in the right
side.
His</b>
      <br>
      <b>supporters carried him back to his home on Lafayette Square,
where
he died.</b>
      <br>
      <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some believe that Decatur is one of
the
ghosts lurking around the old</b>
      <br>
      <b>dueling area, but he has been spotted more frequently at his
home.
One year</b>
      <br>
      <b>after he was killed he was seen gazing mournfully out of his
window,
just as</b>
      <br>
      <b>he did on the night before he died. His wife was so upset that
she
ordered</b>
      <br>
      <b>the window walled up, but he still appears.</b>
      <br>
      <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another spirit known to wander
underneath
the overgrown trees is Daniel</b>
      <br>
      <b>Key, one of the sons of Francis Scott Key. In June of 1836 Key
and
his</b>
      <br>
      <b>friend John Sherborne were returning home aboard&nbsp; a ship.
All
the way home</b>
      <br>
      <b>the two young men argued about the speed of two steam boats.
When
they</b>
      <br>
      <b>arrived in DC, they met at Bladensburg. Key was killed at age
20.</b>
      <br>
      <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the period&nbsp; when Key was
killed
the public began to get upset</b>
      <br>
      <b>over the bloodshed at Bladensburg. Unless they had a fight to
go
to, people</b>
      <br>
      <b>avoided the area. tales of ghostly moans and groans
circulated.
Others saw</b>
      <br>
      <b>apparitions wandering around. Dueling was outlawed in
Maryland,
but this did</b>
      <br>
      <b>not affect residents of DC. Washington lawmakers did not want
an
antidueling</b>
      <br>
      <b>law because so many of them believed in the codes associated
with
it.</b>
      <br>
      <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Congress had no choice but to act
after
February 1838 when Maine</b>
      <br>
      <b>representative John Cilley was killed by Congressman William
Graves.
Graves</b>
      <br>
      <b>was a stand in for James W. Webb, a New York newspaper editor.
Webb
was</b>
      <br>
      <b>offended by some of the remarks Cilley made in the House. He
assigned
the</b>
      <br>
      <b>duel to Graves, who was his friend as well as a noted
marksman.
Cilley was a</b>
      <br>
      <b>hard working man who preferred to spend time with his family.
He
didn't even</b>
      <br>
      <b>really know the men who were challenging him. Cilley quietly
went
about his</b>
      <br>
      <b>business while Graves practiced his shooting.</b>
      <br>
      <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At dawn on the appointed day Graves
showed
up with a more powerful</b>
      <br>
      <b>rifle that Cilley, but he was allowed to use it. When ready,
the
men fired.</b>
      <br>
      <b>No one was hit. They fired at each other a second time, but
still
no one was</b>
      <br>
      <b>hit. The seconds and spectators tried to end the confrontation
but
Graves</b>
      <br>
      <b>wouldn't consent. The third time Cilley was hit in the leg.
Because
a main</b>
      <br>
      <b>artery was severed he quickly bled to death in front of some
of
Washington's</b>
      <br>
      <b>most prominent citizens and politicians. Cilley's confused
ghost
still</b>
      <br>
      <b>wanders around the area when he died.</b>
      <br>
      <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cilley's death finally led to the
outlawing
of dueling in Washington,</b>
      <br>
      <b>DC. Men didn't heed the regulations and they still murdered
each
other in</b>
      <br>
      <b>the fields after dark. Finally, the Civil War put an end to
dueling
in the</b>
      <br>
      <b>area. Everyone had had enough of the bloodshed and violence.</b>
      <br>
      <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; People avoided the area because of
the
history and the ghosts. One day</b>
      <br>
      <b>a boy saw a figure among the trees. The spirit had his head
down
and was</b>
      <br>
      <b>dressed in black. When the boy approached the figure, it
disappeared.
The</b>
      <br>
      <b>ghost could have been anyone of the hundreds of men whose
lives
were changed</b>
      <br>
      <b>there. Not much of the old dueling fields are left now. There
are
some</b>
      <br>
      <b>trees, many weeds, and a lot of ghost stories.</b><b></b>
