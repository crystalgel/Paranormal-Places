      <p><b>While many people may not think of a modern superstore as
being haunted,
the&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>Toys&#8217;R&#8217;Us haunting reminds us that every plot of ground has a
history.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>Built in 1970, the toy store is a 60,000 square foot one story
building.
It&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>is located thirty miles South of San Francisco, at 130 East El
Camino,
in&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>Sunnyvale, CA. This was once an apple orchard, and part of a
huge
ranch&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>owned by John Murphy during the late 1800s.</b>
      <br>
      <b>Paranormal activity occurs regularly at this site. Typically,
employees&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>unlock the store in the morning and find toys and books
scattered
about when&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>they had been neatly shelved the night before. Sometimes,
objects
fly&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>through the air or simply end up in a different place. People
have
reported&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>being touched when no one is around. Also, some have heard a
voice
that they&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>didn&#8217;t recognize calling their name. Aisle 15C sometimes
smells
of fresh&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>flowers.</b>
      <br>
      <b>Many employees and customers have reported incidents that have
occurred
in&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>the women&#8217;s bathroom. The water faucets start pouring when no
one
else is&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>around. If turned off, they go on again. Women have reported
being
tapped on&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>the shoulder. Those with long hair sometimes feel it being
stroked
by&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>someone that they can&#8217;t see.</b>
      <br>
      <b>Though incidents had been occurring for some time, the store
was
not&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>investigated until 1978, when local writer An-tionette May
took
an interest&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>in the ghost. May invited psychic Sylvia Brown, a
photographer,
and several&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>others to spend a night at the store.</b>
      <br>
      <b>The group expected the ghost to be of John Murphy, the lands
original
owner.&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>The first impression that Brown picked up was of a tall, lanky
man
with his&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>hands jammed in to his pockets. The ghost spoke with a Swedish
accent
and&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>said that his name was Johnny Johnson. He warned Brown that if
she
didn&#8217;t&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>want her feet wet she had better move. (Records show that a
well
once stood&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>on that spot.) She reported that Johnson was waiting for
someone
named Beth.</b>
      <br>
      <b>Johnny Johnson lived in Pennsylvania before coming west
sometime
in the&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>mid-1800s. While in California he worked as a circuit
preacher.
Johnson&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>became inflicted with encephalitis (inflammation of the
brain),
which left&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>him with a mental handicap. Because of this he was called
"Crazy
Johnny".&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>Johnson ended up working as a hired hand on the Murphy ranch.</b>
      <br>
      <b>The woman that Johnson is waiting for was Elizabeth Yuba
Murphy
Tafee,&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>otherwise known as Beth. Johnny apparently had a crush on this
lady,
only to&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>find that she had left the ranch to marry a lawyer from the
East
Coast.</b>
      <br>
      <b>Johnson died in 1884. He bled to death when he accidentally
cut
his leg&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>chopping wood. (Some versions of the story say it was his
neck.)
This&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>occurred on the spot where the Toys&#8217;R&#8217;Us stands today. Though
Johnson
was&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>about eighty when he died, he has appeared to witnesses as a
young
man in&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>his twenties or thirties.</b>
      <br>
      <b>At this writing the store is still haunted and the management
has
no plans&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>to get rid of the ghost. While some employees are afraid,
others
seem to&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>enjoy Johnson&#8217;s residence. The manager claims that sales
increase
whenever&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>the media reports on the ghost.</b>
      <br>
      <b>This haunting has been very well documented. Sylvia Brown has
been
back to&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>the store many times. Johnson&#8217;s activities have been written
about
in books&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>and newspapers, and the store has been featured on several TV
shows.
