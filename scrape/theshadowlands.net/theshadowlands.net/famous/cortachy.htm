      <b></b>
      <p><b>Cortachy Castle, family seat of the Ogilvy Clan, is located
north
of Kirriemuir in Angus, Scotland.&nbsp; The Ogilvy ancestors became the
1st Earls of Angus after Scotland became a united country and their
active
participation in aiding William the Lion.&nbsp; It is reported that
members
of Ogilvy Clan assisted King William the Lion who was ambushed and
attacked
while out hunting.&nbsp; As a reward for the assistance and their being
staunch supporters of the monarchs, William the Lion awarded lands and
titles to the Ogilvy Clan.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>During the next three to four centuries the Ogilvy Clan
grew more
and more powerful with each marriage that added more money and
lands.&nbsp;
Ogilvy Clan became extremely powerful and influential and as is the
case
they attracted enemies who resented their influence and power.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>The Ogilvy's were met with powerful enemies that attacked
their strongholds
and with the exception of Cortachy Castle, they were all brought down.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Earthly enemies were not enough for the Earl of
Ogilvy.&nbsp; During
the medieval times it is said that a drummer and his drum were thrown
from
the highest turret of the highest tower.&nbsp; Some reports indicate
that
the young drummer was forcibly stuffed inside his drum and then tossed
from the tower surviving the fall long enough to curse the Ogilvy
Clan.&nbsp;
Whether his punishment was a result of a romantic liaison with the
Earls
wife, the Countess of Airlie, or the drummer siding with the enemy
allowing
them to enter the castle without</b>
      <br>
      <b>beating out a warning is unknown.&nbsp; One thing is for
certain,
he now beats his drum to warn the Ogilvy Clan.&nbsp; He warns them of
an
impending Ogilvy death.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>For hundreds of years, the Ogilvy Clan has been haunted by
a ghostly
drumming that is heard by many witnesses.&nbsp; At Christmas time in
1844
a Miss Dalrymple was a guest at the castle.&nbsp; The evening Miss
Dalrymple
arrived she heard the beating of a drum as she dressed for
dinner.&nbsp;
During dinner she questioned her host about the identity of the
drummer.&nbsp;
The Lord and Lady Airlie paled at this question and told Miss Dalrymple
that the last time the drummer was heard, the first Lady Airlie died
shortly
after.&nbsp; The next morning, Miss Dalrymple was treated to another
serenade
by drummer.&nbsp; Spooked, Miss Dalrymple fled the castle
immediately.&nbsp;
Within six months, Lady Airlie died apparently by her own hand as there
was a note left indicating that she knew the Drummer was beating for
her.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>It was on August 19, 1849 that the drummer gave another
serenade
to a visiting Englishman.&nbsp; The Englishman was the guest of Lord
Ogilvy,
the heir to the Earldom of Airlie.&nbsp; The Englishman questioned
several
about the drumming only to be told they heard nothing.&nbsp; Before the
Englishman could question Lord Ogilvy about the drummer, he was told
that
the 9th Earl of Airlie had become seriously ill requiring Lord Ogilvy's
presence.&nbsp; The 9th Earl died the next day.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>In 1900 the succeeding Earl died during the Boer War of
1900.&nbsp;
No one near the Earl admits to having heard the beating of a
drum.&nbsp;
Since this Earl's death, no one else has reported hearing the
mysterious
beating of the drum.&nbsp; Could it be that the drummer felt he had had
carried the curse out long enough?</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>People who have reviewed this case list it as a crisis
manifestation
and is frequently referred to as a poltergeist haunting focusing on the
Earls of Airlies, Ogilvy's and Castle Cortachy.&nbsp; I somehow doubt
the
drummer was actually stuffed inside his drum before being tossed from
the
tower, but I have no doubt that the drummer was tossed WITH his drum
from
the tower.</b><b></b>
