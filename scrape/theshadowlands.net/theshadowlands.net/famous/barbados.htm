      <p><b>Often called the case of the moving coffins, the Chase
family crypt
in Barbados was the location of an unusual haunting.&nbsp; During the
years
of 1812 to 1820, the six solid&nbsp; lead coffins were found thrown
around
the sealed solid rock crypt after people&nbsp; reported hearing strange
sounds coming from the crypt.&nbsp; Each time the crypt was&nbsp;
opened,
the coffins put back to their original locations and sealed again.&nbsp;</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>This case was investigated by Lord Comberemere, the
Governor of Barbados
at&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>the time.&nbsp; In July 1819 Lord Comberemere conducted a
test.&nbsp;
The tomb was opened&nbsp; and the locations of the coffins were
sketched
(picture above).&nbsp; The crypt was then sealed and an additional slab
of marble that took 4 men to lift was put in the entrance.&nbsp; In
April
of 1820, noise were again heard from the sealed crypt.&nbsp; The&nbsp;
crypt was opened and the coffins were found moved about the inside of
the
crypt.&nbsp;&nbsp; After examining this, Lord Comberemere ordered all
the
coffins removed from the crypt and buried separately on the grounds of
the cemetery of Christ Church.</b>
