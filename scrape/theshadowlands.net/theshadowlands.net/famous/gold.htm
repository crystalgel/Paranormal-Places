      <p><b>Elizabeth's last moments were of torture and terror.&nbsp;
Chained
to the radiator in Room 109, the prostitute carrying the child of the
Goldfield
Hotel's owner, George Winfield, cried out in the night for mercy but
found
only emptiness.&nbsp; As soon as the child was born, it was ripped from
her hands and disposed of down the chute of the abandoned gold mine
over
which the hotel was built.&nbsp; Psychics say Elizabeth was either left
to die there or was murdered soon afterwards, nonetheless, her spirit
is
trapped within the small room.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>A reporter from the Las Vegas Sun came to research more
about the
entity in 1984, seventy-six years after the hotel opened.&nbsp; Taking
a photograph of the room, he reported later that it was intensely cold
and that floating near the ceiling was the image of a girl with long
flowing
hair.&nbsp; Later, the Lt. Governor was being shown the property and
the
guests were taking photographs all over the building.&nbsp; Only in
Room
109, the cameras refused to work and they were left with nothing.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>On the first floor, the George Winfield Room is said to be
haunted
by his shade, the smell of cigar smoke and ashes being found
periodically.&nbsp;
Once, fresh ashes were discovered within a fuse box that had not been
opened
in over 50 years.&nbsp; Winfield's presence has also been felt by the
giant
lobby staircase, along with that of a midget and two small
children.&nbsp;
In the Gold Room, a ghost seems to stab people as they visit, not
terribly
neighborly of him&#8230;</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Some psychics say the Goldfield Hotel is one of the seven
portals
to the other side.&nbsp; At the time of this writing (February 2001)
the
hotel is up for sale for the bargain price of $427,000 in back
taxes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b><b></b>
