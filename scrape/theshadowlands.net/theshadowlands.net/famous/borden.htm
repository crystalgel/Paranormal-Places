      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Now a bed and breakfast located in Fall River
Massachutes.&nbsp;
As children we&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>all heard the poem.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Lizzie Borden took an ax,</b>
      <br>
      <b>She gave her mother 40 whacks,</b>
      <br>
      <b>When she seen what she had done,</b>
      <br>
      <b>She gave her father 41.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course Elizabeth Borden was the prime
suspect in
the murder of her father&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>and step-mother. But she had a good lawyer and was
aqquitted.&nbsp;
Her house now&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>turned Bed and Breakfast is very active with spirits.</b>
      <br>
      <b>&nbsp;&nbsp; The marriage between Andrew Borden and Abbey
Durfee
Gray was not exactly a&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>love match, but one of convenience.&nbsp; Andrew needed a
housekeeper
and mother&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>for his girls Lizzie and Emma.&nbsp; And Abby's prospects for
a
husband were&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>dwindling and although a miser, Andrew was a rich catch.</b>
      <br>
      <b>&nbsp;&nbsp; There was no love lost between the girls and
Abbey,
before the murders the&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>grown girls had been referring to Abbey as Mrs. Borden, and
refusing
to be a&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>family.&nbsp; They basically lived all together in the same
house
as strangers,&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>the girls secluding themselves behind locked doors.</b>
      <br>
      <b>&nbsp;&nbsp; The day of the murders the only people around the
house
were Lizzie,&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>Andrew, Abbey and the maid, who was outside washing windows
and
gossiping&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>with the neighboring maid. Lizzie claimed to be outside also,
eating
pears&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>underneath the pear tree during the time of the murders. Abbey
was
killed in&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>the guest bedroom while changing sheets on the bed.&nbsp;
Andrew
was killed about&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>90 minutes later in the sitting/living room while napping on
the
couch.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>Lizzie was later seen by the maid burning a dress in the
back-yard.</b>
      <br>
      <b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Much controversy surrounds the murders and many
different
theories are out&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>there about the murders. Is it any wonder the house is
reportedly
haunted.</b>
      <br>
      <b>&nbsp; Cold spots are felt in many of the rooms.&nbsp; Abbey
has
been known to climb&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>into the guests beds sometimes with them, other times in plain
view.&nbsp;
She&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>also has been seen dusting and making the beds in many of the
houses
rooms.</b>
      <br>
      <b>&nbsp;&nbsp; People who work in the house say they hear voices
and
opening and closing&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>of doors.&nbsp; Other people have heard arguements between two
female
voices, and&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>women crying.&nbsp; While still others tell of unexplained
footsteps.&nbsp;
The history&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>and mystery of the house would certainly make this house a
prime
candidate&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>for a haunting.</b>
