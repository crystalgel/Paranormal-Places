      <p><b>I've been to the Queen Mary on several occaisions, and
encountered
more</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>than one of the phenomenon aboard.</b>&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p><b>The most accessible haunted area is near door 13 in the
engine room,</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>where a young man was crushed trying to escape a fire. He was
only
17</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>and had lied about his age in order to get the job. We've
heard
knocking</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>from the pipes around the door on more than one occaision,
once
it</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>progressed in a circle all the way around our group. Another
time,
two</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>of our group saw a bright light with smoke in front of it as
with
a</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>fire. The woman also felt heat from the doorway, when she
touched
it. We</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>had not informed them of the haunting before.</b>&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p><b>Another of the accessible haunting areas is the front desk
of what
is</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>now the hotel portion of the ship. Sightings include a
mysterious
woman</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>in white who will be sighted walking until blocked from view
by
a pillar</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>and never coming out from behind. Also, a couple has been seen
walking</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>down the hall to either side of the main entry to the first
class
rooms,</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>but are never seen in the hallways themselves.</b>&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p><b>Some other areas that you have to take the behind the
scenes tour
to get</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>to include the engine room number 2. Many stowaways died every
time
they</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>would fire up the boilers to leave port, and sometimes a
feeling
of vast</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>despair can be felt on the catwalk and sometimes also on the</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>shuffleboard deck above. Also, I've noticed that when I'm
there,
the</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>room feels much larger than it is. I can also occaisionally
feel
the</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>ship sway, which it doesn't do now that it's moored.</b>&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p><b>There are several hauntings related to the pool, including
two different</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>children, one girl who asks after her mother or her doll, and
a
boy. The</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>girl is thought to have been a precocious child from third
class
who</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>liked sliding down bannisters and was doing so when the ship
hit
a swell</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>and pitched so that the bannister went straight down and she
hit
the</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>wall, breaking her neck. There have also been complaints about
a
smell</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>that would be from when the ship was in use to move troops
during
WWII,</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>and many of them were triple bunked in the pool itself, and
many
of the</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>soldiers were prone to seasickness. The third is a 'vortex'
that
is</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>located in the hallway of the changing rooms. It has been
featured
on</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>tv, and it's location was once confirmed by an employee, who
correctly</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>moved the chair back to the position where the psychic from
the
tv show</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>had placed it. The position of the vortex is almost directly
beneath
the</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>revolving door that was originally used as the entrance to the
pool</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>area. My group encountered something in this area when we went
through</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>it. I and the guide had gone around rather than going in,
while
my</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>husband, and our two friends went through the hallway. About a
minute</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>later, (it only takes about ten seconds to get from one end to
the</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>other) I looked in and saw the three of them. My husband was
almost
all</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>the way through, one friend was in the middle, where the
vortex
is, and</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>the third was just behind her. When I pulled back from
looking,
our</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>female friend screamed and the three of them hustled out of
the
hall. My</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>husband said that he had looked and seen three people behind
him
at</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>about the same time I had looked in from the other side, and
he
had</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>assumed that I was with them (I hadn't told them I wasn't
going
through</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>with them). The woman with us told us that at the site of the
vortex,</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>she couldn't move and tried to scream but couldn't, then felt
a
touch on</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>her shoulder, screamed, and they came out of the hallway. The
other
man,</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>her boyfriend at the time, had followed behind them and when
she
stopped</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>moving, he was going to nudge her forward, and that's when she
screamed,</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>when he touched her shoulder. He saw when I looked in to see
what
was</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>keeping them, and he also saw three others in the hallway,
thinking
that</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>our guide was one of them. Both my husband and he described
the
mystery</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>person as about 5'6" with medium length, curly hair.</b>&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p><b>The girl at the pool is also commonly seen around the third
class</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>stairwell, near the door to the old nursery.</b>&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p><b>We once took the ghost tour, four years ago, Halloween, and
they
no</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>longer have that tour, which is a shame.</b>&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p><b>It included all of the places mentioned above as well as
two others.
One</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>is for to the fore of the ship and is characterized by a man
screaming</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>for help and sometimes just by his moaning in pain. This comes
from</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>during WWII. The ship wouldn't publish it's sailing patterns
to
avoid</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>possible attack from German submarines. During one of these
trips</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>heading to Europe, the Queen Mary hit another, much smaller
ship,</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>broadsiding it. The other ship was cut nearly in two by the
force.
The</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>Queen Mary itself sustained little damage. When the ship
reached
port,</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>it was sent to dry dock to repair the hull, the outer section
of
which</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>had been badly torn. When the drained the water, the found the
body
of a</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>man who had been thrown through a hole torn in the hull above
the
water</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>line from the other ship and had died of exposure. Many techs
who
work</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>in that area don't like to go alone, or at night.</b>&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p><b>The other is a cabin. For this one, the guide turned out
the lights
of</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>the room and just used her flashlight. She had the entire
group
enter</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>(there were eight of us) and closed the door. While she told
us
the</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>story of the room, I could feel the ship swaying heavily and
actully
had</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>to catch my balance at one point. The story behind the room is
that</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>during one crossing, a man checked in at the desk, and his
luggage
was</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>stowed. That night he asked one of the stewards if they could
find
a</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>female companion for the night and gave the steward a small
wad
of</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>bills. The steward found a willing companion and she and the
passenger</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>retired for the night. The next morning when the man didn't
come
to the</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>dining room for breakfast, the steward knocked at his room.
After</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>receiving no answer, he fetched the head steward who opened
the
room.</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>The walls and bed were covered in the blood of the woman, who
had
been</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>murdered. A check of the registrar revealed that there had
been
no</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>passenger assigned to the room, and when they looked for his
luggage,</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>there was none to be found, even though many people remember
it
being</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>checked and stowed. I was distinctly uncomfortable during the
telling,</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>and almost panicky by the time she turned the lights back on.</b>&nbsp;
