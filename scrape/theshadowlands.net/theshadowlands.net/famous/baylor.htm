      <p><b>Imagine walking through the old Baylor&#8217;s Massacre site in
River Vale
NJ, where in 1778 members of the local militia known as Baylor&#8217;s
Dragoons
were slaughtered by German Hessians. These men were just like any other
men with at least one exception. They left their homes and families to
fight for the independence of a fledgling nation and gave their lives
to
the spirit of liberty.</b>
      <br>
      <b>&nbsp;As they slept, the German mercenaries crept upon the
camp
and butchered the patriots. This event went unnoticed until development
unearthed the graves. But there is more than a simple fence cordoning
off
the area that outlines the grounds consecrated by their ultimate
sacrifice.
The event itself seems to replay from time to time.</b>
      <br>
      <b>&nbsp;Local stories abound concerning strange happenings in
the
massacre site while the author experienced it for himself on a warm
summer&#8217;s
eve. The sighting was corroborated by two others present that night.
What
was witnessed were numerous apparitions moving through the woods as if
to stealthily creep upon some unseen prey. Although dark and shadowy,
the
attire could be ascertained as that of the era of the revolution,
particularly
that of the Hessians.</b>
      <br>
      <b>&nbsp;As these apparitions moved from tree to tree, some
crouching
as if to hide, no sound was made. As the three individuals stared
incredulously
at these men, they began to make their way toward the woodline, only to
feel a marked drop in temperature and a sudden feeling of foreboding.
The
sensation of knowing if they continued, very bad things would happen.
Without
saying a word, they stared at these men of another time only to watch
them
fade away as the temperature regained it&#8217;s summer comfort.</b>
      <br>
      <b>&nbsp;Although somewhat unnerving, I later came to the
realization
of what I had truly witnessed. Yes, I feel we saw numerous ghosts, but
the revelation was more than that. We had witnessed a part of an event
that had taken place 217 years prior. Not only had I read the little
sign
erected to commemorate the site, not only had I read about the militia
in my area from the war for independence; I had actually witnessed the
preface of the massacre.</b>
      <br>
      <b>&nbsp;Many people feel the best way to learn about history is
to
talk to those who lived it. My grandmother was a wealth of information
concerning stories from the &#8216;Old Country&#8217; and stories about my
grandfather&#8217;s
involvement in the first world war. Given our biological frailty, it
becomes
impossible to speak with those from an era long passed. Or is it?</b>
      <br>
      <b>&nbsp;Think about a ghostly apparition witnessed on a
battlefield
of your choosing. What are you seeing? Perhaps you are discomforted in
seeing what shouldn&#8217;t be, but keep in mind that you are also seeing
someone&#8217;s
father, brother, or son who lost their life upon such a field. Tears
were
shed for their loss, or perhaps their sweetheart went to her death
never
knowing what happened to her love.</b>
      <br>
      <b>&nbsp;Of course you can&#8217;t sit and have tea with these spirits
while
discussing firsthand accounts of their struggle, but with a little
after
thought, the sighting becomes more than just a great tale to spin
around
a campfire. You may have seen a ghost, but you also have briefly seen
firsthand
something that you were only able to read about prior.</b>
