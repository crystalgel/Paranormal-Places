      <b><br>
Scotland is a wonderfully scenic country known for it&#8217;s<br>
beauty, traditions, and folklore.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also known as a</b>
      <div><b>land of restless spirits.&nbsp;&nbsp;One such locale
known for it&#8217;s</b></div>
      <div><b>ghosts and tragic past is the famed Hermitage Castle
located</b></div>
      <div><b>near New Castleton, Roxburgshire Scotland.&nbsp;&nbsp;The
castle was</b></div>
      <div><b>built under the guidance of the master mason John Lewin of</b></div>
      <div><b>Durham sometime in the 13th century
(aboutscotland).&nbsp;&nbsp;The</b></div>
      <div><b>castle itself is isolated, oppressive, and is unique in
the</b></div>
      <div><b>sense that there are very few
windows.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the</b></div>
      <div><b>oppressiveness of the castle is daunting, the beauty of
the</b></div>
      <div><b>land surrounding it is breath taking.&nbsp;&nbsp;During
the 1400&#8217;s the</b></div>
      <div><b>castle was considered to be a strategically vital location</b></div>
      <div><b>resulting in battles between the English and Scots for
it&#8217;s</b></div>
      <div><b>possession.</b></div>
      <div><b>&nbsp;</b></div>
      <div><b>In 1560 Mary, Queen of Scots, visited this impressive
castle</b></div>
      <div><b>and nearly died of a fever while there.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the
13th</b></div>
      <div><b>century, Redcap Sly, a familiar spirit of the Baron de</b></div>
      <div><b>Soulis, made his presence known.&nbsp;&nbsp;Baron de
Soulis practiced</b></div>
      <div><b>black magic and performed sacrificial rituals, which left</b></div>
      <div><b>the local villages grieving for their innocent children.</b></div>
      <div><b>The farm children were kept in his dungeon for heinous</b></div>
      <div><b>torturing and ritual sacrifices.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was Recap
Sly, a long</b></div>
      <div><b>fanged old man, who told Lord Soulis that no one could</b></div>
      <div><b>injure him or bind him unless they used a three stranded</b></div>
      <div><b>rope of sand. The heartless Lord Soulis was thus given the</b></div>
      <div><b>feeling of being invulnerable to the laws of man (Guiley).</b></div>
      <div><b>&nbsp;</b></div>
      <div><b>The villagers sought release from the evil Lord Soulis.</b></div>
      <div><b>They sought out the wise Wizard Thomas of Ercildoune with</b></div>
      <div><b>their pleas and begged him to aid them.&nbsp;&nbsp;The
wizard Thomas</b></div>
      <div><b>pondered their problem and created a belt of lead, which</b></div>
      <div><b>would also hold sand.&nbsp;&nbsp;Placing the belt around
the sleeping</b></div>
      <div><b>Baron, the Wizard poured sand into the belt imprisoning
the</b></div>
      <div><b>vile Baron.</b></div>
      <div><b>&nbsp;</b></div>
      <div><b>Once restrained the Baron was taken to an ancient stone</b></div>
      <div><b>circle, Nine Stane Rig, located two miles northeast of the</b></div>
      <div><b>castle and boiled to death in a huge cauldron</b></div>
      <div><b>(aboutscotland).&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, there are multiple
endings for</b></div>
      <div><b>the vile Baron.&nbsp;&nbsp;One story has it that the
enraged parents</b></div>
      <div><b>bound him in chains further encasing him a blanket of lead</b></div>
      <div><b>and before boiling him alive.&nbsp;&nbsp;Another story
has Soulis</b></div>
      <div><b>abducting the Laird of Branxholm, a crime that led to his</b></div>
      <div><b>being bound in a sheet of lead and then boiled to his
death</b></div>
      <div><b>(Guiley).&nbsp;&nbsp;Regardless of how the nefarious
Baron met his</b></div>
      <div><b>fate; it is safe to say he deserved it!</b></div>
      <div><b>&nbsp;</b></div>
      <div><b>The castle is a tourist attraction now with the very core
of</b></div>
      <div><b>the castle sealed off.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many report they have
heard screams</b></div>
      <div><b>and pleadings of young children believed to the ghostly</b></div>
      <div><b>spirits of the Baron&#8217;s victims who remain trapped within
the</b></div>
      <div><b>oppressive walls.</b></div>
      <div><b>&nbsp;</b></div>
      <div><b>Prior to the building of the castle it is believed that
the</b></div>
      <div><b>small mound next to the ruined chapel a quarter of a mile</b></div>
      <div><b>from the northwest corner of the castle lies the grave of</b></div>
      <div><b>the giant, Cout O&#8217; Keilder.&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant was
known to</b></div>
      <div><b>terrorize the area and wore an enchanted chain-mail that</b></div>
      <div><b>left him unaffected by blows.&nbsp;&nbsp;The giant met
his fate when</b></div>
      <div><b>he was drowned in the deep pool of water in the river
called</b></div>
      <div><b>the drowning pool.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is said that
the giant still walks</b></div>
      <div><b>the area searching for those that drowned him</b></div>
      <div><b>(aboutscotland).</b></div>
      <div><b>&nbsp;</b></div>
      <div><b>Given the tragic history of Hermitage Castle, it is within</b></div>
      <div><b>reason to believe that spirits would still linger in this</b></div>
      <div><b>oppressive and isolated castle that has fallen into ruin.</b></div>
      <div><b>It is a common belief that tragic deaths will often allow</b></div>
      <div><b>spirits to dwell or leave a "residue" in which the acts
are</b></div>
      <div><b>forever replayed as if burned into the atmosphere of the</b></div>
      <div><b>place.</b></div>
      <div><b>&nbsp;</b></div>
      <div><b>Are there ghosts in this castle?&nbsp;&nbsp;Why wouldn&#8217;t
there be?</b></div>
      <div><b>Given the number of children who died, the practice of
black</b></div>
      <div><b>magic, and the evilness that dwelled within the walls
would</b></div>
      <div><b>most surely guarantee that the castle would be
haunted.&nbsp;&nbsp;It</b></div>
      <div><b>is sad really, that such a beautiful area marred by such</b></div>
      <div><b>tragedy and evilness.</b></div>
