      <p>&nbsp;<b>Outside the village of Haarzuilens in the province of
Utrecht,
in the middle of an enormous park stands the most famous castle of the
Netherlands, De Haar Castle. In 1890 Baron Etienne van Zuylen van
Nijevelt
inherited the ruins of the castle, which was originaly build in the
thirteenth
century. Although living in France he decided to rebuild the house. He
was married to H&eacute;l&egrave;ne de Rothschild, the daughter of a
very
wealthy Paris banker, and she decided to pay the restoration as a
wedding-gift.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>&nbsp; They commissioned P.J.H. Cuijpers, the famous
architect, to
undertake the gigantic project. They thought it would take about two
years
to finish, it became twenty. The castle was rebuild in Neo-Gothic style
in a very personal version.&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>A funny detail in the interior of the Knights' Hall is that
they
made hooks onto the ceiling. This was ment to capture ghosts, which
were
flying through the house. They got hooked up with their white sheets
and
couldn't free themselves anymore. Then the sun came in at morning,
which
made them disappear.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>&nbsp; Originaly the house was build next to the village,
but the
baron wanted a huge garden and therefore the village had to move. They
pulled down the whole village except for the church, which became the
chapel
of the castle, and rebuild it two kilometre further on. The baron also
wanted a park with huge, grown-up trees, so they moved 4000 big trees
from
the Hillback of Utrecht to the park. Some of the houses in Utrecht had
to be demolished otherwise the trees couldn't pass. No problem, money
didn't
matter. Nowadays they have a problem, because the new house is much too
heavy for the old foundations and they can't keep it any longer. The
castle
is sagging and the restoration is going to cost 50 million guilders,
that's
a lot of money. But now the property is bought by the Union of
Monuments
of Nature and perhaps they can manage the restoration.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>&nbsp; In the fifteenth century a knight called Coenraed
was living
at the castle. He was a very selfish man who didn't believe in God or
anything
and he didn't care for anyone. One day he came back riding on his horse
in full armery when he heard a voice asking for food and a place for
the
night to stay. The knight shook his head and rode on. The beggar
shouted
at him: "I'm also a human being!" The knight went mad and wanted to hit
the man, turning he gave his horse the spurs, but it misstepped and
they
ended up in the moat. The knight drowned because of his heavy armery.
His
ghost is still seen around the castle.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>But ghost or no ghost, visiting the castle is worth while.</b><b></b>
