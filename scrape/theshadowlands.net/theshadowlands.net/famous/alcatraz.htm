      <p><b>Welcome to HAUNTED ALCATRAZ!---or Hellcatraz as it was
called by
some</b>
      <br>
      <b>inmates. The history does not begin or end with the use of
Alcatraz
as a</b>
      <br>
      <b>prison and penitentiary, for it was known to Native Americans,
and</b>
      <br>
      <b>avoided as a place that contained evil sprits. The energy of
those
who</b>
      <br>
      <b>came to "The Rock" and never left, still remains for visitors
from</b>
      <br>
      <b>around the world to see, feel, and even hear. Alcatraz is a
portal
to</b>
      <br>
      <b>another dimension, where unexplainable events continue to
occur.</b>
      <br>
      <b>Whoever, or whatever lurks in the shadows can be heard, seen,
and
felt.</b>
      <br>
      <b>As parapsychologists suggest, where so much trauma and
negative
emotion</b>
      <br>
      <b>have occurred, there is bound to be residual energy---and
Alcatraz
has</b>
      <br>
      <b>the feel of an immense haunted house, complete with fog, and
restless</b>
      <br>
      <b>spirits. Although the candle may have burned out for Alcatraz
long
ago,</b>
      <br>
      <b>its legend never did.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Prior to its discovery by Europeans, Alcatraz was viewed as
a barren</b>
      <br>
      <b>white rock---white because it was covered with pelican
droppings--thus</b>
      <br>
      <b>receiving the name of La Isla de los Alcatraces or "The Island
of
the</b>
      <br>
      <b>Pelicans," by the Spanish. However, it wasn't until the 1850s,
that
the</b>
      <br>
      <b>importance of this tiny island as a defensive position was
realized.</b>
      <br>
      <b>Finally, the military decided to build a fortress in case an
unfriendly</b>
      <br>
      <b>ship might decide to enter the Golden Gate. The Army Corps of
Engineers</b>
      <br>
      <b>began to construct an impenetrable and imposing structure in
1854.
The</b>
      <br>
      <b>original construction estimates of $300,000 did not take into
account</b>
      <br>
      <b>the wind, rain, fog, strong ocean currents, lack of water,
lack
of</b>
      <br>
      <b>vegetation, and the fact that there was only one possible spot
to
land</b>
      <br>
      <b>equipment and supplies.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Construction began with the erection of a temporary wharf
for supplies.</b>
      <br>
      <b>This was followed by wooden shops, storehouses, barracks and
offices.</b>
      <br>
      <b>Those who couldn't make it in the gold fields, became
reluctant
laborers</b>
      <br>
      <b>on Alcatraz. The labor force carved out roadways and other
features
as</b>
      <br>
      <b>the fortress slowly took shape. It was only a matter of time
before</b>
      <br>
      <b>Alcatraz began taking human life. During 1857, while a crew was</b>
      <br>
      <b>excavating along the roadway between the wharf and the
guard-house,
a</b>
      <br>
      <b>7,000 cubic-yard rock landslide buried a team of laborers:
Daniel</b>
      <br>
      <b>Pewter, age 50, of Ireland and Jacob Unger, 25, of Germany
were
the</b>
      <br>
      <b>first known deaths on Alcatraz. On a cold December day in
1859,
the</b>
      <br>
      <b>Third Artillery arrived on Alcatraz with a group of eleven
anonymous</b>
      <br>
      <b>soldiers of Company H---the first prisoners to be incarcerated
in
irons</b>
      <br>
      <b>in the basement cellroom of the guardhouse for crimes not
recorded
in</b>
      <br>
      <b>the army files. Alcatraz was now a fully operational fortress
and</b>
      <br>
      <b>prison. By Aug. 27, 1861, Alcatraz was designated as the
official</b>
      <br>
      <b>military prison for the entire Department of the Pacific.
Living</b>
      <br>
      <b>conditions were grim. Men slept side-by-side, head-to-toe,
lying
on the</b>
      <br>
      <b>stone floors. There was no running water or heat in the
cells,&nbsp;
sanitary</b>
      <br>
      <b>facilities were almost non-existent, and disease was rampant.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>After&nbsp; the Civil War, confederate sympathizers caught
celebrating
the</b>
      <br>
      <b>death of President Lincoln were sent to Alcatraz.&nbsp; In
1868,
the Army</b>
      <br>
      <b>designated Alcatraz Island as a prison for military convicts
and</b>
      <br>
      <b>malcontents of society. By the late 1800s-early 1900s, Indian
chiefs
and</b>
      <br>
      <b>tribal leaders of Arizona and Alaska were incarcerated along
with
some</b>
      <br>
      <b>of the worst thieves, deserters, rapists, and repeated
escapees
from the</b>
      <br>
      <b>Army. Alcatraz again became a disciplinary barracks for U.S.
Army</b>
      <br>
      <b>military incorrigibles, as well as a health resort when
soldiers</b>
      <br>
      <b>returning from the Spanish American war convalesced there.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>On the morning of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake,
Alcatraz shook,
but</b>
      <br>
      <b>sustained little damage. That same year, four prisoners tried
to
paddle</b>
      <br>
      <b>to the mainland on a butter vat, only to have strong currents
bring
them</b>
      <br>
      <b>back. Driftwood was used during escape attempts in 1912, 1916,
1927
and</b>
      <br>
      <b>a ladder was used during a escape attempt in 1929. All of the
men
were</b>
      <br>
      <b>captured or surrendered, victims of the cruel currents, and
cold
water.</b>
      <br>
      <b>In 1911, Alcatraz was officially named the United States
Disciplinary</b>
      <br>
      <b>Barracks---an official Army Prison which included both U.S.
Army</b>
      <br>
      <b>prisoners as well as German seamen who became prisoners of war.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>The social upheaval of the 1920's and 30s, and rampant
crime sweeping</b>
      <br>
      <b>American provided Alcatraz with new life. Daring escapes,
gang-related</b>
      <br>
      <b>murders and mass rioting were a menace to an orderly prison.
Attorney</b>
      <br>
      <b>General Homer Cummings supported J. Edgar Hoover in creating a
facility</b>
      <br>
      <b>which would instill fear in would-be criminals by creating a
place
where</b>
      <br>
      <b>prisoners could be safely controlled and could not escape. In
1933,
the</b>
      <br>
      <b>prison facility was formally turned over to the Federal Bureau
of</b>
      <br>
      <b>Prisons. During 1934, Alcatraz became a an escape-proof,
maximum</b>
      <br>
      <b>security prison, where only the most hardened convicts were
brought.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>The first residents of newly created Alcatraz, received
numbers 1-
32,</b>
      <br>
      <b>with Frank Bolt having the distinction of being Federal
Prisoner
#l</b>
      <br>
      <b>while serving a five-year sentence for sodomy. He was followed
by</b>
      <br>
      <b>Charles Copp (Robbery and Attempted Assault), Leon Gregory
(Robbery,</b>
      <br>
      <b>Assault, and AWOL), Joseph Harrison (sodomy), Forrest Henry

      <br>
      <b>Albert Hoke (Robbery), Alan Hood (Sodomy), and Frederick Holme
(Sodomy</b>
      <br>
      <b>and False Enlistment) to round out the first ten inmates. AL
Capone
was</b>
      <br>
      <b>the first celebrity on the first train to Alcatraz, arriving
in
August</b>
      <br>
      <b>1934---He was given the number 85.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Guards armed with machine guns, ensured that
there were
no&nbsp; escapes.</b>
      <br>
      <b>Many convicts found Alcatraz the end of their career in crime,
as
well</b>
      <br>
      <b>as the end of their lives. For&nbsp; twenty- nine years, the
fog-enshrouded</b>
      <br>
      <b>island, with its damp, cold winds, and isolation made Alcatraz
one
of</b>
      <br>
      <b>America's safest prisons. The shell of steel and reinforced
concrete</b>
      <br>
      <b>confined ruthless men to a life of deprivation, rules, and
routines
that</b>
      <br>
      <b>proved almost intolerable. When one adds the fact that the
convicts</b>
      <br>
      <b>could hear party boats pass by, and see the San Francisco city
lights,</b>
      <br>
      <b>it is little wonder&nbsp; that some preferred death to this
kind
of</b>
      <br>
      <b>isolation. Failure to acquiesce to prison rules resulted in
confinement</b>
      <br>
      <b>in "D" Block, the treatment unit. Here, men could leave their
four-</b>
      <br>
      <b>by-eight-foot cells only once in seven days for a brief
ten-minute</b>
      <br>
      <b>shower. Life was hard on Alcatraz, just the way Warden Johnston</b>
      <br>
      <b>envisioned it. His motto was, "Take each day of your sentence,
one
day</b>
      <br>
      <b>at a time. Don't think how far you have to go, but how far
you've
come."</b>
      <br>
      <b>For many prisoners, Alcatraz became synonymous with hell.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>There were a number of escape attempts from Alcatraz, but
the bloodiest</b>
      <br>
      <b>occurred on May 2, 1946 involving, Bernard Coy,&nbsp; Joseph
Cretzer,&nbsp;
Sam</b>
      <br>
      <b>Shockley, Clarence Carnes, Marvin Hubbard, and Miran Thompson.
It
cost</b>
      <br>
      <b>the lives of three inmates and two guards, with 17 guards and
one</b>
      <br>
      <b>prisoner wounded. The trial afterward, resulted in the
execution
of two</b>
      <br>
      <b>more convicts who took part in the aborted escape.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Attorney General Robert Kennedy officially closed the doors
of Alcatraz</b>
      <br>
      <b>on March 21 , 1963.&nbsp; From 1963 until 1969, the prison was
unoccupied.</b>
      <br>
      <b>Today it is maintained by the Golden Gate National Recreation
Area

      <br>
      <b>almost a million visitors per year pay to see "The Rock". To

      <p><b>The reputation of Alcatraz, like the solid ground it was
built on,</b>
      <br>
      <b>represents a lasting reminder, that no man is above the law,
and
for</b>
      <br>
      <b>some, it is an eternal payback for their crimes against
humanity---kind</b>
      <br>
      <b>of an paranormal prison. Here are some of the stories.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>&nbsp;During a Sightings visit in 1992, several of the Park
Service
staff</b>
      <br>
      <b>confirmed the haunted history of Alcatraz. Many rangers had
experienced</b>
      <br>
      <b>unexplainable crashing sounds, cell doors mysteriously closing,</b>
      <br>
      <b>unearthly screams, and intense feelings of being watched.
Sightings</b>
      <br>
      <b>called on psychic investigator Peter James to walk through
portions
of</b>
      <br>
      <b>the abandoned prison to get his impressions. James began to
pick
up on</b>
      <br>
      <b>the voices of the tortured souls driven mad since it's
inception
as a</b>
      <br>
      <b>prison. He also sensed unusual vibrations of abuse,
mistreatment,
fear,</b>
      <br>
      <b>and pain. His overall impression of Alcatraz was, that it had
an
energy</b>
      <br>
      <b>like no other he had ever experienced---a persistent and
overwhelming</b>
      <br>
      <b>intensity that engulfed the island.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>&nbsp;Some of&nbsp; the more haunted locations on Alcatraz
appear
to be the</b>
      <br>
      <b>Warden's House, the hospital, the laundry room, and Cell Block
C
utility</b>
      <br>
      <b>door where convicts Coy, Cretzer and Hubbard died during their
escape</b>
      <br>
      <b>attempt in 1946. The most haunted area on Alcatraz, is the "D"
cell</b>
      <br>
      <b>block, or solitary, as it was often called. To most who go
there,
a</b>
      <br>
      <b>feeling of sudden intensity pervades the cells and corridor.
Some</b>
      <br>
      <b>rangers refuse to go there alone. It is intensely cold in
certain
cells,</b>
      <br>
      <b>far colder than normal---especially cell 14-D. This cell is
oftentimes</b>
      <br>
      <b>so cold, that wearing a jacket barely helps---even though the</b>
      <br>
      <b>surrounding area is twenty degrees warmer. It is no wonder the
area
was</b>
      <br>
      <b>called "The Hole."</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>When authors, Richard Winer and Nancy Osborn visited
Alcatraz, they</b>
      <br>
      <b>ventured down to solitary with a park ranger.&nbsp; As Osborn
entered
cell</b>
      <br>
      <b>14-D, she immediately felt strong vibrations coming from
within.
Winer</b>
      <br>
      <b>and the ranger&nbsp; followed Osborn, and within
seconds,&nbsp;
each of them</b>
      <br>
      <b>experienced an intense tingling sensation in their hands and
arms---they</b>
      <br>
      <b>were&nbsp; convinced that something or someone was in there
with
them. The</b>
      <br>
      <b>far corner of the cell where they were standing, and feeling
the
intense</b>
      <br>
      <b>energy, was the exact spot where the naked, shivering
prisoners
would</b>
      <br>
      <b>huddle, night after night, in the unforgiving darkness. Osborn
said
that</b>
      <br>
      <b>she had never felt so much energy before in one spot.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Renowned ghosthunter Richard Senate, and a psychic spent
the night
on</b>
      <br>
      <b>Alcatraz as part of a KGO radio promotion. They chose Al
Capone's
cell</b>
      <br>
      <b>as a place of temporary refuge. According to Senate, emotions
seemed
to</b>
      <br>
      <b>drip from every corner of Alcatraz as the long night
progressed.
He and</b>
      <br>
      <b>the psychic visited the spots where rangers said they heard
marching</b>
      <br>
      <b>footsteps, and clanking metal; however, nothing happened.
Finally,</b>
      <br>
      <b>Senate&nbsp; locked himself in&nbsp; cell 12-D, where an evil
and
persistent ghost</b>
      <br>
      <b>is rumored to dwell. As the thick, steel door was closed,
Senate</b>
      <br>
      <b>immediately felt icy fingers on his neck, and his hair stood
on
end. He</b>
      <br>
      <b>knew he was not alone. Additionally, the psychic picked up on
the</b>
      <br>
      <b>twisted and dismembered bodies of uniformed men. Both left the
island</b>
      <br>
      <b>convinced that Alcatraz had its own special energy.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>According to Antoinette May, much of the paranormal
activity on Alcatraz</b>
      <br>
      <b>occurs around areas associated with the penitentiary's worst
tragedies.</b>
      <br>
      <b>One of them is the Block C utility corridor, Cell Blocks A and
B,
with</b>
      <br>
      <b>the eeriest area centering around cell 14-D---where it is
always
cold.</b>
      <br>
      <b>According to May, gifted psychic Sylvia Brown accompanied by a
CBS
news</b>
      <br>
      <b>team, investigated parts of Alcatraz. As Brown toured the
prison</b>
      <br>
      <b>hospital she picked up cards and notes tacked up on a wall,
and
the</b>
      <br>
      <b>letter "S." A ranger confirmed that the "S" probably stood for
Robert</b>
      <br>
      <b>Stroud who spent ten-and-a-half years in the hospital, in the
very
room</b>
      <br>
      <b>they were standing. He also had hundreds of notes and cards
tacked
up</b>
      <br>
      <b>all around him. Brown sensed strong energy in what used to be
the</b>
      <br>
      <b>therapy room, and the prison laundry room, where at least one
prisoner</b>
      <br>
      <b>was murdered.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Co-author, Michael Kouri, visited Alcatraz Island in July
of 1984
with</b>
      <br>
      <b>his uncle. After several preliminary psychic impressions,
Kouri
reached</b>
      <br>
      <b>cell 14-D, and entered. He first felt a "tingling sensation",
which</b>
      <br>
      <b>began at his fingertips; then, a very intense feeling of cold
engulfed</b>
      <br>
      <b>him. In a slight trance, he began to communicate with the
spirit
of a</b>
      <br>
      <b>man of small stature; who had his head shaved and was left in
"The</b>
      <br>
      <b>Hole." The spirit, in obvious pain, "told" a horrifying tale
of
being</b>
      <br>
      <b>beaten, his leg broken by&nbsp; guards, and left in solitary
confinement---he</b>
      <br>
      <b>had squealed on a fellow inmate---the year was 1939. Kouri
then
tried to</b>
      <br>
      <b>lead the poor soul to the light. [Note: Kouri's other unique
experience</b>
      <br>
      <b>with a visitor, is truly remarkable, as well as an interview
with
the</b>
      <br>
      <b>wife of an ex-warden---but you'll have wait until&nbsp; the
book
comes out].</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>A former guard related his stories about Cell Block D
(particularly</b>
      <br>
      <b>cells 12 and 14), and the frightening remnant energy lingering
in
the</b>
      <br>
      <b>subterranean portion of the prison. During his stint during the</b>
      <br>
      <b>mid-1940,&nbsp; convicts were often confined in one of the 14
cells
in "D"</b>
      <br>
      <b>Block (cells 9-14 were called "The Hole," because they
contained
no</b>
      <br>
      <b>windows, and only one light which could be turned off by the
guards.
The</b>
      <br>
      <b>darkness made it seem like a hole in the ground---hence the
name.
On one</b>
      <br>
      <b>occasion, an inmate was locked in "The Hole". Within seconds,
the
inmate</b>
      <br>
      <b>began screaming that someone with glowing eyes was in there
with
him.</b>
      <br>
      <b>Tales of a ghostly presence wandering the darkened corridors
in
clothing</b>
      <br>
      <b>from the late 1800,s were a&nbsp; continual source of
practical
joking among</b>
      <br>
      <b>the guards, so the convict's pleas of being "attacked," were
ignored.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>The man's screaming continued well into the night, until
there was</b>
      <br>
      <b>silence. The following day, the guards inspected the
cell---the
convict</b>
      <br>
      <b>was dead, a horrible expression etched on his face, and
noticeable
hand</b>
      <br>
      <b>marks around his throat. The autopsy revealed that the
strangulation
was</b>
      <br>
      <b>not self-inflicted. Some say he was strangled by a guard who
had
enough</b>
      <br>
      <b>of the man's screaming---although no guard ever admitted it,
even
to the</b>
      <br>
      <b>other guards. Others believed it was the restless, evil spirit
of
a</b>
      <br>
      <b>former inmate who exacted his vengeance on yet another
helpless
soul. To</b>
      <br>
      <b>add to the mystery, the day after the tragedy, several guards,</b>
      <br>
      <b>performing a routine lineup of the convicts, counted one too
many</b>
      <br>
      <b>people. At the end of the line, the guards witnessed an extra</b>
      <br>
      <b>body---that of the recently deceased convict. As everyone
looked
on in</b>
      <br>
      <b>stunned silence, the figure of the ghostly convict vanished
into
thin</b>
      <br>
      <b>air!</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>A number of guards from 1946 through 1963, experienced
something
out of</b>
      <br>
      <b>the ordinary at one time or another. From the outer rim on the
grounds</b>
      <br>
      <b>to the deepest caverns, there was constant talk of people
sobbing
and</b>
      <br>
      <b>moaning,&nbsp; horrible smells, cold spots, and seeing the
"thing"
with</b>
      <br>
      <b>glowing eyes. Even groups of phantom prisoners and soldiers
have</b>
      <br>
      <b>appeared in front of startled guards, guests, and&nbsp; the
families
who</b>
      <br>
      <b>lived on the island.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>&nbsp;Sometimes the old lighthouse (long since
demolished)&nbsp;
appeared out of a</b>
      <br>
      <b>dense fog, accompanied by a ghostly whistling sound, and a
great</b>
      <br>
      <b>flashing light which passed slowly around the entire island,
just
as if</b>
      <br>
      <b>the Lighthouse was still active. The spectacle would&nbsp;
then
vanish before</b>
      <br>
      <b>the startled eyes of guards and visitors. Phantom cannon
shots,
gun</b>
      <br>
      <b>shots, and screams oftentimes sent seasoned guards falling
flat
on their</b>
      <br>
      <b>stomachs thinking that prisoners had escaped and obtained
weapons.
Each</b>
      <br>
      <b>time, there was no explanation. A deserted laundry room would
sometimes</b>
      <br>
      <b>emanate a strong scent of smoke, as if something was on fire.
The</b>
      <br>
      <b>sensation of the choking smoke would drive guards out of the
room,
only</b>
      <br>
      <b>to return a few minutes later, the area now completely smoke
free---the</b>
      <br>
      <b>phantom smoke occurred many times over the years.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Even Warden Johnston, who didn't believe in ghosts,
encountered the</b>
      <br>
      <b>unmistakable sounds of woman sobbing, as if coming from inside
the
walls</b>
      <br>
      <b>of the dungeon while he accompanied a number of guests on a
tour
of the</b>
      <br>
      <b>facility. As if that weren't enough, an icy, cold gust of wind
blew</b>
      <br>
      <b>through the group, chilling them to the bone, just as the
sobbing</b>
      <br>
      <b>stopped.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>The now burned-out shell of the Warden's House, has also
been a focal</b>
      <br>
      <b>point for sightings since the 1940s. During a Christmas Party,
several</b>
      <br>
      <b>guards witnessed the chilling apparition of a man wearing a
gray
suit,</b>
      <br>
      <b>brimmed cap, and mutton chop side burns. When the men saw the</b>
      <br>
      <b>apparition, the room turned deathly cold, the fire in the Ben
Franklin</b>
      <br>
      <b>stove was extinguished, and after less than a minute, the man
vanished.</b><b></b>
