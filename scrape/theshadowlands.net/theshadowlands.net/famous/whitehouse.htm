      <p><b>&nbsp;It is not well known that Abraham Lincoln was very
interested
in&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>parapsychology and seances in his later years. Another person
in
the White&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>House was fond of seances as well, Eleanor Roosevelt. She has
reported
to&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>have become friends with Abraham Lincoln through her many
seances
over the&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>years.</b>
      <br>
      <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Harry Truman once wrote about the
maids
in the White House were very&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>disturbed at seeing what they thought was Lincoln's ghost. On
one
occasion&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>Truman was trying to work, but was repeatedly disturbed by
constant
knocking&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>at his office door. He commented to a friend "I think it must
have
been&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>Lincoln's ghost walking down the hall."</b>
      <br>
      <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When a reporter asked Roslyn Carter
about
the Lincoln ghost, she refused&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>to comment. But, when Jacqueline Kennedy was asked she stated
she
felt&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>Lincoln's presence many times, and "took great comfort in it".</b>
      <br>
      <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lincoln's son Willie has also
been
seen in the Grant and Taft&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>administrations. He died in the White House when Lincoln was
President.</b>
      <br>
      <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Many speculate that Lincoln's
spirit
stays on in the White House&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>because of the trauma he indured while in office. Others feel
Lincoln
appears&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>in times of crisis in America.</b><b></b>
