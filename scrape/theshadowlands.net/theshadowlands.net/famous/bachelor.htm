      <p><b>This small abandoned, unkempt cemetery in the southern
suburb of
Chicago is one of the most haunted cemeteries in the United
States.&nbsp;
Many different types of happenings have been reported here since the
land
was set aside as a cemetery.&nbsp; The name came to be because of the
large
number of single men living around the area in the past.&nbsp; No one
has
been buried here since the 1960&#8217;s, and has been neglected and abused
much.&nbsp;
The site is popular for various groups that are involved in voodoo
practices
and Satanism, which I&#8217;m sure does not help in the peace of the souls
still
wandering around.&nbsp; Some of the ghosts witnessed here include a
farmer
with his horse pulling a plow, this seems to come from a farmer who was
drowned in nearby water, when his horse bolted into the water with the
plow and farmer behind.&nbsp; A ghostly farmhouse that appears with a
fence
and light swinging from the front porch, anyone trying to approach it,
finds that it vanishes from sight.&nbsp; One of the most prominent
ghosts
here is the White Lady, the Madonna of Bachelor&#8217;s Grove. She appears
during
full moons, and is thought to be women who is buried here next to her
young
son.&nbsp; One odd ghost seen here is a two-headed man; no one seems to
claim why this person appears here.&nbsp; During the 1920s this spot
was
a favorite spot for the dumping of murder victims from mobsters around
the Chicago area.&nbsp; Phantom cars have also been seen around this
area
on the roads.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;
