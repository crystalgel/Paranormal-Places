      <p><b><font color="#ffffff">The Burlington County Prison Museum
is located
in Mt Holly, NJ.&nbsp;&nbsp; The prison was built in 1811 and was</font></b>
      <b><font color="#ffffff">designed by the famous architect Robert
Mills
(the designer of the Washington Monument).&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a
large&nbsp;</font></b>&nbsp; <b><font color="#ffffff">rectangle
building made of stone and
iron
that looks more like a castle from the outside.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was
used&nbsp;</font></b> <b><font color="#ffffff">continuously as a jail
until 1966.&nbsp; Since
then local legends spoke of the ghosts that inhabited the
building.&nbsp;&nbsp;
One&nbsp;</font></b> <b><font color="#ffffff">in particular was the
ghost of Joseph
Clough,
a convicted murderer who killed his mistress with a leg from a&nbsp;</font></b>&nbsp;
      <b><font color="#ffffff">table.&nbsp;&nbsp; He was held in the
death
row cell which consisted of an eye hook in the floor which he was
always&nbsp;</font></b>&nbsp; <b><font color="#ffffff">chained and a
extremely small
window.&nbsp;&nbsp;
He was eventually hanged in the the 1850's and other guards and&nbsp;</font></b>&nbsp;
      <b><font color="#ffffff">prisoners report hearing his moans and
chains
rattling from that cell.&nbsp;&nbsp; The guards and inmates also
reported&nbsp;</font></b>&nbsp; <b><font color="#ffffff">seeing
someone in the empty cell as well
as
objects levitating in the cell.&nbsp;</font></b>&nbsp; </p>
      <p><b><font color="#ffffff">In 1999 the county began a
restoration project
transforming the run down building into a museum and returning it&nbsp;</font></b>
      <b><font color="#ffffff">to it's original condition.&nbsp; As the
work
progressed the construction working began reporting strange events
such&nbsp;</font></b>&nbsp; <b><font color="#ffffff">as loud noises,
voices and screams
coming
from various areas of the building.&nbsp; They also reported having
their&nbsp;</font></b>&nbsp; <b><font color="#ffffff">tools disappear
when they turn thir
backs
only to find the missing items in another room or on another floor
later&nbsp;</font></b>&nbsp; <b><font color="#ffffff">on in the
day.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Eventually
some workers were leaving early so they would not be the last ones in
the
building.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></b>&nbsp; <b><font
 color="#ffffff">The county officials decided to contact
a
local research ghost research group, South Jersey Ghost Research,
to&nbsp;</font></b>&nbsp; <b><font color="#ffffff">see what they could
verify the claims of
the
workers and to put their minds at ease.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was on each SJGR
team</font></b> <b><font color="#ffffff">that gone out to the museum
and
witnessed
some of supernatural events first hand.&nbsp;&nbsp; On each
investigation
I set&nbsp;</font></b>&nbsp; <b><font color="#ffffff">up a motion
detector in the death row
cell.&nbsp;&nbsp;
During each trip the motion detector was set off by an unseen
force.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></b>&nbsp; <b><font color="#ffffff">We
were able to capture orbs on video
and
film simultaneously with the motion detectors alarm going
off.&nbsp;&nbsp;
On&nbsp;</font></b> <b><font color="#ffffff">the 2nd visit, I also
obtained an EVP
seconds
after the motion detector went off which was a man's voice saying&nbsp;</font></b>&nbsp;
      <b><font color="#ffffff">'go out here'.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We did
experience
objects moving as well, as did 3 reporters from the New York Times that
were&nbsp;</font></b> <b><font color="#ffffff">there with
us.&nbsp;&nbsp;
A stretcher that was located in the cell next to the death row cell
relocated
itself and it was actually&nbsp;</font></b> <b><font color="#ffffff">the
reporters who noticed it first.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other members of the
SJGR observed a apparition in one part of the building&nbsp;</font></b>
      <b><font color="#ffffff">and found a single barefoot print on a
dust covered
floor of what was once the prison showers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The teams
also&nbsp;</font></b> <b><font color="#ffffff">obtained numerous
photos,
video clips and EMF readings.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can view some of the
photos
and other&nbsp;</font></b> <b><font color="#ffffff">evidence on the
SJGR
website:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.hanutedhelp.org">http://www.hanutedhelp.org.&nbsp;</a></font></b>
      </p>
      <p><b><font color="#ffffff">SJGR has investigated the museum many
times since they were first called out to investigate the
building.&nbsp;&nbsp; On our 10th trip there, I obtained two apparition
photos using a new camera rig I was testing.<br>
