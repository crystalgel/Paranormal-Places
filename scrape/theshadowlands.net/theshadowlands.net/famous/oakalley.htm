      <p><b>By Stacey Graham (WyntersMoon@theshadowlands.net)</b><b></b>

      <p><b>What better place to film a movie about creatures that walk
the night
than Oak Alley Plantation in Vacherie, Louisiana?&nbsp; Seen in
numerous
films including, "Interview with a Vampire," the plantation has it's
own
way of making visitors feel welcome.&nbsp; A canopy of tall oaks shield
visitors from sunlight as it frames the main house, its soft pink walls
beckon to you relax under the formidable veranda.&nbsp; Is it no wonder
that the original family was loathe to leave it?</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>The wealthy Creole family, the Romans, have left an
indelible mark
on the mansion.&nbsp; A lady in black strolls the widow's walk or
beneath
the shade of the oaks.&nbsp; Could she be the spirit of Louise
Roman?&nbsp;
As a young woman, she ran to escape the amorous advances of a drunken
suitor
and fell, slicing open her leg on the iron hoop frame.&nbsp; Gangrene
set
in and to save her life, doctors amputated the leg beneath the
knee.&nbsp;
Was the drama of that night carved into life of the oaks?&nbsp; Does
she
still walk beneath the trees of her youth?&nbsp; Louise, in her late
twenties,
founded a Carmelite Convent in New Orleans and died peacefully many
years
later, so perhaps not&#8230;</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Employees at the plantation are regularly visited by the
supernatural.&nbsp;
Lights turn off and on during tours, touches as they walk by certain
rooms,
the smell of lavender wafts through the room of the original lady of
the
house along with the presence of a shadow just out of the corner of the
eye.&nbsp; Phantom carriages have been heard riding up a gravel road,
the
clip-clop of hooves resounding in the stillness that sometimes
accompanies
the sound.&nbsp; A child weeps, it's plaintive misery being carried
through
time and echoes in the empty mansion.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Recently, a candlestick flew across a room while a tour was
being
conducted.&nbsp; Visions of a violent and deadly struggle accompanied
one
woman while on tour, she watched as two men of the house wrestled with
a Confederate soldier.&nbsp; The soldier is pushed from a second floor
balcony, his body was then dragged to the river and rolled in.&nbsp;
Later,
a houseguest reported intense back pain while on the veranda.&nbsp; As
he moved away, the pain lessened but returned if he ventured back to
the
spot.&nbsp; He was so amazed by the experience that he shared it with
his
hostess who then revealed that that was the area in which the scuffle
in
the vision had taken place.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Clocks hold a time all their own at Oak Valley.&nbsp; In an
old southern
custom, the clocks are stopped at the exact moment of the last owner's
death (in this case, 7:30am).&nbsp; The clocks were not touched again
since.&nbsp;
Recently, several guides have found that many of the clocks were set to
different hours around the house.&nbsp; Did they reflect the death of
other
family members or do they follow the mysterious ticking of a clock only
heard but never seen in the mansion?</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Perhaps the most intriguing question at Oak Alley pertains
to a photograph
taken by Mr. Bernard of Fort Worth, TX.&nbsp; While touring the rooms,
he snapped a picture in the master bedroom.&nbsp; When the film was
developed,
the shade of a young woman with waist-length chestnut colored hair
appeared
to be gazing out the French doors towards to the alley.&nbsp; When
sending
the photograph back to Oak Alley for their opinion, at first glance
they
thought it was a dressmaker's mannequin that is displayed in the
room.&nbsp;
Of course, however, the mannequin is headless so you may draw your own
conclusions</b>
