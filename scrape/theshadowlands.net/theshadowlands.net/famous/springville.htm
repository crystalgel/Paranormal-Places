      <br>
      <b>California</b></center>
      <p><b>The Springville Inn caters to four very special and unique
guests.
They are</b>
      <br>
      <b>residents who have watched over the Inn for almost 100 years.
They
are not</b>
      <br>
      <b>demanding or critical, they never offer their opinion on how
to
run a</b>
      <br>
      <b>country inn, they are not malevolent, they do not disturb the
quiet
of night</b>
      <br>
      <b>and their enjoyment is not derived from scaring people.&nbsp;
But,
there is a</b>
      <br>
      <b>definite presence about them. These bodiless, ethereal and
lustrous</b>
      <br>
      <b>creatures are The Ghosts of The Springville Inn.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>For nearly 100 years, The Springville Inn has been a
treasured part
of local</b>
      <br>
      <b>history and has stood the test of&nbsp; time as she has
lovingly
watched over</b>
      <br>
      <b>Springville as one of the old guards to the High Sierra -
newly
proclaimed a</b>
      <br>
      <b>National Monument by Presidential order.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Our ghosts predominately inhabit the original 1911 main
building
formerly</b>
      <br>
      <b>known as the Wilkinson Hotel. They have never been seen or
their
presence</b>
      <br>
      <b>felt in the hotel which was added on in 1972. Nor, have there
been
any</b>
      <br>
      <b>experiences with them in the Grill Room which was added on to
the
main</b>
      <br>
      <b>building in 1979. They exist as they have throughout the</b>
      <br>
      <b>years in the main building, known as the Wilkinson Hotel in
its
heyday.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Local historian, Jeff Edwards, has told us that there was
no coroner
or</b>
      <br>
      <b>morgue in Springville, so upon ones untimely demise, their
bodies
were</b>
      <br>
      <b>placed in the upstairs rooms of the hotel on ice to await
transport
by</b>
      <br>
      <b>stagecoach or train to Porterville.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>We can only speculate as to the true identity of our four
ghosts
as</b>
      <br>
      <b>historical records are vague and incomplete. We do not know
their
given</b>
      <br>
      <b>names but we refer to them lovingly as the Young Man who looks</b>
      <br>
      <b>to be a handsome logger in his twenties who was likely working
in
one of the</b>
      <br>
      <b>numerous mills of Mountain Home. The Little Girl who looks to</b>
      <br>
      <b>be near eight years of age is appropriately clothed in a
turn-of-the-century</b>
      <br>
      <b>dress. The Woman, beautiful and elegant with flowing blonde</b>
      <br>
      <b>hair in a long dress is seen floating on the balcony
surrounding
the</b>
      <br>
      <b>Penthouse or wandering the second floor hallways in the main
building.
The</b>
      <br>
      <b>Old Man, who seems to keep to himself in the kitchen with a
watchful</b>
      <br>
      <b>eye has the most frequent contact with past and present
employees.
He</b>
      <br>
      <b>generally only appears in the main kitchen of the Inn or the
upstairs</b>
      <br>
      <b>service kitchen. He is usually seen staring up or down into
the
dumbwaiter</b>
      <br>
      <b>joining the two kitchens. He is not shy as he frequently makes
himself
seen</b>
      <br>
      <b>by our chefs and kitchen staff.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>According to sightings throughout the past and present, the
Young
Man moves</b>
      <br>
      <b>fluidly with purpose around the bar and up what was the
original
grand</b>
      <br>
      <b>staircase which brought guests from the lobby straight
upstairs
as you</b>
      <br>
      <b>entered the building. He is known to be a flirt with a habit of</b>
      <br>
      <b>brushing up against women to make his presence known. He is
said
to be a</b>
      <br>
      <b>logger who was shot outside the Inn, in the streets of
Springville.</b>
      <br>
      <b>According to legend, guests carried him into the Hotel where
he
bled to</b>
      <br>
      <b>death. Occasionally he has been seen walking hand-in hand with
the</b>
      <br>
      <b>Little Girl, but not recently or by any current staff members.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Numerous employees and guests of the Inn have experienced
the ghosts
- some</b>
      <br>
      <b>of whom appreciate their wanderings and some whom would rather
not
have an</b>
      <br>
      <b>encounter with them. A past employee washing dishes in the
kitchen
quit</b>
      <br>
      <b>after witnessing the Little Girl watching her in the</b>
      <br>
      <b>mirror which hung in the dishwashing area. The owners quickly
removed
the</b>
      <br>
      <b>mirror. The Little Girl has not been seen since.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Do you believe in Ghosts? Spend some time at the Inn and
you just
might meet</b>
      <br>
      <b>one of our eternal guests...</b>
