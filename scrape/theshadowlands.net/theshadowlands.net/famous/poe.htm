      <b></b></p>
      <p><b>People often take it for granted that Edgar Allen Poe's
former houses</b>
      <br>
      <b>could be haunted. Though his ghost has been spotted other
places,
his old home</b>
      <br>
      <b>on 203 N. Amity Street in Baltimore is haunted by someone else.</b>
      <br>
      <b>The building is a two and a half story brick row house. It is
very
small</b>
      <br>
      <b>and narrow. The attic room that Poe lived in is so tiny that
adults
often</b>
      <br>
      <b>have trouble standing up in it. The house was built in 1830,
and
Poe's</b>
      <br>
      <b>aunt Maria Clemm rented it in 1832. Poe himself lived there
from
that year</b>
      <br>
      <b>until 1835, along with her, his grandmother, and two cousins.
(One
of these</b>
      <br>
      <b>cousins was Virginia Clemm, whom he later married.)</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>In 1939 the house was almost demolished during a "slum
clearance"
program.</b>
      <br>
      <b>It was taken over by the Edgar Allen Poe society of Baltimore
in
1941. The</b>
      <br>
      <b>house is open to the public and operated by Jeff Jerome, who
has
been the</b>
      <br>
      <b>curator since 1977. One of the interesting things that can be
seen
there</b>
      <br>
      <b>is a portrait of Poe's wife painted from her corpse.</b>
      <br>
      <b>Doors and windows in the Poe house often open and close by
themselves.
In</b>
      <br>
      <b>1968 a local resident called the police after seeing a light
moving
around</b>
      <br>
      <b>the closed building late at night. When the police arrived
they
saw a</b>
      <br>
      <b>candle-like light move from the first floor, through the
second,
and up to</b>
      <br>
      <b>the attic. When they went into the house no one was there.</b>
      <br>
      <b>Curator Jeff Jerome has stated to several sources that the
identity
of the</b>
      <br>
      <b>spirits has not been determined. Most of the activity has
taken
place in</b>
      <br>
      <b>the bedroom that was once Poe's grandmother's. (Jerome has
also
cautioned that</b>
      <br>
      <b>many people have lived there besides Poe. Have lived there.
After
all, it</b>
      <br>
      <b>was a rental house in a slum area.) Elizabeth Poe did die in
the
house in</b>
      <br>
      <b>1835. In her room many people have been tapped on the
shoulder.
In 1980</b>
      <br>
      <b>people gathered for a radio station publicity stunt heard
voices
and other</b>
      <br>
      <b>noises.&nbsp; Several psychics have reported seeing visions of
an
old woman</b>
      <br>
      <b>dressed in clothing of the 1830s. She has grey hair and is
heavy
set.</b>
      <br>
      <b>Psychics have also reported sensations in Virginia's room and
Poe's
attic.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>During the 1940s the building became surrounded by Poe
homes, the
city's</b>
      <br>
      <b>first housing project. Since then, the neighborhood residents
have
had</b>
      <br>
      <b>their own stories about the Poe museum. Tales about his spirit
are
used to</b>
      <br>
      <b>frighten children. A November 1985 New York Times article
reported
that</b>
      <br>
      <b>street gangs were afraid of the house and therefore left it
alone.
Several</b>
      <br>
      <b>residents have admitted to being scared of the place.</b>
      <br>
      <b>A recent article that appeared in the Baltimore Sun (September
18,
1999)</b>
      <br>
      <b>reported on how the local residents felt about the Poe house.
Some
people</b>
      <br>
      <b>believe that Poe's ghost terrorizes the neighborhood, running
across</b>
      <br>
      <b>rooftops and grabbing children to torture. A local man
reported
that in</b>
      <br>
      <b>August 1999 he looked the window to see a shadowy spirit
sitting
at a</b>
      <br>
      <b>writing desk. (Others have reported this, though Poe actually
did
his</b>
      <br>
      <b>writing in the attic.)</b>
      <br>
      <b>The Poe house is open to the public, though the hours vary
wildly
from</b>
      <br>
      <b>season to season. For more detailed information about the
house,
pictures</b>
      <br>
      <b>of it, and visiting hours the Edgar Allen Poe Society 's web
site
is an excellent resource.</b>
