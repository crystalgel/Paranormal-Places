      <p><b><font color="#ffffff">Like all castles in the British
Isles, Dean
Castle has its own ghosts. The land was given to the Boyd family by
Robert
The Bruce as a token of gratitude for the allegiance and support they
gave
at the Battle of Bannockburn and the great wars of independence. In
1350
work began on the keep, a solid defensive building and in the 1460's
the
palace was built, given its royal title due to it being the venue of
Princess
Mary's wedding to Thomas</font></b>
      <br>
      <b><font color="#ffffff">Boyd. The Boyd family were associated
with
the Dean Castle Estates for about four hundred years, up until William
Boyd the Fourth Earl of Kilmarnock.&nbsp;</font></b><b><font
 color="#ffffff"></font></b>
      </p>
      <p><b><font color="#ffffff">The castle has its own 'obligatory
ghost story'
concerning the Fourth Earl.&nbsp; A few years prior to the 45' uprising
William Boyd sat one evening alone in his study when he was 'treated'
to
the grisly sight of a head rolling along the floor which had appeared
out
of nowhere. The realization that it was his own head chilled him to the
bone.&nbsp; True to the tradition of the Boyds the Earl was present at
the battle of Culloden, as a Jacobite fighting for Scotland. After the
confusion of the battle&nbsp; he became lost while looking for his own
regiment, he was captured when he mistook the Royal Horse for those of
his own.</font></b>
      <br>
      <b><font color="#ffffff">Surrounding him they yelled for his
sword.
He was a proud man, tears rolled down his face; a tall Fusilier Officer
rode up and offered him a hat to hide his tears. The officer was his
own
son. Lord Boyd had been helped to his execution by his own kith and kin.</font></b>
      <br>
      <b><font color="#ffffff">The Earl was a calm man at his
execution,
he asked for men to catch his head in a large cloth, because he said he
could face death but not the thought of his own head rolling in the
dirt
covered in blood......Since, the Earls head has said to have been seen
on many occasions around the floor of the castle by some horrified
witness.&nbsp;</font></b><b><font color="#ffffff"></font></b>
      </p>
      <p><b><font color="#ffffff">The castle then fell into various
hands through
the centuries, the last private owner being Howard De Walden who in
1975
gave&nbsp; the castle and its contents as a gift to the people of
Kilmarnock.
In 1976 the then Kilmarnock District Council opened the building and
its
grounds as a museum.&nbsp;&nbsp; From Dean Castle leading to
Craudfurdland
Castle there is said to have once been a tunnel linking the two. This
was
supposedly why the defenders of Dean Castle were able to break a siege
by the English in 1296. There is no evidence to</font></b>
      <br>
      <b><font color="#ffffff">suggest that the tunnel ever existed,
but
the reason for it remaining so long as a local truth is a mystery.
Today,
the castle still has its extensive grounds with a nature reserve,
walled
gardens, (where it is said that witches once met on a moonlit night)
nature
trails and many other activities laid on by the rangers. It will make a
pleasant day out should</font></b>
      <br>
      <b><font color="#ffffff">you ever find yourself in Kilmarnock.
Once
again but in these pages I would like to thank Margaret, (pseudonym)
for
her most lively, enthusiastic and interesting&nbsp; tour of the castle
Margaret had worked as a tour guide for over two years and around the
castle
she has often seen the figure of an old woman, especially on or near
the
walkway, she describes</font></b>
      <br>
      <b><font color="#ffffff">her, "As an evil old biddy" dressed in a
long
black skirt reaching down to her ankles, a rough gray top, her head
always
covered in a shabby plaid shawl which reached down to</font></b>
      <br>
      <b><font color="#ffffff">her shoulders where she wraps it tightly
around
her. Tatty brown boots on her feet which look a few sizes too big.
While
taking a guided tour one day Margaret was approached by a female
tourist
and asked who the old woman was outside on the walkway. The description
she gave perfectly matched that of the woman Margaret herself has seen,
only this time neither&nbsp; she or any other of the group had been
aware
of her presence. The last actual sighting of the woman that I am aware
of took&nbsp; place in February 1995, also seen by a tourist but this
time
in the kitchen area.&nbsp;</font></b><b><font color="#ffffff"></font></b>
      </p>
      <p><b><font color="#ffffff">August 1992 saw a jazz festival held
in the
courtyard. Margaret along with other members of staff attended, but as
a social&nbsp; event and they were not on duty. The whole courtyard was
lit making the castle look quite impressive as it cast its eerie&nbsp;
shadow over the proceedings. During the evening Margaret again saw the
old woman watching the festival from the walkway.&nbsp; She beckoned
Margaret
to follow and against her better judgment she foolishly did so.
Margaret
walked up the stairs and found a door to a colleagues room open. Stood
next to the desk was the old biddy' smiling at her, she cannot remember
much about the evening after that. Margaret was told that she returned
to the festival looking deathly white and ill, she had to&nbsp; be
helped
into a car and taken to the near-by conservation offices. There she
spent
most of the time in the bathroom vomiting violently. It came out of her
mouth with such speed that it reached the ceiling, everywhere was awash
with vomit. Her friends told her that she had been whimpering like some
kind of wild animal and all the time shouting, "Get out of me," Get
away
from me,</font></b>
      <br>
      <b><font color="#ffffff">" "Leave me alone." Heather who stayed
with
her the whole time said that at one point the sickness just seemed to
ooze
out of every pore of Margaret's body, "The bathroom being awash."&nbsp;
They eventually managed to get Margaret home a little later on, Heather</font></b>
      <br>
      <b><font color="#ffffff">stayed with her all night to keep an
eye.
In the morning the doctor had to be called as Margaret began to
"hyperventilate."
The doctor could not explain the bluish black</font></b>
      <br>
      <b><font color="#ffffff">marks all over her body, "Like water
marks
on silk," nor could he explain or</font></b>
      <br>
      <b><font color="#ffffff">figure out what exactly was ailing
Margaret.
On another occasion just after the completion of another guided tour
Margaret
headed for the staff kitchen in the palace for</font></b>
      <br>
      <b><font color="#ffffff">&nbsp;a well earned cup of coffee and a
short
rest. After her break she headed towards the door to leave, when she
heard
voices on the other side deep in conversation. Thinking it may be the
janitors
who she had seen in the courtyard previously, Margaret slowly opened
the
door in order to surprise them. Instead it was she herself who got the
surprise as there was not&nbsp; a soul in sight and the voices had
ceased
the moment she had placed her hand on the door handle. Puzzled she
thought
nothing more of it until she had occasion to return to the palace later
in the day. After putting the key into the lock Margaret found it would
not move, struggling for a considerable amount of time the key then all
of a sudden turned with ease.&nbsp; But to her consternation she found
that it would only open several inches before stopping against some
immovable
object, in fact it felt as though the door was being pushed towards
her.
Again she blamed the janitors and called out, "All right very funny,
jokes
over." At that instant the door swung open and Margaret</font></b>
      <br>
      <b><font color="#ffffff">stumbled onto the palace floor. The room
was
empty and there was nothing behind the door that could have caused an
obstruction.
There was also no other exit in the room which some person could have
left
by, namely one of the janitors, as she first thought.</font></b>
      <br>
      <b><font color="#ffffff">It was then that Margaret felt a cold
chill
run down her spine and left as quickly as possible.&nbsp; Tour guide
Michael
has also experienced some odd moments whilst working in</font></b>
      <br>
      <b><font color="#ffffff">the castle, often he has heard music
drifting
down&nbsp; from the minstrels gallery while alone. He has also
experienced
the same difficulty with the palace door as Margaret. One</font></b>
      <br>
      <b><font color="#ffffff">day while taking a tour Michael stopped
by
a portrait of William Boyd in the study. As he gave a, "Flowery"
description
of the obligatory ghost story, the portrait suddenly jumped off its
mountings
and landed face up on the other side of the room&nbsp; at the feet of
two
sightseers. Everyone stood in shocked silence, the amazing coincidence
being that the two who's feet the&nbsp; picture had landed at held the
surnames of Markinck and Titchfield, the same as the two faithful
friends
of William Boyds who traveled down to London with him and gave their
support
at his execution. It was at this point in the narrative that</font></b>
      <br>
      <b><font color="#ffffff">the painting had decided to leap off the
wall.&nbsp;
The castle has a dungeon but the prisoners who died there were sure to
have been breakers of the law rather then prisoners of war. The dungeon
is bottle necked, built purposefully so that there was no escape. Being
fourteen feet from top to bottom&nbsp; the prisoners were literally
thrown
in, many suffering from broken bones in the fall. There are no windows
down there so it was extremely dark and stuffy. When full, as it often
was, the prisoners were barely able to move and were left to die in
their
own bodily wastes. Dug into the dungeons floor was an Oubliette, a</font></b>
      <br>
      <b><font color="#ffffff">French word meaning to forget or cast
aside.
It&nbsp; was a small compartment roughly the size of an average human
being,
which afforded no room to stretch. No one survived for</font></b>
      <br>
      <b><font color="#ffffff">long after the lid was placed into
position.
The prisoners were neither fed nor watered; what a horrible lingering
death
it must have been. The last person said to have died in the oubliette
was
an old woman who allegedly aided the Coventers.&nbsp; A woman visiting
the castle and standing above the dungeon looking down into the murky
blackness
below was suddenly seized with a great feeling of terror. Her chest
tightened
and she felt as though</font></b>
      <br>
      <b><font color="#ffffff">she was going to suffocate right there
and
then.&nbsp;&nbsp; The lady is convinced that she took on the condition
of some one who had died in the hole.&nbsp; There are also tales of a
big
black cat haunting the area.</font></b><b><font color="#ffffff"></font></b>
