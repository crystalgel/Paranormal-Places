      <center><b>Scotland</b></center>
      <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, if I would recommend a
famous haunted
place it would be Fyvie</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>Castle in Scotland. They have a Green Lady (that the Gordon
family
says</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>only appears to them) that might be Lilies D. Drummond, a wife
on
one of</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>the lords in the 1600s (Sometime in the medieval times). The
story
goes</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>that after her death, her husband married another younger
woman
that he</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>had been consorting with in secret. The most interesting thing
about</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>that haunting is that she actually left a signature in solid
stone.
The</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>lord had just married his new bride, and while he was waiting
for
some</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>new bedrooms to be made in the castle he and his wife slept in
a
tiny</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>little unused room. During the night, they heard soft sighs
but
nothing</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>else. When they woke up in the morning, the name Lilies D.
Drummond
was</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>carved deeply into the stone window sill right outside their
room.
It</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>was a few centimeters deep, and carved with great precision.
Obviously</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>it would have taken quite a while to carve in solid stone
using
the</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>primitive tools available then. The most peculiar thing about
that
is</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>that it is carved upside down, so that it faces outside the
window
sill.</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>The only way to read it is to hover or erect a scaffold
outside
and face</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>inside the room, several hundred feet in the air. There was no
possible</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>way or reasoning for a human hand to do this.</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>Another peculiar thing about Fyvie is that it was cursed by
Thomas
the</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>Rhymer. In the curse, there were three stones, one in the
ladies'
bower,</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>water-yett, and somewhere else i can't recall. But if the
three
stones</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>were not collected, disaster would befall Fyvie. For unknown
reasons,</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>although the rhyme doesn't mention it, the curse was taken to
mean
that</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>no direct heir would be born to Fyvie's ruling class and that
is
so.</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>They found the stone in the Ladies' bower, and it is kept in a
bowl
in</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>the castle. sometimes it is bone dry, and at other times it
exudes</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>water. When a rightful heir to Fyvie approached it, it 'gushed
forth
in</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>mournful salutation.' which is a part of the prediction as
well.
The</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>stone was examined, and it turned out to be sandstone, for
which
the</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>water and dryness is a natural phenomenon. The three stones
were
also</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>supposed to come from an ancient cursed church, too. I might
be
wrong</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>about certain details, for it has been a while since i have
read
about</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>Fyvie. I think that there is other paranormal stuff in Fyvie,
but
those</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>are the stories that I recall best.</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>And there is a certain quote from a Lord Of Fyvie, who was a
believer
in</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>ghosts; "Do not try to combat the supernatural. Meet it
without
fear,</b>&nbsp;
      <br>
      <b>and it will not harm you."</b>&nbsp;
