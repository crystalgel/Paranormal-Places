      <br>
      <b>Baltimore, Maryland</b></center>
      <p><b>One of America's most haunted cities happens to be in the
midst of
a</b>
      <br>
      <b>bustling modern city. Westminster Presbyterian Church and
Burying
Ground is</b>
      <br>
      <b>located at the corner of Fayette and Greene Streets in
Baltimore,
Maryland.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>In 1786 a committee from the First Presbyterian Church
Congregation</b>
      <br>
      <b>purchased a peach orchard from John Eager Howard, a wealthy
local
citizen.</b>
      <br>
      <b>It was more than a mile from the center of the city of
Baltimore.
Soon the</b>
      <br>
      <b>affluent were having elaborate tombs built for their departed
relatives.
As</b>
      <br>
      <b>prominent veterans of America's wars started to die off it
also
became a</b>
      <br>
      <b>fashionable place to be buried. Edgar Allan Poe, his wife, and
his</b>
      <br>
      <b>grandfather were buried there, as well as twenty-four generals
and
eight</b>
      <br>
      <b>congressmen. Also interred there are hundreds of men who had
served
in the</b>
      <br>
      <b>Revolutionary War and the War of 1812.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>During the first half of the nineteenth century the city of
Baltimore
spread</b>
      <br>
      <b>further out until Westminster's bucolic surroundings were
converted
into</b>
      <br>
      <b>cobblestones and row houses. In 1850 city officials declared
that
all burial</b>
      <br>
      <b>grounds that did not have a church attached to them had to be
moved
to</b>
      <br>
      <b>outside the city. The Presbyterians wanted no part of this.
Instead,
they</b>
      <br>
      <b>used existing pathways as an area for the walls. Arches were
built
so that</b>
      <br>
      <b>the bereaved could have easy access to the graves underneath
the
church.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>It was about this time that local residents became
concerned about
the</b>
      <br>
      <b>deterioration of the cemetery. Vagrants took shelter under the
arches,
which</b>
      <br>
      <b>led to the arches being cemented closed. During the Civil War
the
Union army</b>
      <br>
      <b>took over the grounds. They stored their weapons in the tombs
and
vaults.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Another problem during the mid-nineteenth century was that
the cemetery
was</b>
      <br>
      <b>located close to Davidge Hall. This was where the local
medical
students</b>
      <br>
      <b>learned their trade by dissecting corpses. Once, two medical
students
were</b>
      <br>
      <b>caught covertly removing bodies to take back to Davidge Hall.
As
they were</b>
      <br>
      <b>caught, the commotion raised a crowd. The mob hanged one of
the
students</b>
      <br>
      <b>from a nearby street light.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>As the twentieth century dawned things declined further.
The cemetery
was</b>
      <br>
      <b>often robbed by vandals looking for jewelry. After World War I
the</b>
      <br>
      <b>neighborhood began changing and Presbyterians worshipped
elsewhere.
Local</b>
      <br>
      <b>kids began using the cemetery as a playground. One minister
reported
seeing</b>
      <br>
      <b>children running around with skulls on the ends of broomsticks.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>The spirits may be wandering because so many of the bodies
have been
moved.</b>
      <br>
      <b>There is doubt that Edgar Allen Poe is actually in his grave.
A
"lost" plot</b>
      <br>
      <b>of Revolutionary War soldiers was discovered to have been
moved
to a vault</b>
      <br>
      <b>under one of the walkways.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>People visiting the grounds have heard mysterious footsteps
and seen
hazy</b>
      <br>
      <b>figures and mists. The most frequently seen spirit is Lucia
Watson
Taylor.</b>
      <br>
      <b>When she died in 1816 she was sixteen years old. She has been
seen
kneeling</b>
      <br>
      <b>in prayer by her own grave, all dressed in white. Three
different
caretakers</b>
      <br>
      <b>quit their jobs after seeing her ghost.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Many psychics and ghost hunters have visited or spent the
night in
the</b>
      <br>
      <b>church. They all confirm that calm, peaceful spirits inhabit
the
burying</b>
      <br>
      <b>ground.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>EVP, or Electronic Voice Phenomenon, is often researched at
Westminster</b>
      <br>
      <b>Burying Ground. During this process an investigator will bring
a
new,</b>
      <br>
      <b>unwrapped tape to the site, then simply record as they walk
around.
Spirit</b>
      <br>
      <b>voices are usually not audible until they are played back, and
even
then</b>
      <br>
      <b>they must be listened to carefully. Researcher Sara Estep
often
records at</b>
      <br>
      <b>Westminster. Among others, she has recorded a woman's voice
saying
"We are</b>
      <br>
      <b>down beside you." and a man saying "I will be there. I will be
there."</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>In 1981 the Westminster Preservation Trust took over the
property
and</b>
      <br>
      <b>restored it as much as possible. It is now open to the public
and
anyone can</b>
      <br>
      <b>visit.</b>
