      <b></b>
      <p><b>The Octagon is an unusually shaped building with many
interesting
ghostly</b>
      <br>
      <b>residents. It is situated one block from the White House in
Washington
DC.</b>
      <br>
      <b>The man who designed the US Capitol, Dr. William Thorton,
designed
the</b>
      <br>
      <b>house. Colonel John Tayloe III, who wanted a home near his
political</b>
      <br>
      <b>friends, built it in 1801. Though called the Octagon, the
house
has only six</b>
      <br>
      <b>sides. It was designed this way in order to fit an unusually
shaped
lot.</b>
      <br>
      <b>Inside are many oddly shaped rooms and closets. The
centerpiece
of the</b>
      <br>
      <b>building is a beautiful oval staircase, the area where the
Octagon's
most</b>
      <br>
      <b>famous ghost is active.</b>
      <br>
      <b>Colonel Tayloe had 15 children, eight of which were daughters
famed
for</b>
      <br>
      <b>their beauty and wealth. Tayloe was also quite patriotic and
often</b>
      <br>
      <b>entertained the likes of Thomas Jefferson, Andrew Jackson and
James</b>
      <br>
      <b>Madison.</b>
      <br>
      <b>During the war of 1812, one of the Tayloe daughters began
having
a secret</b>
      <br>
      <b>love affair with the enemy - a British soldier. As she snuck
back
into the</b>
      <br>
      <b>house one night after meeting her love her father caught her
on
the</b>
      <br>
      <b>stairway. They argued violently about the girl's behavior and
somehow
the</b>
      <br>
      <b>young woman lost her balance. She fell over the railing and
plunged
to her</b>
      <br>
      <b>death. Though Colonel Tayloe insisted it was an accident, his
daughter's</b>
      <br>
      <b>ghost came back to re-enact her death. People have reported
seeing
a</b>
      <br>
      <b>flickering candle shadow moving up the stairs as though
someone
was</b>
      <br>
      <b>walking&nbsp; upstairs with it. Then, there would come a
terrible
shriek and a thud at</b>
      <br>
      <b>the bottom of the stairs.&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>Grief and perhaps this haunting caused Tayloe to move his
family
back to</b>
      <br>
      <b>his Virginia plantation. Rather than have the house sit
vacant,
Mrs.</b>
      <br>
      <b>Tayloe&nbsp; invited the French embassy to occupy the home. A
French
flag was flown</b>
      <br>
      <b>outside.</b>
      <br>
      <b>It is this flag that people believe saved the house during the
war
of</b>
      <br>
      <b>1812.&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1814 British Troops burned the White
House
and many other nearby</b>
      <br>
      <b>buildings.&nbsp;&nbsp; Due to this arson, President James
Madison
and his wife Dolley were</b>
      <br>
      <b>homeless. The Tayloes offered them the Octagon, where they
lived
and</b>
      <br>
      <b>entertained happily until they could move back into the White
House.</b>
      <br>
      <b>Dolley Madison's ghost has been seen roaming the house after
her
death. She is</b>
      <br>
      <b>still wearing her elegant clothes and the feathered turban,
which
she&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>believed, made her look taller. People often smell her lilac
scented</b>
      <br>
      <b>perfume. Also, sounds of horse drawn carriages coming up to
the
house are</b>
      <br>
      <b>believed to be long deceased guests arriving for Dolley's
parties.</b>
      <br>
      <b>When the Madisons left, the Tayloes moved back in. Once again,
a
daughter</b>
      <br>
      <b>fell in love with a forbidden mate and again Colonel Tayloe
caught
her</b>
      <br>
      <b>sneaking up the stairs late one evening. During the ensuing
argument
the</b>
      <br>
      <b>girl's father shoved her in anger, and just like her sister
she
met death</b>
      <br>
      <b>in&nbsp; a fall. It is this incident that people believe is
responsible
for the</b>
      <br>
      <b>cold&nbsp; spot at the base of the oval staircase. People also
get
a feeling that</b>
      <br>
      <b>someone is lying on the floor on this spot. Also, the rug near
this
area</b>
      <br>
      <b>is&nbsp; often found turned back by unseen hands.</b>
      <br>
      <b>The Tayloes sold the Octagon in 1855, after Mrs. Tayloe's
death.
The</b>
      <br>
      <b>building was put to many uses, though tenants never stayed
long.
During</b>
      <br>
      <b>the&nbsp; Civil War the place was used as a hospital. People
still
hear the sobbing</b>
      <br>
      <b>and moans of the dead.</b>
      <br>
      <b>The house was also rented out as apartments. A gambler lived
on
one of the</b>
      <br>
      <b>floors. One night he was shot by a man whom he had cheated at
cards.
The</b>
      <br>
      <b>gambler's ghost is often seen as he was at the moment of his
death,</b>
      <br>
      <b>reaching&nbsp; for his gun.&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1902 the American
Institute
of Architects purchased&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>the property. During&nbsp; their renovation they found the
skeleton
of a young girl</b>
      <br>
      <b>behind a wall, her&nbsp; fists tightly clenched. This
explained
the thumping noises that</b>
      <br>
      <b>had been&nbsp; coming from behind the wall for almost 100
years.
The thumping sounds</b>
      <br>
      <b>stopped when the skeleton was properly buried. The young girl
is
believed</b>
      <br>
      <b>to&nbsp; have been a servant of the house during the time the
French
Embassy</b>
      <br>
      <b>occupied&nbsp; the house. She fell in love with a British
soldier.
During a lover's</b>
      <br>
      <b>quarrel, he killed her and hid her body in the
wall.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The hauntings continue at&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>the Octagon, but it is not as rowdy as it was in&nbsp; the
last
century. A young man</b>
      <br>
      <b>in a US military uniform from the early 1800's&nbsp; has been
spotted
on the stairs.</b>
      <br>
      <b>During the 60's the superintendent had&nbsp; occasional
problems
with the police&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>calling him to say that all the lights&nbsp; were on and the
doors
were open. The man&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>always made sure that everything&nbsp; was properly locked and
shut
off at the end of&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>the day.&nbsp; The Octagon is now the museum of the American
Architectural
Foundation.&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>It&nbsp; is located at 1799 New York Ave. in Washington, DC.
Hours
are Tuesday to</b>
      <br>
      <b>Sunday 10AM-4PM.There is a $2 admission fee.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
