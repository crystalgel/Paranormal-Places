      <b></b>
      <p><b>The mighty Mississippi River, known as the &#8216;spinal cord&#8217; of
the Confederacy,
was crucial to the survival of the Rebels in the western theatre.
General
Ulysses S. Grant knew that to insure victory, the river must be in
control
of the Federals. Without it, the enemy could easily transport troops
and
goods up and down the river at will.</b>
      <br>
      <b>Understanding the importance of this river, Vicksburg held the
key
to the Mississippi. Whoever controlled Vicksburg, controlled the river.
After a series of major battles, the Yankees approached and attempted
numerous
assaults on the city. Realizing the extensive fortifications, and
underestimating
the mettle of their foe, General Grant formulated his plans to lay
siege
to the city.</b>
      <br>
      <b>May 26, 1863, the Federal army severed rebel telegraph and
supply
lines, dug in, and prepared to wait out their equally determined
counterparts.
The southern soldiers and population alike, prepared caves to live and
protect themselves from the random artillery of the Yankee army and
navy
under Admiral Porter.&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>Starvation and disease ravaged the citizens and infantrymen.
After
over a month,&nbsp; Confederate Lieutenant General John C. Pemberton,
realizing
relief was not forthcoming, surrendered the town on July 4, 1863.</b>
      <br>
      <b>With the occupation of Vicksburg, the Federals delivered a
severe
blow to the Confederates, for now control of the Mississippi lay in the
hands of Grant.</b>
      <br>
      <b>Of the occupying forces, a Colonel Wilson and his aide,
Captain
McPherson decided to headquarter at 1445 Harrison Street. This
beautiful
house built in the style of Greek revival, was familiar to Capt.
Harrison,
for he was a resident in Vicksburg before the war. Now seeing the half
starved populace, he would often give food to the local children,
saying
&#8220;I don&#8217;t want the next generation to grow up hating us like this one
does.&#8221;</b>
      <br>
      <b>Unfortunately, the hatred seethed and with the disappearance
of
Capt. McPherson, Colonel Wilson began an organized search for his aide
and friend. It wasn&#8217;t until a few weeks later that the Colonel was
awakened
by a noise in his bedroom. He fell back asleep in his rocking chair,
only
to be awakened again by the motion of someone rocking the chair from
behind.
He leapt up, and there before him was the figure of a man. Upon closer
examination, he realized it was his missing friend, Capt. McPherson.
Horror
pervaded the Colonel as he noticed that the side of the Captain&#8217;s head
was mutilated and his clothes torn and wet. The Captain weakly stated
that
he had been beaten and thrown into the river by former Confederates. He
pleaded to the Colonel that his murder not be avenged, for he didn&#8217;t
&#8220;want
the next generation to grow up hating&#8221; them &#8220;like this one does.&#8221;</b>
      <br>
      <b>In 1984, the house was bought by an architect; not for the
macabre
history, but for its elegant beauty. He had no idea what lay ahead for
him in the realm of the supernatural.</b>
      <br>
      <b>Soon after the purchase, a tour guide was bringing a group
through
the house when one of the tourists asked if the piano in the parlor
worked.
The guide pressed a key to find that it in fact did not work. As the
group
neared the archway, the sound of a beautiful waltz was heard from the
parlor.
Apparently the piano had changed its mind.</b>
      <br>
      <b>As some time passed, the disturbances got worse. One could
feel
the oppressive air as they entered the house. Feeling demonic, this was
new to the establishment. On one particular occasion, a door was
slammed
through it&#8217;s own volition on the hand of the owner, causing injury. On
another occasion, the owner states that as he walked through the
parlor,
he was pushed to his knees from behind, although he was alone.</b>
      <br>
      <b>It was at this time he moved out until an Episcopal exorcism
could
be performed. The atmosphere is that of a benign one now, although
apparitions
of soldiers are seen by startled tourists from time to time. Tour
guides
seem to have the most abundant sightings, since their time in the house
is daily. As for the bloody apparition of Capt. McPherson, he has been
seen too in the time since the war. The house is also home to a woman
apparition
who has appeared in the middle bedroom, with long brown hair and a
homespun
dress.</b>
      <br>
      <b>McRaven is located at 1445 Harrison Street and is open daily
for
tours.</b><b></b>
