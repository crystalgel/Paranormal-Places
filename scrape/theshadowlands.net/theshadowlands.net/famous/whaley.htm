      <center><font size="+1"></font></center>
      <b>Located in San Diego California.&nbsp; The United States
Chamber of
Commerce has</b>
      <br>
      <b>declared the Whaley House as being genuinely haunted.</b>
      <br>
      <b>&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>The house has all of the signs of being haunted.&nbsp;
Apparitions,
cold spots, feelings of</b>
      <br>
      <b>being touched, unexplainable lights, footsteps, rappings,
objects
moving, odd smells&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>and feelings of being watched.&nbsp; All of these and more
have
been observed in the&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>Whaley House since it opened to the public in 1960.</b><b></b>
      <p><b>There was a conflict about where the court house should be
Old Town
or New Town,&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>Thomas Whaley of course wanted it in Old Town.&nbsp; While
away
on business his home&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>was broken into and his wife held at gunpoint while his office
was
ransacked for all the&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>towns papers.&nbsp; This scene is still played out from time
to
time in Whaley House.</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Yankee Jim, a spirit that was hung on the property for
stealing a
boat, lives here.</b>
      <br>
      <b>Yankee Jim Robinson was a tall man with unruly blonde
hair.&nbsp;
He was hung on the&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>property before the Whaley House was built for supposedly
stealing
a boat.&nbsp; His&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>accomplices were let off with much lighter sentences although
no
explanation is given&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>why except that he may have been the mastermind behind the
plan.&nbsp;
There was never&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>any hard evidence found.&nbsp; Yankee Jim had been seen in a
rowboat
in and around the&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>schooner Platus.&nbsp; It was not an easy hanging, sketchy
history
reports claim the gallows were&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>built for men of regular height.&nbsp; Yankee Jim was a very
tall
man, so when they pulled the</b>
      <br>
      <b>wagon out from under him, his feet still touched the
ground.&nbsp;
He strangled to death</b>
      <br>
      <b>proclaiming his innocence.</b>
      <br>
      <b>Lillian Whaley, Thomas Whaley's daughter who lived in the
house
until 1953, claimed it&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>was Yankee Jim's footsteps she heard at night walking the wood
floors.
Today loud</b>
      <br>
      <b>footsteps are heard upstairs when you are downstairs and heard
downstairs
when you are&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>upstairs. And sightings of a tall man with unruly blonde hair
are
reported frequently.&nbsp; His</b>
      <br>
      <b>laughter is said to heard echoing through the hallways of
Whaley
House.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Several other ghosts are said to haunt the house.&nbsp;
Including
an attorney who managed</b>
      <br>
      <b>the Whaley affairs during the Civil War and was said to have
fallen
in love with the house.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>Another spirit is Mrs. Anna Whaley, she likes to play the
piano
to let others aware of her&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>presence.&nbsp; Playful and mischeivous 17 month old Tom
Whaley
has been seen and felt around&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>the museum.&nbsp;</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Events do not occur everyday at the Whaley House.&nbsp; In
fact sometimes
weeks pass&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>before one of the spirits makes itself known to the workers or
the
public.&nbsp; But when it</b>
      <br>
      <b>does, you can bet it is memorable.</b><b></b>
