      <p><b>Lemp Mansion is believed to be one of the most haunted
places in
St. Louis&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>City, and in the top 10 of most haunted in North America.
Located
at 3322</b>
      <br>
      <b>De Menil Pl., across Highway 55, across from the
Anheuser-Busch
Brewery</b>
      <br>
      <b>in the Soulard Area.&nbsp;</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>The Lemp Family seemed to be cursed with death and
depression.&nbsp;</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>It is believed the curse of the Lemp Family started with
William
Lemp Sr.'s&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>son, Fredrick Lemp.&nbsp; Frederick's death, believed to have
been
a heart attack&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>from being over worked, caused William Sr. to fall into a deep
depression,&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>leading to him committing suicide in his bed room by shooting
himself,
and&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>killing his dog.&nbsp;</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>The next to commit suicide was Frederick's sister,
Elsa.&nbsp; Though
not in the&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>Lemp Mansion when she killed herself, her home is believed to
be
haunted as&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>well.&nbsp;</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>William Jr. later married Lillian Hadlan. She was a
beautiful young
woman.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>Her favorite color was Lavender and that is all she wore, thus
her
being&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>nicknamed "The Lavender Lady" (There is a beauty shop 2 blocks
away
from&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>Lemp Mansion called "The Lavender Lady").&nbsp; They
eventually
divorce causing</b>
      <br>
      <b>a&nbsp; great scandal all of St. Louis would talk about
causing
Lillian to go into&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>seclusion.&nbsp;</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>There is a rumor that there was a child born around this
time (possibly
from&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>an affair William Jr. had with a servant) supposedly this
child
was mentally&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>retarded, and deformed in some way, causing the family to keep
him
a secret&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>to avoid humiliation or disgrace.&nbsp; They only know the
child
by the name of&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>Monkey Boy.&nbsp; There is no record of a child like this
being
born to the&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>Lemp's, but he has let himself to be known by psychics that
have
toured the&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>home.&nbsp;</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>William Jr. eventually joined the rest of his family by
shooting
himself in&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>the chest with a revolver, in the Office on the first floor of
Lemp
Mansion, now&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>a dinning room!</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>In the 1970's the mansion was sold to Dick Pointer who
started renovations&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>on the mansion. Many of the workers started complaining of
being
watched by&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>unseen, unwelcoming eyes, disappearing tools, apparitions of a
gentelman
in&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>black, and eerie, unexplained sounds.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Many of these workers left never to return to the
site.&nbsp;</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Now Lemp Mansion is a bed and breakfast where many
employees and
guest&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>report sightings of the Lavender Lady, a phantom dog barking,
cold
spots,&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>the feelings of being watched, disembodied voices, even
glasses
being picked&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>up from off the bar by unseen hands.&nbsp;</b><b></b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Anyone is welcomed to decide for themselves. The next time
you're
in St.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>Louis, Maybe you might want to check out Lemp
Mansion.&nbsp;&nbsp;
You can even&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>
      <br>
      <b>reserve the room that William Lemp Sr. Killed himself in!&nbsp;</b>
