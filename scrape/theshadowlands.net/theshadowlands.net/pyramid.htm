Chambers?</font></font></b></center>
&nbsp;

<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Some recent news may make recent pyramid
discussions redundant!</font></b> <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">What
seems to be a hidden chamber has been discovered in the Great Pyramid.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">(I had to read it a couple of times to
convince myself it was bona fide.)</font></b>

</p><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The German Archaeological Institute
in Cairo was engaged in a project to</font></b> <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">improve
the ventilation of the Great Pyramid.&nbsp; The plan was to clear the</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">two small passages leading from the King's
Chamber, which had become</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">clogged by rubble:</font></b>

</p><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">German engineer and roboticist Rudolf
Gantenbrink was given the task,</font></b> <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">achieved
by the simple expedient of attaching a point to an old lorry</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">axle and dropping it down the shafts; after
which he used a small, tracked</font></b> <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">robot
with a video-camera to study the shafts before fans were installed.</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">He next requested permission to use
his robot to explore a similar passage</font></b> <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">leading
from the Queen's chamber, which lies lower down in the pyramid.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">And this is where the story gets interesting.</font></b>

</p><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The passageway is 20cm square and rises
from the Queen's Chamber at an</font></b> <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">angle
of 45 degrees.&nbsp; It was previously thought to extend no more than</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">eight metres, but Gantenbrink sent his
robot up and it just kept on going</font></b> <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">(very
slowly) for 65 metres.&nbsp; Over the last couple of metres, the walls</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">of the passage changed from rough to finely
polished limestone, and then</font></b> <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">the
robot came to a door.&nbsp; This is possibly of alabaster or yellow</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">limestone, with tongue and groove fittings
suggesting that it might be</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">raised or lowered.</font></b>

</p><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The door has two copper fittings near
the centre, which have been</font></b> <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">variously
described as handles or just plain strips.&nbsp; A gap exists at the</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">bottom of the door, too small for the camera
to see through, and in front</font></b> <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">of
this lies a scatter of black dust.&nbsp; The robot is to be refitted with</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">a fibre-optic lens and light-source later
this year, which should be able</font></b> <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">to
peer through the gap and show what lies beyond the door.</font></b> <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">What's
behind the door?</font></b>

<center><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font size="+2">Ancient Egypt-History
or Future?</font></font></b></center>

<center><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">By Jennifer@theshadowlands.net</font></b></center>

<center><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b></center>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Pyramids have been studied for centuries,
by the greatest scholars,</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">scientists, mathematicians, astronomers,
historians, architects and physicists the world has ever known.&nbsp; So
when I was asked to write about them, I must admit, I was more than a little
intimidated!&nbsp; People have dedicated their entire lives to unlocking
the secrets of these incredible structures and the people who built them.</font></b>

<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Although I&#8217;ve always been fascinated
by them, I&#8217;m just a writer.&nbsp; I research a subject, and come up with
an opinion and then I communicate it.&nbsp; The closest I have come to
the pyramids is visiting the Ramses exhibit when it came to Dallas almost
10 years ago.&nbsp; Other than that, I&#8217;ve seen tons of shows on The Discovery
Channel and The Learning Channel.&nbsp; (There is also some extremely good
data right on this website!)</font></b>

</p><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We know that the Pyramids of ancient
Egypt were built as burial tombs for</font></b> <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Egyptian
royalty.&nbsp; They believed that when you die, you take it all with you.&nbsp;
So everything belonging to the deceased was placed in the tomb as well.&nbsp;
They were built in such a way that they line up with certain stars and
planets at certain times.&nbsp; It&#8217;s really amazing!</font></b>

</p><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">But HOW did they do it?!?&nbsp; I mean,
these people lived 3,000 years ago!&nbsp; And</font></b> <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">we
STILL can&#8217;t duplicate what they were able to accomplish!&nbsp; Let alone
figure out HOW they did it.&nbsp; So what if they really were far more
advanced that we are?</font></b>

</p><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I believe we have STILL barely scratched
the surface of this incredible culture.&nbsp; There is a lot more there
to be discovered.&nbsp; If they were indeed that far advanced, where are
their weapons?&nbsp; Did they have computers?&nbsp; Did they also have
a much more technically advanced energy source?&nbsp; Think about it, what
if they were able to use nuclear energy?&nbsp; Seems to me it could be
used to move 10 ton stones.&nbsp; (Yes, I realize a lot people believe
that they were able to harness mind power and that is how they moved those
stones into place.&nbsp; I am very much open to that possibility, but for
the purposes of this particular article, I chose not to go down that path.)</font></b>

</p><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">And the way they aligned the pyramids
with the stars and specific planetary</font></b> <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">configurations,
where are the instruments they used to measure all of this?</font></b>&nbsp;<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">
If everything, from the life story of the pharaoh to what they ate, to
how</font></b> <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">they ruled and all of their
belongings and how they were used is written in</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">hieroglyphics, why don&#8217;t we know HOW
they built the pyramids?</font></b>

</p><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I have a theory!&nbsp; You know how
when you were a kid, and you watched Bugs</font></b> <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Bunny
cartoons?&nbsp; They were funny and seemed innocent enough, I mean, they</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">were written for kids, right?&nbsp; Have
you seen them as an adult?&nbsp; They are totally different cartoons!&nbsp;
There are many sexual references!&nbsp; In one cartoon, Bugs Bunny is hung
over!&nbsp; You don&#8217;t notice these things when you&#8217;re a kid.&nbsp; It goes
right over your head.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not in a child&#8217;s capacity to understand
these references and undertones, they&#8217;re much too young and immature.&nbsp;
Even though they are right there in front of you, in the cartoon.&nbsp;
But as an adult, with the knowledge and maturity gained, you suddenly see
what you&#8217;ve been missing and see the cartoon completely different.</font></b>

</p><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">What if the secrets to the pyramids
are the same principal?&nbsp; What if it&#8217;s</font></b> <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">ALL
there written in hieroglyphics, but we are not advanced (mature) enough</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">to fully understand and comprehend what
they are saying?&nbsp; What if there are</font></b> <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">no
secrets?&nbsp; What if the real mystery is WHEN are we going to be advanced</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">enough to understand who they were, where
they came from, what happened to them, etc., etc.</font></b>

<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b>

<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">#1 - The year was 1910. Egyptologist
Douglas Murray was sought out by a</font></b> <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">diseased
and ragged looking American. He told Murray he had an offer</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">that would most likely be the most priceless
and important find of his</font></b> <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">whole
career, a mummy case, complete with mummy, of an ancient Egyptian</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">high priestess of the temple of Ammon-Ra
who supposedly lived in Thebes</font></b> <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">around
1600 BC.</font></b>

</p><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Murray was quick to write the American
a check, drawn from the Bank of</font></b> <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">London,
but the check was never cashed. The American died that night.</font></b>

</p><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">A colleague of Murray's&nbsp; told him
the legend behind his new purchase.</font></b> <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The
ancient high priestess had held high office in the then feared Cult</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">of the Dead, helping to turn the once rich
and fertile land in the</font></b> <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Valley
of the Nile into a bare wasteland, a truely desolate place.</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Inscribed on the walls of her tomb were
warnings of death and terror for</font></b> <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">anyone
disturbing her resting place. Believing it was a load of</font></b> <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">poppycock,
Murray laughed at the warning. 3 days later, while on a</font></b> <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">hunting
trip. his gun exploded in his hand, causing him&nbsp; months of</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">almost constant pain spent in hospital.
The wound eventually became</font></b> <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">infected,
and fearing the gangrene would spread, his arm was amputated</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">at the elbow.</font></b>

</p><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">When his health returned he set sail
for England, mummy case and all.</font></b> <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">During
the trip, 2 Egyptian servants who had handled the mummy case were</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">found dead. They were considered to be
young, strong, healthy men, so</font></b> <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">their
deeaths came very unexpectedly. Upon arriving in London, Murray</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">took a good long look at his acquisition,
and while examining the carved</font></b> <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">gold
and painted image of the priestess, he later told friends that "the</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">face seemed to come alive with a stare
that chilled to the bone."</font></b>

</p><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Murray decided t was time to get rid
of the mummy case. A lady friend of</font></b> <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">his
persuaded him to sell it to her, and within weeks her mother died,</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">her lover left her, and she herself was
diagnosed with what could only</font></b> <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">be
called a 'wasting' disease. Was it perhaps the same disease to plague</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">the American? Whatever it was, she insisted
that Murray take it back. He</font></b> <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">then
gave it to a British museum, and it seemed that the 'curse' was no</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">less effective there, either.&nbsp; A photographer
dropped stone cold dead</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">while photographing the mummy case,
and the man in charge of the cases</font></b> <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">exhibit
was soon found dead in his own bed. In light of these events,</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">the museums head honcho's met privately
and unanimously decided to give</font></b> <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">it
to a prestigious New York museum. The case was sent with no fanfare,</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">but the case never reached it's destination,
for it sunk to the bottom</font></b> <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">of
the sea along with the Titanic and almost 1500 souls in April of</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">1912.</font></b>

</p><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"># 2:</font></b> - <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In
1357 BC, King Akhnaton of Egypt, ( the tyrnnical father-in-law of</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Tutankhamen) had his own daughter raped
and murdered by his temple</font></b> <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">priests.
To add eternal insult to injury, they cut off her right hand</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">and buried it in a secret location in the
Valley of the Kings. According</font></b> <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">to
the beliefs of ancient Egyptians, anyone who was not buried whole</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">would forever be barred from entering paradise
in the afterlife.</font></b>

</p><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Centuries later in 1890, Count Louis
Hamon cured a well-to-do sheik of</font></b> <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">malaria.
The sheik insisted that he accept a gift as a token of his</font></b> <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">thanks,
the mummified right hand of an Egyptian princess! Despite its</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">gruesome nature, Hamon accepted the gift,
though reluctanly, and brought</font></b> <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">it
home to England.&nbsp; His wife was instantly horrified by the dry,</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">shrivelled hand. Hamon tried to give it
to an England museum, but they</font></b> <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">would
not accept it. His wife then insisted they keep it locked up in a</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">safe at their home.</font></b>

</p><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">32 years later, in October of 1922,,
the safe was opened and to their</font></b> <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">horror
the hand was plump with new tissue! Hamons wife demanded the hand</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">be disposed of, and Hamon agreed, however,
it was to have the best</font></b> <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">funeral
he could give it. So on Halloween night, Hamon read aloud a</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">passge from the Egyptian book of the dead.
He later wrote to his</font></b> <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">longtime
friend, Lord Carnarvon, that while he read from the ancient</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">book he placed the hand into a blazing
fire in the fireplace and then</font></b> <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">shut
the book. As soon as he closed the book thunder rocked the house</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">and all the lights went out, The door was
then flung open accompanied by</font></b> <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">a
blast of freezing cold air. In Hamon's own words, "the figure of a</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">woman entered wearing the royal apparel
of ancient Egypt,&nbsp; her headdress</font></b> <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">bore
the&nbsp; image of the Serpent of the House of Pharoahs." The womans</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">right arm ended in a stump. The apparition
went to the fireplace where</font></b> <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">the
hand was burning, bent over, and then diappeared, along with the</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">hand.</font></b>

</p><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">4 days later, Hamon learned that the
party his old friend Lord Carnarvon</font></b> <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">had
been funding had finally found the tomb of King Tutankhamen after</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">what had seemed like endless, fruitless
searching&nbsp; and that they,</font></b> <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">despite
the curse written at the entrance of the tomb, planned to enter</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">it. Count Hamon and his wife were in hospital
being treated for severe</font></b> <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">shock.
It was from there that he wrote his friend, Lord Carnarvon,</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">begging him to reconsider opening the tomb.
He wrote, "I know now that</font></b> <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">the
ancient Egyptians had knowledge and power of which today we have no</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">comprehension. In the name of God, I beg
you, take care!"</font></b>

</p><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The letters warning went unheeded and
Lord Carnarvon told his party to</font></b> <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">go
ahead and enter the tomb. Soon afterwards, Lord Carnarvon was dead of</font></b>
<b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">an infected mosquito bite. But that was
only the beginning, more deaths</font></b> <b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">were
to follow, giving rise to what could most probably be the worlds</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">most infamous curse, the Curse of the
Pharoahs.</font></b>
