Subject: Kongomoto

The Kongomoto is suspected to be a living specimen of a Pterosaur. No
pictures of this creature, have ever been taken. There are numerous
stories, from Indian Tribes located in the area. One involve a Man,
seeing one landing within a couple of meters of him. He passed out
however. He said the wings made a loud thunderous noise when "flapped".
There are also reports of a creature said to be the size of an elephant,or bigger, with onehorn protruding from it's head. It is suspected that this animal may bea living specimen of a Ceratopsian. This animal is called Emela-Ntouka(The Killer of Elephats). These Reports come out of the Likouala region of the Congo. Three dead male elephants, according to reports, have been found with large puncture wounds in their sides, this is assumably there cause of death.No pictures of this animal have been taken either however.
