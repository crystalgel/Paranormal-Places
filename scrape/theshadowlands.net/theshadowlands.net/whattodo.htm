<TITLE>What to do if you encounter a UFO</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY><H2>                                     If you should  happen to have an encounter with a UFO, the following       guidelines will provide help.....
</H2><P>
<P>             <B>1. Remain calm and don't panic.</B>
<P>
<P><B>             2. Do NOT attempt to approach the craft if it is on the
ground</B>
<P><B>                or hovering at a low altitude.  There  have been many
cases</B>
<P><B>                in which  witnesses have heat and/or radiation  burns
 from</B>
<P><B>                approaching too close to a craft.</B>
<P>
<P><B>             3. Do  NOT  attempt  to  make  contact with any of the
craft's</B>
<P><B>                occupants.  Your intentions  may  be  mistaken as an
act of</B>
<P><B>                hostility.</B>
<P>
<P><B>             4. REPORT  YOUR SIGHTING. By all means report  what  you
 have</B>
<P><B>                seen, but  don't  bother reporting it to the Air Force,
the</B>
<P><B>                FBI, or local Police.  These  organizations  maintain
there</B>
<P><B>                are no UFO's and as such will simply file your report
away.</B>
<P>
<P><B>                Instead report your sighting to a UFO organization
such as</B>
<P><B>                CUFON, UFORN,  MUFON,  CAUS, or any of a  dozen  other
 UFO</B>
<P><B>                groups.  Chances are these organizations will send
a "field</B>
<P><B>                investigator" to  personally  sit down with you and
discuss</B>
<P><B>                your sighting.</B>
<P>
<P><B>             5. If possible, take a picture  of  the  craft  with a
camera.</B>
<P><B>                DON'T use a flash.</B>
<P>
<P><B>                A flash  on an ordinary camera is only good  for  about
 20</B>
<P><B>                feet and  all  you  will accomplish is letting the
UFO know</B>
<P><B>                exactly where you are (if it didn't know already.)</B>
<P>
<P><B>             6. Note if possible the exact  time of the sighting. This
will</B>
<P><B>                aid in determining the duration of the sighting.  Also
look</B>
<P><B>                around for  familiar  objects  that you can use to
estimate</B>
<P><B>                the size of the craft.</B>
<P>
<P><B>             7. Notice if possible any  unusual  colors  or  shape
 of  the</B>
<P><B>                craft, did the craft produce any sound and  if  so
what was</B>
<P><B>                it.</B>
<P>
<P><B>             8. Notice if possible any related effects caused by the
craft,</B>
<P><B>                i.e. electrical  malfunctions  of  electronic  devices
(car</B>
<P><B>                ignition, radios, etc).   Look  for  ground effects
such as</B>
<P><B>                dust being blown about beneath the craft.</B>
<P>
<P><B>             9. After the craft has left look for any "Traces."</B>
<P><B>                A trace  would  be any physical sign the craft  was
 there,</B>
<P>
<P><B>                i.e.  flattened grass, unusual soil patterns etc.</B>
<P>
<P><B>                DON'T TOUCH ANY AREA THAT HAS SIGNS OF BEING A TRACE,
leave</B>
<P><B>                that to the UFOlogist.</B>
<P>
<P><B>            10. As  quickly  as possible write down exactly what you
saw or</B>
<P><B>                dictate it into a tape recorder.</B>
<P>
<P><B>                As time passes the memory of exact detail may fade.</B>
