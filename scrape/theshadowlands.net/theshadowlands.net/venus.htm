<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Venus is the brightest planet in our
night sky, so bright that it is often visible during the day, too. Although
it is 45 million kilometers away, many people reported sightings of UFOs
when the Venus was up, they claimed UFO was hovering above the neighbourhood...</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It even happened to me once.</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It was the 27th of October, 1997. I
was on my way home from school. At that time of the year, night here usually
falls at about 5 - 6 p.m. It was about 6:30 when I got to my street. I
live at the suburbs of my town so the streets are rather quiet and dark.</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">And then I saw very bright object in
the western sky. It was surrounded by some sort of fog. It looked very
distant and i thought it looks like a comet we saw few months ago. I didn't
watch it for a long time.</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Two years later I got a computer program
'Starry Night Pro 3.0' by Sienna Software. The program shows star and planet
positions for any time, day or year in the past or in the future. So I
set the date: October 27, 1997. And there it was Venus, shining above the
western horizon. I haven't seen it before so I was very surprised by its
brightness...</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">I believe the fog was caused by high
altitude clouds.</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Why is Venus so bright? Its atmosphere
is almost 100% carbon-dioxide. It is very dense so its cloud reflect much
more sunlight than any other planet in the Solar System.</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In 1835, French battleship received
orders from their command to knock-down enemy balloon. Later it was discovered
that there was no enemy: they were trying to shoot Venus.</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">One evening in October 1969, at 19:15,
former US president Jimmy Carter saw UFO suddenly appearing in the western
sky, at approximately 30 degrees altitude. "It was brighter than sky and
clear like a Moon. It changed size to a size of an ordinary planet to the
size of a Moon. It was about 274 - 914 meters (300 - 1000 yards) away."</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">But, UFO skeptic Robert Sheaffer investigated
the event and came up with conclusion that without any doubt, witness saw
planet Venus.</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">One British expert for physics, R. V.
Jones, once wrote an article...</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">"My contact with this object began
about in 1925, when people from Oxted, Surrey (England) told me about a
strong light that moves slowly across the sky every night. Actually, I
knew a married couple who was up all night just to observe it. It was Venus
which attracted them with its brightness; they have never noticed that
stars and planets move across the sky as Earth rotates. Venus really caused
a lot of problems. In 1940 or 1941 we had alert status because of reports
that Germans have a new plane which flies on a very high altitude. The
report came from one defense batterry from Borders. The plane was bright
and they used their instruments to determine how high does it fly. The
answer was 26 000 feet and we were wondering how did they measure it so
accurately. Investigation determined that 26 000 feet was the last mark
on their instrument and their target was again Venus. Same explanation
is for few flying saucers that appeared in the Northern Scotland. Sometimes
we were able to predict when the UFO sightings will be reported, depending
on Venus' position in the sky."</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In autumn 2000, my friend told me that
he observes UFO every night. He said that first he sees a very bright star,
but that star slowly comes lower and lower. When it gets low enough, it
flashes in rainbow colors. I turned on my computer and checked it with
the Starry Night Pro; the time of his sighting perfectly matched with positions
of Venus. What about the rainbow colors?</font></b>
<br><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">When a star or a planet is low in the
sky, its light must pass through more atmosphere than usual. The atmosphere
converts light, and that is why the Sun gets red when it rises or sets.
And that is why brighter planets and stars (like Venus, Jupiter, Mars or
Sirius) change colors when they are low in the sky.</font></b><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There are probably more UFO/Venus sightings
that are not even reported. That mostly happens because people do not posess
basic astronomical knowledge. Can it be so hard just to look at the sky
map?...</font></b>
